 4.  Dividends. 
 (a)  Rate. Holders of Series A will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law, non-cumulative cash dividends from the original issue date (in the case of the initial Dividend Period only) or the immediately preceding Dividend Payment Date, quarterly in arrears on each Dividend Payment Date, commencing on October 15, 2006. These dividends will accrue, with respect to each Dividend Period (as defined below), on the liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (1) three-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR (as defined below) on the related Dividend Determination Date plus .70% or (2) 4%. In the event that the Corporation issues additional shares of Series A after the original issue date, dividends on such shares may accrue from the original issue date or any other date specified by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof at the time such additional shares  are issued. 
Dividends that are payable on Series A on any Dividend Payment Date will be payable to holders of record of Series A as they appear on the stock register of the Corporation on the  applicable record date, which shall be the 15 th calendar day before such Dividend Payment Date or such other record date fixed by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors that is not more than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such Dividend Payment Date (each, a "Dividend Record Date"). Any such day that is a Dividend Record Date shall be a Dividend Record Date whet her or not such day is a Business Day. 
   
 A-3 
 
 
A "Dividend Period" is the period from and including a Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next Dividend Payment Date or any earlier redemption date, except that (i) the initial Dividend Period for any share of Series A issued on the original issue date will commence on and include the original issue date of the Series A and will end on and exclude the October 15, 2006 Dividend Payment Date, and (ii) for any share of Series A issued after the original issue date, the initial Dividend Period for such shares may commence on and include such other date as the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors shall determine and publicly disclose and shall end on and exclude the next Dividend Payment Date. Dividends payable on the Series A will be computed by the Calculation Agent on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the Dividend Period. Dividends for the initial Dividend Period will be calculated from the original issue date. If any date on which dividends would otherwise be payable is not a Business Day, then the Dividend Payment Date will be the next succeeding Business Day unless such day falls in the next calendar month, in which case the Dividend Payment Date will be the  immediately preceding day that is a Business Day. 
For any Dividend Period, LIBOR (the London interbank offered rate) shall be determined by the Calculation Agent on the Dividend Determination Date in the following manner: 
(i) LIBOR will be the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of three months, commencing on the first day of such Dividend Period, that appears on Page 3750, or any successor page, on Moneyline Telerate Inc., or any successor service, at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Dividend Determination Date. 
(ii) If no such rate appears, then the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent after consultation with the Corporation, to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of three months, commencing on the first day of such Dividend Period, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Dividend Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR determined on that Dividend Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR will be determined for the first day of such Dividend Period as the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York time, on that Dividend Determination Date, by three major banks in New York City, as selected by the Calculation Agent after consultation with the Corporation, for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks, for a period of three months, commencing on the firs t day of such Dividend Period, and in a principal amount that is 
   
 A-4 
 
 
representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time. If the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, LIBOR for that Dividend Determination Date will be the same as LIBOR for the immediately preceding Dividend Period, or, if there was no Dividend Period, the dividend payable will be based on  the initial dividend rate. 
The Calculation Agent's determination of any dividend rate, and its calculation of the amount of dividends for any Dividend Period, will be maintained on file at the Corporation's principal offices, will be made available to any stockholder upon request and will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error. 
Holders of Series A shall not be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, securities or other property, other than dividends (if any) declared and payable on the Series A as specified in this Section 4 (subject to the other provisions of this Certificate of Designation). 
Dividends on shares of the Series A will not be cumulative. Accordingly, if the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) does not declare a dividend on the Series A payable in respect of any Dividend Period before the related Dividend Payment Date, such dividend will not accrue and the Corporation will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that Dividend Period on the Dividend Payment Date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series A are declared for any future Dividend Period. 
 (b)  Priority of Dividends. The Series A will rank (i) senior to the Common Stock and any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be junior to the Series A, (ii) junior to any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be senior to the Series A (issued with the requisite consent of the holders of the Series A, if required) and (iii) except as described in the following sentence, at least equally with each other class or series of Preferred Stock the Corporation may issue with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. The Series A will rank junior as to payment of dividends, but on a parity as to amounts payable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, with any Capital Units Cumulative Preferred Stock, any other class or series of cumulative Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue in the future and any other class or series of Preferred Stock that the Corporation may issue in the future that is expressly stated to be senior as to payment of dividends, but on a parity as to amounts payable upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, to the Series A. 
   
 A-5 
 
 
So long as any share of Series A remains outstanding, no dividend or distribution shall be paid or declared on Junior Stock, and no Junior Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly, during a Dividend Period, unless the full dividend for the latest completed Dividend Period on all outstanding shares of Series A has been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). The foregoing limitation shall not apply to: 
   
   â€¢  repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with (1) any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants or (2) a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan; 
   
   â€¢  an exchange, redemption, reclassification or conversion of any class or series of Junior Stock, or any junior stock of a subsidiary of the Corporation, for any class or series of J unior Stock; 
   
   â€¢  the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Stock under the conversion or exchange provisions of Junior Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; 
   
   â€¢  any declaration of a dividend in connection with any stockholders' rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any stockholders' rights plan, or the redem ption or repurchase of rights pursuant to the plan; or 
   
   â€¢  any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the s ame stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equal or junior to that stock. 
 In addition, the foregoing limitation shall not restrict the ability of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, or any other affiliate of the Corporation, to engage in any market-making transactions in Junior Stock in the ordinary course of business. 
When dividends are not paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside) on any Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within a related Dividend Period) in full upon the Series A and any shares of Parity Stock, all dividends declared on the Series A and all such Parity Stock and payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of parity stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within the related Dividend Period) shall be declared  pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the Series A and all Parity Stock payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within t he related Dividend Period) bear to each other. 
Subject to the foregoing, dividends (payable in cash, securities or other property) may be determined by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors and may be declared and paid on the Common Stock and any other stock ranking, as to dividends, equally with or junior to the Series A, from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the Series A shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividends. 
   
 A-6 
 
 
 5.  Liquidation Rights. 
 (a)  Voluntary or Involuntary Liquidation. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, holders of Series A shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof available for distribution to stockholders of the Corporation, after satisfaction of all liabilities, if any, to creditors of the Corporation, and before any distribution of such assets or proceeds is made to or set aside for the holders of Common Stock and any other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series A as to such distribution, a liquidating distribution in an amount equal to $25,000 per share, together with an amount equal to all dividends, if any, that have been declared but not paid prior to the date of payment of such distribution (but without any accumulation in respect of dividends that have not been declared prior to such payment date). Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received their full liquidation pr eference. 
 (b)  Partial Payment. If in any distribution described in Section 5(a) above the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay the Liquidation Preference (as defined below) in full to all holders of Series A and all holders of any stock of the Corporation ranking equally with the Series A as to such distribution, the amounts paid to the holders of Seri es A and to the holders of all such other stock shall be paid  pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate Liquidation Preference of the holders of Series A and the holders of all such other stock. In any such distribution, the "Liquidation Preference" of any holder of stock of the Corporation shall mean the amount otherwise payable to such holder in such distribution (assuming no limitation on the assets of the Corporation available for such distribution), including an amount equal to any declared but unpaid dividends (and, in the case of any holder of stock other than Series A and on which dividends accrue on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to any unpaid, accrued, cumulative dividends, whether or not declared, as applicable). 
 (c)  Residual Distributions. If the Liquidation Preference has been paid in full to all holders of Series A and any other shares of the Corporation's stock ranking equally as to such liquidation distribution, the holders of other stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation (or proceeds thereof) according to their respective rights and  preferences. 
 (d)  Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 5, the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Series A receive cash, securities or other property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange (for cash, securities or other property) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. 
 6.  Redemption. 
 (a)  Optional Redemption. The Series A may not be redeemed by the Corporation prior to July 15, 2011. On or after July 15, 2011, subject to obtaining any then required regulatory approval, the Corporation , at its option, may redeem, in whole at 
   
 A-7 
 
 
any time or in part from time to time, the shares of Series A at the time outstanding, upon notice given as provided in Section 6(c) below, at a redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, together (except as otherwise provided herein below), for the purposes of the redemption price only, with an amount equal to dividends accrued but unpaid for the then current Dividend Period at the rate set forth in Section 4(a) to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption (regardless of whether any dividends are actually declared for that Dividend Period). The redemption price for any shares of Series A shall be payable on the redemption date to the holder of such shares against surrender of the certificate(s) evidencing such shares to the Corporation or its agent. Any accrued and unpaid dividend for the then current Dividend Period payable on a redemption date that occurs subsequent to the Dividend Record Date for a Dividend Period shall not be paid to the holder entitled to receive the redemption price on the redemption date, but rather shall be paid to the holder of record of the redeemed shares on such Dividend Record Date relating to the Dividend Payment Date as provided in Section 4 above. 
 (b)  No Sinking Fund. The Series A will not be subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. Holders of Series A will have no right to require the redemption or repurc hase of any shares of Series A. 
 (c)  Notice of Redemption. Notice of every redemption of shares of Series A shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Subsection shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Series A designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the depositary shares representing interests in the Series A are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company or any other similar facility, notice of redemption may be given to the holders of Series A at such time and in any manner permitted by such facility. Each such notice given to a holder shall state: (1) the redemption date; (2) the number of shares of Series A to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (3) the redemption price; and (4) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surr endered for payment of the redemption price. 
 (d)  Partial Redemption. In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series A at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected either  pro rata or in such other manner as the Corporation may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Corporation shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series A shall be redeemed from time to time. If fewer than all the shares represented by any certificate are redeemed, a new certi ficate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares without charge to the holder thereof. 
   
 A-8 
 
 
 (e)  Effectiveness of Redemption. If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corp oration, separate and apart from its other funds, in trust for the  pro rata benefit of the holders of any shares of Series A so called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date dividends shall cease to accrue on all shares so called for redemption, all shares so called for redemption shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption, without interest. Any funds unclaimed at the end of two years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released to the Corporation, after which time the holders of the shares so called for redemption shall look only to the Corporation for payme nt of the redemption price of such shares. 
 7.  Conversion Upon Regulatory Changes.  If both (i) and (ii) below occur: 
(i) after June 26, 2006, the Corporation (by election or otherwise) becomes subject to any law, rule, regulation or guidance (together, "Regulations") relating to its capital adequacy, which Regulation (x) modifies the existing requirements for treatment as Allowable Capital (as defined under the Securities and Exchange Commission rules relating to consolidated supervised entities as in effect from time to time), (y) provides for a type or level of capital characterized as "Tier 1" or its equivalent pursuant to Regulations of any governmental agency, authority or other body having regulatory jurisdiction over the Corporation (or any of its subsidiaries or consolidated affiliates) and implementing the capital standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any other United States national governmental agency, authority or other body, or any other applicable regime based on capital standards published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision or its successor, or (z) provides for a type or level of capital that in the judgment of the Corporation (after consultation with legal counsel of recognized standing) is substantially equivalent to such "Tier 1" capital (such capital described in either (y) or (z) above is referred to below as "Tier 1 Capital Equivalent"), and 
(ii) the Corporation affirmatively elects to qualify the Series A for treatment as Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent without any sublimit or other quantitative restriction on the inclusion of the Series A in Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent (other than any limitation the Corporation elects to accept and any limitation requiring that common equity or a specified form of common equity constitute the dominant form of Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent) under such Regulations, 
then, upon such affirmative election, the Series A shall be convertible at the Corporation's option into a new series of Preferred Stock having terms and provisions substantially 
   
 A-9 
 
 
identical to those of the Series A, except that such new series may have such additional or modified rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, as are necessary in the judgment of the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors (after consultation with legal counsel of recogniz ed standing) to comply with the Required Unrestricted Capital Provisions (as defined below),  provided that the Corporation shall not cause any such conversion unless the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors determines that the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, of such new series of Preferred Stock, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series A, taken as  a whole. 
As used above, the term "Required Unrestricted Capital Provisions" means such terms and provisions as are, in the judgment of the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors (after consultation with counsel of recognized standing), required for preferred stock to be treated as Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent, as applicable, without any sublimit or other quantitative restriction on the inclusion of such preferred stock in Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent, as applicable (other than any limitation the Corporation elects to accept and any limitation requiring that common equity or a specified form of common equity constitute the dominant form of Allowable  Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent) pursuant to the applicable Regulations. 
The Corporation shall provide notice to the holders of Series A of any election to qualify the Series A for Allowable Capital or Tier 1 Capital Equivalent treatment and of any determination to convert the Series A into a new series of Preferred Stock pursuant to the terms of this Section 7, promptly upon the effectiveness of any such election or determination. A copy of such notice and of the relevant Regulations shall be maintained on file at the principal offices of the Corporation and, upon request, will be made available to any stockholder of the Corporation. Any conversion of the Series A pursuant to this Section 7 shall be effected pursuant to such procedures as the Corporation may determine and publicly  disclose. 
Except as specified in this Section 7, holders of Series A shares shall have no right to exchange or convert such shares into any other securities. 
 8.  Voting Rights. 
 (a)  General. The holders of Series A shall not have any voting rights except as set forth below and as determined by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof or as otherwise  from to time required by law. 
 (b)  Right To Elect Two Directors Upon Nonpayment Events. If and whenever dividends on any shares of the Series A, or any other Voting Preferred Stock, shall have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend pay ments, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods (a "Nonpayment"), the 
   
 A-10 
 
 
holders of such shares, voting together as a class with holders of any and all other series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding, will be entitled to vote for the election of  a total of two additional members of the Board of Directors (the "Preferred Stock Directors"),  provided that the election of any such directors shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and  provided further that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors. In that event, the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically increase by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series A or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting. Such request to call a special meeting for the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors after a Nonpayment shall be made by written notice, signed by the requisite holders of Series A or other Voting Preferred Stock, and delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation in such manner as provided for in Section 10 below, or as may otherwise be required by law. The voting rights will continue until dividends on the shares of the Series A and any such series of Voting Preferred Stock shall have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of such dividends shall have been  set aside for such payment) for at least four regular dividend periods following the Nonpayment. 
If and when dividends for at least four regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for such payment shall have been set aside) on the Series A and any other class or series of Voting Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series A and all other holders of Voting Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each subsequent Nonpayment), the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically decrease by two. In determining whether dividends have been paid for at least four regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment, the Corporation may take account of any dividend it elects to pay for any dividend period after the regular dividend date for that period has passed. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series A together with all series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting together as a single class) to the extent such holders have the voting rights described above. So long as a Nonpayment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the initial election after a Nonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A and all Voting Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a single class). The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
   
 A-11 
 
 
 (c)  Other Voting Rights. So long as any shares of Series A are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Series A and any Voting Preferred Stock at the time outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating: 
 (i)  Authorization of Senior Stock. Any amendment or alteration of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking senior to the Series A with respect to the distribution of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or windin g up of the Corporation; 
 (ii)  Amendment of Series A. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designation, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series A, taken as a whole; or 
 (iii)  Share Exchanges, Reclassifications, Mergers and Consolidations. Any consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series A, or of a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with another entity, unless in each case (x) the shares of Series A remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (y) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series A, taken as a whole; 
 provided ,  however, that for all purposes of this Section 8(c), any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series A or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking equally with the Series A with respect to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation and ranking senior to or equally with the Series A with respect to the payment of dividends will not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of, and will not require the affirmative vote or consent of, the holders of outstanding shares of Series A. In addition, any conversion of the Series A pursuant to Section 7 above shall not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series A. 
If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 8(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all 
   
 A-12 
 
 
other series of Voting Preferred Stock (including the Series A for this purpose), then only such series of Preferred Stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together as a class in lieu of all other series of Preferred Stock. If all series of a class of Preferred Stock are not equally affected by the proposed amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above, there shall be required a two-thirds approval of the class and a two- thirds approval of each series that will have a diminished status. 
 (d)  Changes for Clarification. Without the consent of the holders of the Series A, so long as such action does not adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series A, the Corporation may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series A: 
(i) to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in this Certificate of Designation that may be defective or inconsistent; or 
(ii) to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series A that is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Certificate of Designation . 
 (e)  Changes after Provision for Redemption. No vote or consent of the holders of Series A shall be required pursuant to Section 8(b), (c) or (d) above if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which any such vote or consent would otherwise be required pursuant to such Section, all outstanding shares of Series A shall have been redeemed, or shall have been called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above. 
 (f)  Procedures for Voting and Consents. The rules and procedures for calling and conducting any meeting of the holders of Series A (including, without limitation, the fixing of a record date in connection therewith), the solicitation and use of proxies at such a meeting, the obtaining of written consents and any other aspect or matter with regard to such a meeting or such consents shall be governed by any rules the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may adopt from time to time, which rules and procedures shall conform to the requirements of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, applicable law and any national securities exchange or other trading facility on which the Series A is listed or traded at the time. Whether the vote or consent of the holders of a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series A and any Voting Preferred Stock has been cast or given on any matter on which the holders of shares of Series A are entitled to vote shall be determined by the Corporation by reference to the specified liquidation amounts  of the shares voted or covered by the consent. 
 9.  Record Holders. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation and the transfer agent for the Series A may deem and treat the record holder of any share of Series A as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the Corporation nor such transfer agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. 
   
 A-13 
 
 
 10.  Notices. All notices or communications in respect of Series A shall be sufficiently given if given in writing and delivered in person or by first class mail, postage prepaid, or if given in such other manner as may be permitted in this Certificate of Designation, in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or by applicable law. 
 11.  No Preemptive Rights. No share of Series A shall have any rights of preemption whatsoever as to any securities of the Corporation, or any warrants, rights or options issued or granted with respect thereto, regardless of how such securities, or such warrants, rights or options, may be designated, issued or granted. 
 12.  Other Rights. The shares of Series A shall not have any voting powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other special rights, or qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, other than as set forth herein or in the Certificate of Incorporation or as provided by applicable law.

 CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS OF PREFERENCES AND RIGHTS 
 OF THE 
 10% SERIES B NON-CUMULATIVE NON-VOTING PERPETUAL 
 CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK 
 ($1,000 LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE PER SHARE) 
 OF 
 MORGAN STANLEY 
 Pursuant to Section 151 of the 
 General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware 
 MORGAN STANLEY, a Delaware corporation (the " Corporation"), DOES HEREBY CERTIFY that, pursuant to resolutions of the Preferred Stock Financing Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation adopted on September 28, 2008, the creation of Series B Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, liquidation preference $1,000 per share (" Series B") of the Corporation was authorized and the designation, preferences, privileges, voting rights, and other special rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the Series B, in addition to those set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Corporation, are fixed as follows: 
 1.  Designation. The distinctive serial designation of such series of preferred stock is "Series B Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock." Each share of Series B shall be identical in all respects to every other share of Series B, except as to the respective dates from which dividends thereon shall accrue, to the extent such dates may differ as pe rmitted pursuant to Section 3 below. 
 2.  Number of Shares. The authorized number of shares of Series B shall be 6,045,750. Shares of Series B that are purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation, or converted into Common Stock or another series of Preferred Stock, shall be cancelled and shall revert to authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock provided that this Section 2 shall not apply to any purc hase or other acquisition of shares of Series B by any Subsidiary of the Corporation. 
 3.  Dividends . 
 (a)  Rate. Holders of shares of Series B shall be entitled to receive, only when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof out of funds of the Corporation legally available for payment, non-cumulative cash dividends on the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share at a rate per annum equal to 10%. Declared dividends on the Series B shall be payable from and including the date of initial issuance (in the case of the initial Dividend Period) or the immediately preceding Dividend Payment Date (in the case of Dividend Periods other than the initial Dividend Period), and shall be payable quarterly, in arrears, on each January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15, commencing on Janu ary 15, 2009 (each such date a " Dividend Payment Date "). If any date on which dividends would otherwise 
 
 
be payable shall not be a Business Day (as defined below), then the date of payment of dividends need not be made on such date, but such payment of dividends may be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the Dividend Payment Date, and no additional dividends shall be payable nor shall interest accrue on the amount payable from and after such Dividend Payment Date to the next succeeding Business Day. " Business Day" means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday and that, in New York City, is not a day on which banking institutions generally are authorized or obligated by law or executive or der to be closed. 
Dividends on the Series B shall not be cumulative; Holders of Series B shall not be entitled to receive any dividends not declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof and no interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend not so declared. Accordingly, if the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) does not declare a dividend on the Series B payable in respect of any Dividend Period before the related Dividend Payment Date, such dividend will not accrue and the Corporation will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that Dividend Period on that Dividend Payment Date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series B are declared for any future Dividend Period. Declared and unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. 
Dividends that are payable on the Series B on any Dividend Payment Date will be payable to holders of record of Series B as they appear on the stock register of the Corporation on  the applicable Dividend Record Date, which shall be the 15 th calendar day before such Dividend Payment Date or such other record date fixed by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors that is not more  than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such Dividend Payment Date (each, a " Dividend Record Date"). Any such day that is a Dividend Record Date shall be a Dividend Record Date whether or not such day is a Business Day. 
 The term " Dividend Period" means the period from and including each Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date (other than the initial Dividend Period, which shall commence on and include the date of initial issuance of the Series B and shall end on but exclude the next Dividend Payment Date). Dividends payable on the Series B shall be computed  on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. 
 (b)  Priority of Dividends . The Series B will rank (i) senior to the Common Stock (as defined below) and any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be junior to the Series B, (ii) junior to any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be senior to the Series B (issued with the requisite consent of the Holders of the Series B, if required) and (iii) at least equally with each other class or series of Preferred Stock (as defined below) that the Corporation may issue with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. So long as any share of Series B remains outstanding, no dividend or distribution shall be paid or declared on Junior Stock, and no Junior Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly, du ring a Dividend 
   
 -2- 
 
 
Period, unless the full dividend for the latest completed Dividend Period on all outstanding shares of Series B has been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). The foregoing limitation shall not apply to (i) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with (1) any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants or (2) a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan; (ii) an exchange, redemption, reclassification or conversion of any class or series of Junior Stock, or any junior stock of a Subsidiary of the Corporation, for any class or series of Junior Stock; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Stock under the conversion or exchange provisions of Junior Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; (iv) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any stockholders' rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any stockholders' rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of rights pursuant to the plan; or (v) any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equal or junior to that stock. In addition, the foregoing limitation shall not restrict the ability of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, or any other affiliate of the Corporation, to engage in any market-making transactions in Junior Stock in the ordinary course of business. 
When dividends are not paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside) on any Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within a related Dividend Period) in full upon the Series B and any shares of Parity Stock, all dividends declared on the Series B and all such Parity Stock and payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within the related Dividend Period) shall be declared  pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the Series B and all Parity Stock payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within t he related Dividend Period) bear to each other. 
Subject to the foregoing, dividends (payable in cash, securities or other property) may be determined by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors and may be declared and paid on the Common Stock and any other stock ranking, as to dividends, equally with or junior to the Series B, from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the Series B shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividends. 
 4.  Liquidation Rights . 
 (a)  Voluntary or Involuntary Liquidation. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, Holders of Series B shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof available for distribution to stockholders of the Corporation, after satisfaction of all liabilities, if 
   
 -3- 
 
 
any, to creditors of the Corporation and subject to the rights of holders of any shares of capital stock of the Corporation then outstanding ranking senior to or  pari passu with the Series B in respect of distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, and before any distribution of such assets or proceeds is made to or set aside for the holders of Common Stock and any other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series B as to such distribution, a liquidating distribution in an amount equal to $1,000 per share, together with an amount equal to all dividends, if any, that have been declared but not paid prior to the date of payment of such distribution (but without any accumulation in respect of dividends that have not been declared prior to such payment date). Holders of the Series B will not be entitled to any o ther amounts from the Corporation after they have received their full liquidation preference. 
 (b)  Partial Payment. If in any distribution described in Section 4(a) above the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay the Liquidation Preference (as defined below) in full to all Holders of Series B and all holders of any stock of the Corporation ranking equally with the Series B as to such distribution, the amounts paid to the Holders of Serie s B and to the holders of all such other stock shall be paid  pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate Liquidation Preference of the Holders of Series B and the holders of all such other stock. In any such distribution, the " Liquidation Preference" of any holder of stock of the Corporation shall mean the amount otherwise payable to such holder in such distribution (assuming no limitation on the assets of the Corporation available for such distribution), including an amount equal to any declared but unpaid dividends (and, in the case of any holder of stock other than Series B and on which dividends accrue on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to any unpaid, accrued, cumulative dividends, whether or not declared, as applicable). Holders of the Series B will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received the full amounts provided for in this Section 4 and will have no right or claim to any of the Corporation's remaining  assets. 
 (c)  Residual Distributions. If the Liquidation Preference on the Series B and any other shares of the Corporation's stock ranking equally as to such liquidation distribution has been paid in full, the holders of other stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation (or proceeds thereof) according to their respective rights and preferences. 
 (d)  Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 4, the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the Holders of Series B receive cash, securities or other property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange (for cash, securities or other property) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. 
 5.  Voting Rights. 
   
 -4- 
 
 
 (a)  General . The Holders of Series B shall not have any voting rights except as set forth below and as determined by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof or as otherwise f rom time to time required by law. 
 (b)  Right to Elect Two Directors Upon Nonpayment Events . If and whenever dividends on any shares of the Series B, or any other Voting Preferred Stock, shall have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more Dividend Peri ods, whether or not for consecutive Dividend Periods (a " Nonpayment"), the holders of such shares, voting together as a class with holders of any and all other series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding, will be entitled to vote for the ele ction of a total of two additional members of the Board of Directors (the " Preferred Stock Directors ");  provided that the election of any such directors shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors; and  provided further that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors. In that event, the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically increase by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series B or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting. Such request to call a special meeting for the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors after a Nonpayment shall be made by written notice, signed by the requisite holders of Series B or other Voting Preferred Stock, and delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation in such manner as provided for in Section 16 below, or as may otherwise be required by law. The voting rights will continue until dividends on the shares of the Series B and any such series of Voting Preferred Stock shall have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of such dividends shall have been  set aside for such payment) for at least four regular dividend periods following the Nonpayment. 
If and when dividends for at least four regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for such payment shall have been set aside) on the Series B and any other class or series of Voting Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series B and all other holders of Voting Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each subsequent Nonpayment), the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically decrease by two. In determining whether dividends have been paid for at least four regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment, the Corporation may take account of any dividend it elects to pay for any dividend period after the regular dividend date for that period has passed. 
Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series B together with all series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting together as a single class) to the extent such holders have the voting rights described above. So long as a Nonpayment shall continue , any 
   
 -5- 
 
 
vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the initial election after a Nonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series B and all Voting Preferred Stock when the y have the voting rights described above (voting together as a single class);  provided that the filling of each vacancy shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors. Any such vote to remove, or to fill a vacancy in the office of, a Preferred Stock Director may be taken only at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series B or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders).

 (c)  Other Voting Rights .

 (ii)  Amendment of Series B . Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designations, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series B, taken as a whole; or

In addition, any conversion of the Series B pursuant hereto shall not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series B. For purposes of clarification, no Holder of Series B shall have any voting rights with respect to any binding share exchange, reclassification, merger o r consolidation which complies with the provisions of clause (iii)(x) and (y) hereof. 
If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 5(c) for which a vote is otherwise required would adversely affect one or more but not all other series of Voting Preferred Stock (including the Series B for this purpose), then only such series of Preferred Stock as are adversely affected by and otherwise entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together as a class in lieu of all other series of Preferred Stock. If all series of a class of Preferred Stock that are otherwise entitled to vote on the matter are not equally affected by the proposed amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above, there shall be required a two-thirds approval of the class and a two-thirds approval of each series that will have a diminished status and that is otherwise  entitled to vote thereon.

(3) if the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price is less than $25.25 per share (subject to adjustment pursuant hereto), no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Seri es B. 
(B) The Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices set forth in the table above (and the corresponding prices set forth in clauses (2) and (3) above) are subject to adjustment pursuant he reto and shall be adjusted as of any date the 
   
 -17- 
 
 
Conversion Rate is adjusted. The adjusted Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices (and corresponding prices set forth in clauses (2) and (3) above) shall equal the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices (and corresponding prices set forth in clauses (2) and (3) above), respectively, applicable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price adjustments and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. The number of Make-Whole Shares in the table above shall also be subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section II. 
(iii) On or before the twentieth day prior to the date on which the Corporation anticipates consummating the Make-Whole Acquisition (or, if later, within two Business Days after the Corporation becomes aware of a Make-Whole Acquisition described in clause (i) of the definition of such term), a written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the Corporation, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders as they appear in the records of the Corporation. Such notice shall contain: 
 (A) the date on which the Make-Whole Acquisition is anticipated to be effected; 
(B) the date, which shall be 30 days after the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date, by which the Make-Whole Acquisition conversion option must be exercised; 
(C) the amount of cash, securities and other consideration payable per share of Common Stock or Series B, respectively; and 
(D) the instructions a Holder must follow to exercise its conversion option in connection with such Make-Whole Acquisition. 
(iv) To exercise a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option, a Holder must, no later than the Close of Business on the date by which the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option must be exercised as specified in the notice delivered under Section 10(c)(iii), comply with the procedures set forth in Section 10(b). 
(v) If a Holder does not elect to exercise the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option pursuant to this Section 10(c), the shares of Series B or successor securities held by it sh all remain outstanding but shall not be eligible to receive Make-Whole Shares. 
(vi) Upon a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion, the Conversion Agent shall, except as otherwise provided in the instructions provided by the Holder thereof in the written notice provided to the Corporation or its successor as set forth in Section 10(b), deliver to the Holder such cash, securities or other property as are issuable with respect to Make-Whole Sh ares in the Make-Whole Acquisition. 
   
 -18- 
 
 
(vii) In the event that a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion is effected with respect to shares of Series B or successor securities representing fewer than all the shares of Series B or successor securities held by a Holder, upon such Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion, the Corporation or its successor shall execute and the Conversion Agent shall, unless otherwise instructed in writing, countersign and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Corporation or its successors, a certificate evidencing the shares of Series B or such successor securities held by the Holder as to which a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion was not effected. 
(viii) If a Holder elects to convert its shares of Series B in connection with a Make-Whole Acquisition, such Holder shall not be entitled to an adjusted conversion price pursuant  to Section 10(g) to the extent such Make-Whole Acquisition also constitutes a Fundamental Change. 
 (d)  Registration of Common Stock. In the event that a Holder shall not by written notice designate the name in which shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of such Series B should be registered or the address to which the certificate or certificates representing such shares of Common Stock should be sent, the Corporation shall be entitled to register such shares, and make such payment, in the name of the Holder as shown on the records of the Corporation and to send the certificate or certificates representing such shares of Common Stock to the address o f such Holder shown on the records of the Corporation. 
 (e)  Dividends. If a Non-Mandatory Conversion Date on which a Holder elects to convert Series B is prior to the Close of Business on the Dividend Record Date relating to any declared dividend for the Dividend Period in which such Holder is electing to convert, such Holder will not have the right to receive any declared dividends for that Dividend Period. If a Non-Mandatory Conversion Date on which a Holder elects to convert Series B is after the Close of Business on the Dividend Record Date for any declared dividend and prior to the Dividend Payment Date, such Holder shall receive that dividend on the relevant Dividend Payment Date if such Holder was the Holder of record at the Close of Business on the Dividend Record Date for that dividend. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the Non-Mandatory Conversion Date is after the Close of Business on the Dividend Record Date and prior to the Open of Business on the Dividend Payment Date, whether or not such Holder was the Holder of record at the Close of Business on the Dividend Record Date, the Holder must pay to the Conversion Agent upon conversion of the shares of Series B an amount in cash equal to the dividend payable on the Dividend Payment Date for the then-current Dividend Period on the shares of  Series B being converted. 
 (f)  Outstanding Shares of Series B. Shares of Series B shall cease to be outstanding on the applicable Conversion Date, subject to the right of Holders of such shares to receive shares of common Stock issuable upon  conversion of such shares of Series B. 
 (g)  Conversion Upon Fundamental Change . 
(i) If the Reference Price in connection with a Fundamental Change is less than the then applicable Conversion Price, a Holder may convert each share of Series B 
   
 -19- 
 
 
during the period beginning on the effective date of the Fundamental Change and ending on the date that is 30 days after the effective date of such Fundamental Change at an adjusted conversion price equal to the greater of (1) the Reference Price and (2) $12.625, subject to adjustment as described herein (the " Base Price "). The date of such conversion upon a Fundamental Change is referred to herein as the " Fundamental Change Conversion Date ." 
(ii) The Base Price shall be adjusted as of any date the Conversion Rate of the Series B is adjusted pursuant hereto. The adjusted Base Price shall equal the Base Price applicable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Base Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. If the Reference Price is less than the Base Price, Holders shall receive a maximum of 79.2079 shares of Common Stock per share of Series B (subject to adjustment in a manner inverse to the adjustments to the Base Price). 
 (iii) On or before the 20 th day prior to the date on which the Corporation anticipates consummating the Fundamental Change (or, if later, within two Business Days after the Corporation becomes aware of a Fundamental Change described in clause (i) of the definition of such term), a written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the Corporation, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to  the Holders as they appear in the records of the Corporation. Such notice shall contain: 
 (A) the date on which the Fundamental Change is anticipated to be effected; and 
(B) the date, which shall be 30 days after the effective date of a Fundamental Change, by which the Fundamental Change conversion option must be exercised. 
(iv) On the effective date of a Fundamental Change, another written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the Corporation, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders as  they appear in the records of the Corporation. Such notice shall contain: 
 (A) the date that shall be 30 days after the effective date of the Fundamental Change; 
 (B) the adjusted conversion price following the Fundamental Change; 
(C) the amount of cash, securities and other consideration payable per share of Common Stock or Series B, respectively; and 
(D) the instructions a Holder must follow to exercise its conversion option in connection with such Fundamental Change. 
   
 -20- 
 
 
(v) To exercise its conversion option upon a Fundamental Change, a Holder must, no later than the Close of Business on the date by which the conversion option upon the Fundamental Change must be exercised as specified in the notice delivered under Section 10(g)(iv), comply with the procedures set forth in Section 10(b). 
(vi) If a Holder does not elect to exercise its conversion option upon a Fundamental Change pursuant to this Section 10(g), the shares of Series B or successor securities held by it will remain outstanding but shall not thereafter be entitled to convert in accordance with Section 10(g). 
(vii) Upon a conversion upon a Fundamental Change, the Conversion Agent shall, except as otherwise provided in the instructions provided by the Holder thereof in the written notice provided to the Corporation or its successor as set forth in Section 10(b), deliver to the Holder such cash, securities or other property as are issuable with respect to the adjus ted conversion price following the Fundamental Change. 
(viii) In the event that a conversion upon a Fundamental Change is effected with respect to shares of Series B or successor securities representing fewer than all the shares of Series B or successor securities held by a Holder, upon such conversion the Corporation or its successor shall execute and the Conversion Agent shall, unless otherwise instructed in writing, countersign and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Corporation, a certificate evidencing the shares of Series B or such successor securities held by the H older as to which a conversion upon a Fundamental Change was not effected. 
(ix) If a Holder elects to convert its shares of Series B in connection with a Fundamental Change, such Holder shall not be entitled to Make-Whole Shares pursuant to Section 10(c)  to the extent such Fundamental Change also constitutes a Make-Whole Acquisition. 
(h) A Holder cannot effect both a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion and a Fundamental Change Conversion with respect to a share of Series B. 
(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Certificate of Designations, a Holder of shares of Series B shall not, for a period of 35 calendar days after any Conversion Date, sell any shares of Common Stock or other equity securities it receives upon conversion of the shares it converted on such Conversion Date. 
 11.  Anti-Dilution Adjustments . 
   
 -21- 
 
 
 (a) The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Corporation as follows: 
(i) If the Corporation, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series B is outstanding, issues shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of Common Stock, or if the Corporation effects a share split or share combination in respect of the Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula: 
   
 CR 1   =   CR 0   Ã—     OS 1         OS 0 
 where 
   
 
 CR 0 
    =   the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or the Close of Business on the effective date of suc h share split or combination, as applicable; 
 CR 1 
    =   the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or the Close of Business on the effective date of su ch share split or share combination, as applicable; 
 OS 0 
    =   the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or the Close of Business on the ef fective date of such share split or share combination, as applicable; and 
 OS 1 
    =   the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution, or the Close of Business on the effective date of such share split or share combin ation, as applicable. 
The Corporation will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in treasury by the Corporation. 
(ii) Except as otherwise provided for by Section 11(a)(iv) below, if the Corporation, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series B is outstanding, distributes to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock any rights or warrants entitling them for a period of not more than 45 calendar days from the Record Date of such distribution to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Record Date of such distribution, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula: 
   
 CR 1   =   CR 0   Ã—     OS 0  + X         OS 0  + Y 
   
 -22- 
 
 
 where 
   
 
 CR 0 
    =   the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution; 
 CR 1 
    =   the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution; 
 OS 0 
    =   the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution; 
 X 
    =    the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights or warrants; and 
 Y 
    =   the number of shares of common Stock equal to the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights or warrants divided by the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. 
To the extent that shares of common Stock are not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants upon the expiration or termination of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the distribution of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of the deli very of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. 
In determining the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights or warrants, there shall be taken into account any amount payable on exercise thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than Cash, to be determined in good faith by the Corporation's Board of Directors. 
   
 -23- 
 
 
(iii) If the Corporation, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series B is outstanding, shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock shares of any class of Capital Stock of the Corporation (other than Common Stock as covered by Section 11(a)(i) above), evidences of its indebtedness, assets, property or rights or warrants to acquire the Corporation's Capital Stock or other securities, but excluding (i) dividends or distributions as to which an adjustment under Section 11(a)(i), Section 11(a)(ii) or Section 11(a)(iv) hereof shall apply, (ii) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in Cash and (iii) Spin-Offs to which the provision set forth below in this Section 11(a)(iii) shall apply (any of such shares of Capital Stock, indebtedness, assets, property or rights or warrants to acquire the Corporation's Common Stock or  other securities, hereinafter in this Section 11(a)(iii) called the " Distributed Property "), then, in each such case the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula: 
   
 CR 1   =   CR 0   Ã—     SP 0         SP 0  - FMV 
 Where 
   
 
 CR 0 
    =   the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution; 
 CR 1 
    =   the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution; 
 SP 0 
    =   the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such dist ribution; and 
 FMV 
    =   the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Corporation's Board of Directors) of the portion of Distributed Property with respect to each outstanding share of Common  Stock on the Record Date for such distribution. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of the Distributed Property so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is  equal to or greater than SP 0 as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, the Corporation shall distribute to each Holder on the date the Distributed Property is distributed to holders of Common Stock, but without requiring such Holder to convert its shares of Series B, the amount of Distributed Property such Holder would have received had such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the record date fixed for determination for stockholders entitled to receive such distribution. If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it shall in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock for purposes of calculating SP 0  in the formula in this Section 11(a)(iii). 
   
 -24- 
 
 
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 11(a)(iii) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock consisting of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Corporation (a " Spin-Off"), the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the Close of Business on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off shall b e increased based on the following formula: 
   
 CR 1   =   CR 0   Ã—     FMV + MP 0         MP 0 
 where 
   
 
 CR 0 
    =    the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business on the 10 th  Trading Day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off; 
 CR 1 
    =    the new Conversion Rate in effect from and after the Close of Business on the 10 th  Trading Day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin Off; 
 FMV 
    =   the average of the Closing Prices of the Capital Stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of common Stock applicable to one share of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off; and 
 MP 0 
    =   the average of the Closing Prices of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off. 
 Such adjustment shall occur on the 10 th Trading Day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off (it being agreed that notwithstanding Section 9(a), the Holder of the Series B shall not be en titled to convert the Series B pursuant to an Early Conversion prior to such 10 th  Trading Day). 
For purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii), Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii) hereof, any dividend or distribution to which this Section 11(a)(iii) is applicable that also includes shares of common Stock, or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock to which Section 11(a)(i) or 11(a)(ii) hereof applies (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets or shares of Capital Stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants to which Section 11(a)(i) or 11(a)(ii) hereof applies (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 11(a)(iii) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights or warrants to which Section 11(a)(i) or 11(a)(ii) hereof applies (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 11(a)(i) and 11(a)(ii) hereof with respect to such dividend or distribution 
   
 -25- 
 
 
shall then be made), except (A) the Close of Business on the Record Date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted for "the Close of Business on the Record Date," "the Close of Business on the Record Date or the Close of Business on the effective date," "after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution or the Close of Business on the effective date of such share split or share combination" and "the Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution" within the meaning of Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii) hereof and (B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date or the Close of Business on the effective date" within the meaning of Section 11(a)(i) hereof. 
(iv) If the Corporation, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series B is outstanding, distributes rights or warrants to all holders of Common Stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for, purchase or convert into shares of the Corporation's Capital Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until  the occurrence of a specified event or events (" Trigger Event"): (x) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (y) are not exercisable; and (z) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of Section 11(a)(iii) above, (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under Section 11(a)(iii) above will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event and a distribution or deemed distribution under the terms of such rights or warrants at which time an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made in the same manner as provided for under Section 11(a)(iii) above. If any such rights or warrants are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Record Date with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 11(a)(iv) was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a Cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights or warrants had not been issued. 
   
 -26- 
 
 
(v) (1) If the Corporation, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series B is outstanding, makes a regular, quarterly Cash dividend or distribution to all or substantia lly all holders of Common Stock during any quarterly fiscal period that exceeds $0.27 (the " Initial Dividend Threshold "), the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula: 
   
 CR 1   =   CR 0   Ã—     SP 0         SP 0  - C 
 where 
   
 
 CR 0 
    =   the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution; 
 CR 1 
    =   the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution; 
 SP 0 
    =   the average Closing Price of the Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Days ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distri bution; 
 C 
    =   the amount in Cash per share the Corporation distributes or dividends to holders of Common Stock in excess of the Initial Dividend Threshold. 
The Initial Dividend Threshold shall be adjusted in a manner inversely proportional to adjustments to the Conversion Rate;  provided that no adjustment shall be made to the Initial Dividend Threshold for any adjustment made to the Conversion Rate pursuant to clauses (1) or (2) of this Section 11(a)(v). 
(2) If the Corporation pays any cash dividend or distribution that is not a regular, quarterly cash dividend or distribution to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, th e Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula: 
   
 CR 1   =   CR 0   Ã—     SP 0         SP 0  - C 
 where 
   
 
 CR 0 
    =   the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution; 
   
 -27- 
 
 
 
 CR 1 
    =   the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution; 
 SP 0 
    =   the average Closing Price of the Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Days ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distri bution; 
 C 
    =    the amount in Cash per share the Corporation distributes or dividends to holders of common Stock 
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the portion of the Cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than SP 0 as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, the Corporation shall distribute to each Holder on the date the Cash dividend or distribution is paid to holders of Common Stock, but without requiring such Holder to convert its shares of Series B, the amount of Cash such Holder would have received had such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. 
(4) For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 11(a)(v), in the event of any reclassification of the Common Stock, as a result of which the Series B becomes convertible into more than one class of Common Stock, if an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required pursuant to this Section 11(a)(v), references in this Section to one share of Common Stock or Closing Price of one share of Common Stock shall be deemed to refer to a unit or to the price of a unit consisting of the number of shares of each class of Common Stock into which the Series B is then convertible equal to the numbers of shares of such class issued in respect of one share of Common Stock in such reclassification. The above provisio ns of this paragraph shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications. 
(vi) If the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment of Cash or other consideration in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for all or any portion of the Common Stock, where such Cash and the value of any such other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date (the "expiration date") on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it  may be amended), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula: 
   
 CR 1   =   CR 0   Ã—     AC + (SP 1  Ã— OS 1 )         OS 0  Ã— SP 1 
   
 -28- 
 
 
 Where 
   
 
 CR 0 
    =    the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business on the expiration date; 
 CR 1 
    =    the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on the expiration date; 
 AC 
    =   the aggregate value of all Cash and any other consideration (as determined in good faith by the Corporation's Board of Directors) paid or payable for shares purchased in such tende r or exchange offer; 
 OS 0 
    =   the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the date such tender or exchange offer expires; 
 OS 1 
    =   the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the date such tender or exchange offer expires (after giving effect to such tender offer or exchange offer); and 
 SP 1 
    =   the average Closing Price of Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Days ending on the Trading Day next succeeding the expiration date. 
If the Corporation or a Subsidiary is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Corporation or such Subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all or any portion of such purchases are rescinded, then the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made or had only been made in respect of the purchases that had been effected. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, if an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 11(a)(vi) with respect to any tender offer or exchange offer would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer or exchange offer under this Section 11(a)(vi). 
 (vii) For purposes of this Section 11(a) the term " Record Date" shall mean, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of Common Stock have the right to receive any Cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of Cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such Cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise). 
   
 -29- 
 
 
(viii) If application of the formulas provided in Sections 11(a)(i), 11(a)(ii), 11(a)(iii), 11(a)(iv), 11(a)(v) or 11(a)(vi) above would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment (other than a readjustment as described in such sections) to the Conversion Rate shall be made except in the case of a share split or combination of the Common Stoc k. 
(ix) If one or more events occur requiring an adjustment be made to the Conversion Rate for a particular period, adjustments to the Conversion Rate shall be determined by the Corporation's Board of Directors to reflect the combined impact of such Conversion Rate adjustments, as set out in this Section 11(a), during such period. 
(x) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing clauses in this Section II, no adjustment in the Conversion Rate shall be required unless the adjustment would result in a change in the Co nversion Rate of at least 1.00%;  provided ,   however, that any adjustment which by reason of this Section 11(a)(x) is not required to be made shall be carried forward and the Corporation shall make such adjustment, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than 1.00%, within one year of the first such adjustment carried forward or in connection with any conversion of Series B. All calculations under this Section 11 shall be made to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share, as the case may be. 
No adjustment in the Conversion Rate need be made (i) for issuances of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan for reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Corporation's securities or the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan, (ii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of, or assumed by, the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the date the Series B was first issued, (iv) for a change in the par value of the Common Stock, (v) for repurchases of shares of common Stock in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions, or (vi) for accumulated and unpaid dividends, other than as expressly contemplated by Section 11(a)(i). 
No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made pursuant to Section 11(a)(i) through (ix) above for a transaction if Holders are permitted to participate in the transaction without conversion, concurrently with the holders of Common Stock, on a basis and with notice that the Board of Directors of the Corporation determines in good faith to be fair and appropriate in light of the basis and notice to holders of Common Stock participating in the transaction. 
Whenever a provision of this Certificate of Designations requires the calculation of an average of the Closing Price over a span of multiple days, the Corporation will make appropriate adjustments to account for any adjustment to the Conversion Rate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the Conversion Rate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the Conversion Rate where the Ex-Dividend Date of the event occurs, at any time during the period from which the average is to be calculated.

(xi) Upon conversion of the Series B, the Holders shall receive, in addition to any shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, any associated rights issued under any shareholder rights agreement of the Corporation that provides that each share of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Series B at any time prior to the distribution of separate certificates representing such rights will be entitled to receive such rights unless, prior to conversion, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, expired, terminated or been redeemed or exchanged in accordance with such rights plan, and no adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 11(a)(iv) hereof. If, prior to any conversion, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Corporation distributed to all holders of Common Stock, shares of Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets, property or rights or warrants as described in Section 11(a)(iv) hereof, subject to readjustment in the event of the  expiration, termination or redemption of such rights. 
(xii) Subject to applicable stock exchange rules and listing standards, the Corporation shall be entitled to increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for a period of at least 20 Business Days if the Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the best interests in the Corporation;  provided the Corporation has given to the Conversion Agent and DTC at least 15 days' prior notice of any such increase in the Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect. Subject to applicable stock exchange rules and listing standards, the Corporation shall be entitled to increase the Conversion Rate, in addition to the events requiring an increase in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 11 hereof, as it in its discretion shall determine to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any tax to shareholders in connection with any stock dividends, subdivisions of shares, distributions of rights to purchase stock or securities or distributions of securities convertible into or exchangeable for sto ck hereafter made by the Corporation to its shareholders or other events. 
(xiii) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Corporation will issue a notice to the Conversion Agent and DTC containing the relevant information and make this information available on the Corporation's website. In addition, the Corporation shall provide upon the request of a Holder of Series B, to the extent not posted on the Corporation website, a brief statement setting forth in reasonable detail how the adjustment to the Conversion Rate was determined and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate. 
(xiv) For purposes of this Section 11, the number of shares of common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Corporation but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. 
(xv) If the record date for a dividend or distribution on Common Stock occurs prior to a Mandatory Conversion Date and the payment date for a dividend or distribution on Common Stock occurs after a Mandatory Conversion Date, and such dividend or distribution would have resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate if such dividend or distribution does not result in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate but were paid prior to such Mandatory Conversion Date, then without duplication the Corporation shall deem the Holders to be holders 
   
 -31- 
 
 
of record of Common Stock for purposes of that dividend or distribution. In that case, the Holders will receive the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the applicable Mandatory Conversion Date together with the dividend or distribution on such shares of Common Stock so converted. 
 12.  Reorganization Events. 
 (a) In the event of: 
(i) any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another Person or of another Person with or into the Corporation; 
(ii) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of the property of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety; 
(iii) any statutory share exchange of the Corporation with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition); or 
 (iv) any liquidation, dissolution or termination of the Corporation; 
in each case in which holders of Common Stock would be entitled to receive cash, securities or other property for their shares of Common Stock (any such event specified in this Sec tion 12(a), a " Reorganization Event"), each share of Series B outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization Event shall, without the consent of Holders, become convertible into the kind of cash, securities and other property receivable in such Reorganization Event by a holder of one share of common Stock that was not the counterparty to the Reorganization Event or an affiliate of such  other party (such cash, securities and other property, the " Exchange Property "). 
(b) In the event that holders of the shares of the Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, the "Exchange Property" that Holders of the Series B will be entitled to receive shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election (or of all such holders if none make an election). The number of units of Exchange Property for each share of Series B converted following the effective date of such Reorganization Event shall be determined based on the Conversion Rate then in effect on the applicable Conversion Date, determined as if the references to a  "share of Common Stock" in this Certificate of Designations were to "unit of Exchange Property." 
(c) After a Reorganization Event, for purposes of determining whether a Mandatory Conversion Date has occurred, the term "Closing Price" shall be deemed to refer to the closing sale price, last quoted bid price or mid-point of the last bid and ask prices, as the case may be, of any publicly traded securities that comprise all or part of the Exchange Property. For purposes of this Section 12, references to Common Stock in the definition of "Trading Day" shall be replaced by references to any publicly traded securities that comprise all  or part of the Exchange Property. 
   
 -32- 
 
 
(d) The above provisions of this Section 12 shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events and the provisions of Section 11 shall apply to any shares of capital stock of the Corporation (or any successor) received by the holders of the Common Stock in any such Reorganization Event. 
(e) The Corporation (or any successor) shall, within 20 days of the occurrence of any Reorganization Event, provide written notice to the Holders of such occurrence of such event and of the kind and amount of the cash, securities or other property that constitutes the Exchange Property. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the operation of this Se ction 12 or the validity of any Reorganization Event. 
 13.  Fractional Shares. 
(a) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued as a result of any conversion of shares of Series B. 
(b) In lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable in respect of any mandatory conversion pursuant to Section 10(a) or a conversion at the option of the Holder pursuant to Section 9(a), Section 10(c) or Section 10(g), the Corporation shall pay an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) equal to the same fraction of: 
(i) in the case of a mandatory conversion pursuant to Section 10(a), a Make Whole Acquisition conversion pursuant to Section 10(c) or a Conversion Upon Fundamental Change pursuant to Section 10(g), the average of the Closing Prices over the five consecutive Trading Day period preceding the Trading Day immediately preceding the applicable Conversion Date; or 
(ii) in the case of an Early Conversion pursuant to Section 9(a), the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the second Trading Day immediately preceding the Early Conversion Date. 
(c) If more than one share of the Series B is surrendered for conversion at one time by or for the same Holder, the number of full shares of common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of the Series B so surrendered. 
 14.  Reservation of common Stock. 
(a) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock or shares held in the treasury by the Corporation, solely for issuance upon the conversion of shares of Series B as provided in this Certificate of Designations, free from any preemptive or other similar rights, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be issuable upon the conversion of all the shares of Series B then outstanding. For purposes of this Section 14(a), the number of shares of common Stock that shall be deliverable upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series B shall be computed as if at the time of computation all such outstanding shares were held by  a single Holder. 
   
 -33- 
 
 
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall be entitled to deliver upon conversion of shares of Series B, as herein provided, shares of Common Stock acquired by the Corporation (in lieu of the issuance of authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock), so long as any such acquired shares are free and clear of all liens, charges, security interests or encumbrances (other than liens, charges, security interests and other encumbrances created by the Holders). 
(c) All shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Series B shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, free and clear of all liens, claims, security interests and other encumbrances (other than liens, charges, security interests and other encumbrances created by the Holders). 
(d) Prior to the delivery of any securities that the Corporation shall be obligated to deliver upon conversion of the Series B, the Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all federal and state laws and regulations thereunder requiring the registration of such securities with, or any approval of or consent to the delivery thereof by,  any governmental authority. 
(e) The Corporation hereby covenants and agrees that, if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange or automated quotation system, the Corporation will, if permitted by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system, list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or automated quotation system, all the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B;  provided , however, that if the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system permit the Corporation to defer the listing of such Common Stock until the first conversion of Series B into Common Stock in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Corporation covenants to list such Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B in accordance with the requirements  of such exchange or automated quotation system at such time. 
 15.  Record Holders. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation and the transfer agent for the Series B may deem and treat the record holder of any share of Series B as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the Corporation nor such transfer agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. 
 16.  Notices. All notices or communications in respect of Series B shall be sufficiently given if given in writing and delivered in person or by first class mail, postage prepaid, or if given in such other manner as may be permitted in this Certificate of Designations, in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or by applicable law. 
 17.  Preemptive or Subscription Rights. Except as expressly provided in any agreement between a Holder and the Corporation, no share of Series B shall have any rights of preemption whatsoever as to any securities of the Corporation, or any warrants, rights or options issued or granted with respect thereto, regardless of how such securities, or such warrants, rights or options, may be designated,  issued or granted. 
   
 -34- 
 
 
 18.  Repurchase. Subject to the limitations imposed herein, the Corporation may purchase and sell shares of Series B from time to time to such extent, in such manner, and upon such terms as the B oard or any duly authorized committee of the Board may determine;  provided, however, that the Corporation shall not use any of its funds for any such purchase when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Corporation is, or by such purchase would be, rend ered insolvent. 
 19.  Other Rights. The shares of Series B shall not have any voting powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other special rights, or qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, other than as set forth herein or in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation or as provided by applicable law.

 AMENDED 
 CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS OF PREFERENCES AND RIGHTS 
 OF THE 
 10% SERIES B NON-CUMULATIVE NON-VOTING PERPETUAL 
 CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK 
 ($1,000 LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE PER SHARE) 
 OF 
 MORGAN STANLEY 
 Pursuant to Section 151 of the 
 General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware 
 MORGAN STANLEY, a Delaware corporation (the " Corporation "), DOES HEREBY CERTIFY: 
A. That, pursuant to resolutions of the Preferred Stock Financing Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation adopted on September 28, 2008, and by a Certificate of Designations filed in the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on October 10, 2008, the Corporation authorized the issuance of 6,045,750 shares of 10% Series B Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, liquidation preference $1,000 per share (" Series B"), of the Corporation and established the designation, preferences, privileges, voting rights, and other special rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the Ser ies B; 
 B. That no shares of Series B have been issued; 
C. That, pursuant to resolutions of the Preferred Stock Financing Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation adopted on October 12, 2008, the Corporation adopted the following resolution amending the Certificate of Designations of the Series B and increasing the number of shares designated as Series B: 
"RESOLVED, that, pursuant to Section 151(g) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Certificate of Designations of Rights and Preferences of the 10% Series B Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock of the Corporation be and hereby is amended to read in its entirety as follows, and the number of shares designated as Series B Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock of the Corporation be increased from 6,045,750 to 7,839,209:" 
 1.  Designation. The distinctive serial designation of such series of preferred stock is "Series B Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock." Each share of Series B shall be identical in all respects to every other share of Series B, except as to the respective dates from which dividends thereon shall accrue, to the extent such dates may differ as pe rmitted pursuant to Section 3 below. 
 
 
 2.  Number of Shares. The authorized number of shares of Series B shall be 7,839,209. Shares of Series B that are purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation, or converted into Common Stock or another series of Preferred Stock, shall be cancelled and shall revert to authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock provided that this Section 2 shall not apply to any purc hase or other acquisition of shares of Series B by any Subsidiary of the Corporation. 
 3.  Dividends . 
 (a)  Rate. Holders of shares of Series B shall be entitled to receive, only when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof out of funds of the Corporation legally available for payment, non-cumulative cash dividends on the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share at a rate per annum equal to 10%;  provided, that, if Stockholder Approval has not been received by February 17, 2009, if such Stockholder Approval is then required for the conversion of all of the Series B without a Violation, the per annum rate shall be increased to 13% per annum on and including February 17, 2009 and shall remain in effect until the date upon which Stockholder Approval is received or no longer required. Declared dividends on the Series B shall be payable from and including the date of initial issuance (in the case of the initial Dividend Period) or the immediately preceding Dividend Payment Date (in the case of Dividend Periods other than the initial Dividend Period), and shall be payable quarterly, in arrears, on each January 15, Ap ril 15, July 15 and October 15, commencing on January 15, 2009 (each such date a " Dividend Payment Date"). If any date on which dividends would otherwise be payable shall not be a Business Day (as defined below), then the date of payment of dividends need not be made on such date, but such payment of dividends may be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the Dividend Payment Date, and no additional dividends shall be payable nor shall interest accrue on the amount payable from and after such Dividend Payment Date to the next succeeding Business Day. " Business Day" means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday and that, in New York City, is not a day on which banking institutions generally are authorized or obligated by law or executive or der to be closed. 
Dividends on the Series B shall not be cumulative; Holders of Series B shall not be entitled to receive any dividends not declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof and no interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend not so declared. Accordingly, if the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) does not declare a dividend on the Series B payable in respect of any Dividend Period before the related Dividend Payment Date, such dividend will not accrue and the Corporation will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that Dividend Period on that Dividend Payment Date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series B are declared for any future Dividend Period. Declared and unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. 
Dividends that are payable on the Series B on any Dividend Payment Date will be payable to holders of record of Series B as they appear on the stock register of the Corporation on  the applicable Dividend Record Date, which shall be the 15 th calendar day before such Dividend Payment Date or such other record date fixed by the Board of Directors or a duly 
   
 -2- 
 
 
authorized committee of the Board of Directors that is not more than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such Dividend Payment Date (each, a " Dividend Record Date"). Any such day that is a Dividend Record Date shall be a Dividend Record Date whether or not such day is a Business Day. 
 The term " Dividend Period" means the period from and including each Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date (other than the initial Dividend Period, which shall commence on and include the date of initial issuance of the Series B and shall end on but exclude the next Dividend Payment Date). Dividends payable on the Series B shall be computed  on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. 
 (b)  Priority of Dividends. The Series B will rank (i) senior to the Common Stock (as defined below) and any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be junior to the Series B, (ii) junior to any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be senior to the Series B (issued with the requisite consent of the Holders of the Series B, if required) and (iii) at least equally with each other class or series of Preferred Stock (as defined below) that the Corporation may issue with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. So long as any share of Series B remains outstanding, no dividend or distribution shall be paid or declared on Junior Stock, and no Junior Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly, during a Dividend Period, unless the full dividend for the latest completed Dividend Period on all outstanding shares of Series B has been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). The foregoing limitation shall not apply to (i) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with (1) any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants or (2) a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan; (ii) an exchange, redemption, reclassification or conversion of any class or series of Junior Stock, or any junior stock of a Subsidiary of the Corporation, for any class or series of Junior Stock; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Stock under the conversion or exchange provisions of Junior Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; (iv) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any stockholders' rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any stockholders' rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of rights pursuant to the plan; or (v) any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equal or junior to that stock. In addition, the foregoing limitation shall not restrict the ability of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, or any other affiliate of the Corporation, to engage in any market-making transactions in Junior Stock in the ordinary course of business. 
When dividends are not paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside) on any Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within a related Dividend Period) in full upon the Series B and any shares of Parity Stock, all 
   
 -3- 
 
 
dividends declared on the Series B and all such Parity Stock and payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within the related Dividend Period) shall be declared  pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the Series B and all Parity Stock payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within t he related Dividend Period) bear to each other. 
Subject to the foregoing, dividends (payable in cash, securities or other property) may be determined by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors and may be declared and paid on the Common Stock and any other stock ranking, as to dividends, equally with or junior to the Series B, from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the Series B shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividends. 
 4.  Liquidation Rights . 
 (a)  Voluntary or Involuntary Liquidation. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, Holders of Series B shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof available for distribution to stockholders of the Corporation, after satisfaction of all liabilities, if any, to creditors of the Corporation and subject to the rights of holders of any shares of capital stock of the Corporation then outstanding ranking senior to or  pari passu with the Series B in respect of distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, and before any distribution of such assets or proceeds is made to or set aside for the holders of Common Stock and any other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series B as to such distribution, a liquidating distribution in an amount equal to $1,000 per share, together with an amount equal to all dividends, if any, that have been declared but not paid prior to the date of payment of such distribution (but without any accumulation in respect of dividends that have not been declared prior to such payment date). Holders of the Series B will not be entitled to any o ther amounts from the Corporation after they have received their full liquidation preference. 
 (b)  Partial Payment. If in any distribution described in Section 4(a) above the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay the Liquidation Preference (as defined below) in full to all Holders of Series B and all holders of any stock of the Corporation ranking equally with the Series B as to such distribution, the amounts paid to the Holders of Seri es B and to the holders of all such other stock shall be paid  pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate Liquidation Preference of the Holders of Series B and the holders of all such other stock. In any such distribution, the " Liquidation Preference" of any holder of stock of the Corporation shall mean the amount otherwise payable to such holder in such distribution (assuming no limitation on the assets of the Corporation available for such distribution), including an amount equal to any declared but unpaid dividends (and, in the case of any holder of stock other than Series B and on which dividends ac crue on a cumulative basis, an 
   
 -4- 
 
 
amount equal to any unpaid, accrued, cumulative dividends, whether or not declared, as applicable). Holders of the Series B will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received the full amounts provided for in this Section 4 and will have no right or claim to any of the Corporation's remaining assets. 
 (c)  Residual Distributions. If the Liquidation Preference on the Series B and any other shares of the Corporation's stock ranking equally as to such liquidation distribution has been paid in full, the holders of other stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation (or proceeds thereof) according to their respective rights and preferences . 
 (d)  Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 4, the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the Holders of Series B receive cash, securities or other property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange (for cash, securities or other property) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. 
 5.  Voting Rights. 
 (a)  General. The Holders of Series B shall not have any voting rights except as set forth below and as determined by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof or as otherwise  from time to time required by law. 
 (b)  Right to Elect Two Directors Upon Nonpayment Events. If and whenever dividends on any shares of the Series B, or any other Voting Preferred Stock, shall have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more Dividend Per iods, whether or not for consecutive Dividend Periods (a " Nonpayment"), the holders of such shares, voting together as a class with holders of any and all other series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding, will be entitled to vote for the ele ction of a total of two additional members of the Board of Directors (the " Preferred Stock Directors ");  provided that the election of any such directors shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors; and  provided further that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors. In that event, the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically increase by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series B or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting. Such request to call a special meeting for the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors after a Nonpayment shall be made by written notice, signed by the requisite holders of Series B or other Voting Preferred Stock, and delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation in such manner as provided for in Section 16 below, or as may otherwise be required by law. The voting rights will continue until 
   
 -5- 
 
 
dividends on the shares of the Series B and any such series of Voting Preferred Stock shall have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of such dividends shall have been set aside for such payment) for at least four regular dividend periods following the Nonpayment. 
If and when dividends for at least four regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for such payment shall have been set aside) on the Series B and any other class or series of Voting Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series B and all other holders of Voting Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each subsequent Nonpayment), the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically decrease by two. In determining whether dividends have been paid for at least four regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment, the Corporation may take account of any dividend it elects to pay for any dividend period after the regular dividend date for that period has passed. 
Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series B together with all series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting together as a single class) to the extent such holders have the voting rights described above. So long as a Nonpayment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the initial election after a Nonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series B and all Voting Preferred Stock wh en they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a single class);  provided that the filling of each vacancy shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors. Any such vote to remove, or to fill a vacancy in the office of, a Preferred Stock Director may be taken only at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series B or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders). The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 The term " Voting Preferred Stock" means any other class or series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation ranking equally with the Series B as to payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable. Voting Preferred Stock includes the Corporation's Floating  Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A (the " Series A "), and the Corporation's 10% Series C Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Preferred Stock (the " Series C"), in each case, if outstanding, and any class or series of Preferred Stock, whether or not cumulative, that the Corporation may issue in the future, to the extent their like voting rights are exercisable at such time. Whether a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series B and any other Voting Preferred Stock have been voted in favor of any matter shall be determined by reference to the relative liquidation preferences of the shares voted. 
   
 -6- 
 
 
 (c)  Other Voting Rights. So long as any shares of Series B are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Series B and any Voting Preferred Stock at the time outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating: 
 (i)  Authorization of Senior Stock. Any amendment or alteration of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designations to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking senior to the Series B with respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon any liqui dation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; 
 (ii)  Amendment of Series B. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designations, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series B, taken as a whole; or

(A) The exact Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices and Effective Dates may not be set forth in the table above, in which case: 
(1) if the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price is between two Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price amounts in the table or the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date is between two dates in the table, the number of Make-Whole Shares will be determined by straight-line interpolation between the number of Make-Whole Shares set forth for the higher and lower Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price amounts and the two Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day year; 
(2) if the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price is in excess of $100.00 per share (subject to adjustment pursuant hereto), no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the  Series B; and 
(3) if the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price is less than $21.375 per share (subject to adjustment pursuant hereto), no Make-Whole Shares will be issued upon conversion of the Ser ies B. 
(B) The Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices set forth in the table above (and the corresponding prices set forth in clauses (2) and (3) above) are subject to adjustment pursuant hereto and shall be adjusted as of any date the Conversion Rate is adjusted. The adjusted Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices (and corresponding prices set forth in clauses (2) and (3) above) shall equal the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Prices (and corresponding prices set forth in clauses (2) and (3) above), respectively, applicable immediately prior to such 
   
 -19- 
 
 
adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Make-Whole Acquisition Stock Price adjustments and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. The number of Make-Whole Shares in the table above shall also be subject to adjustment in the same manner a s the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 11. 
(iii) On or before the twentieth day prior to the date on which the Corporation anticipates consummating the Make-Whole Acquisition (or, if later, within two Business Days after the Corporation becomes aware of a Make-Whole Acquisition described in clause (i) of the definition of such term), a written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the Corporation, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders as they appear in the records of the Corporation. Such notice shall contain: 
 (A) the date on which the Make-Whole Acquisition is anticipated to be effected; 
(B) the date, which shall be 30 days after the Make-Whole Acquisition Effective Date, by which the Make-Whole Acquisition conversion option must be exercised; 
(C) the amount of cash, securities and other consideration payable per share of Common Stock or Series B, respectively; and 
(D) the instructions a Holder must follow to exercise its conversion option in connection with such Make-Whole Acquisition. 
(iv) To exercise a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option, a Holder must, no later than the Close of Business on the date by which the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option must be exercised as specified in the notice delivered under Section 10(c)(iii), comply with the procedures set forth in Section 10(b). 
(v) If a Holder does not elect to exercise the Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion option pursuant to this Section 10(c), the shares of Series B or successor securities held by it sh all remain outstanding but shall not be eligible to receive Make-Whole Shares. 
(vi) Upon a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion, the Conversion Agent shall, except as otherwise provided in the instructions provided by the Holder thereof in the written notice provided to the Corporation or its successor as set forth in Section 10(b), deliver to the Holder such cash, securities or other property as are issuable with respect to Make-Whole Sh ares in the Make-Whole Acquisition. 
(vii) In the event that a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion is effected with respect to shares of Series B or successor securities representing fewer than all the shares of Series  B or successor securities held by a Holder, upon such Make-Whole Acquisition 
   
 -20- 
 
 
Conversion, the Corporation or its successor shall execute and the Conversion Agent shall, unless otherwise instructed in writing, countersign and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Corporation or its successors, a certificate evidencing the shares of Series B or such successor securities held by the Holder as to which a Make-Whole Acquisit ion Conversion was not effected. 
(viii) If a Holder elects to convert its shares of Series B in connection with a Make-Whole Acquisition, such Holder shall not be entitled to an adjusted conversion price pursuant  to Section 10(g) to the extent such Make-Whole Acquisition also constitutes a Fundamental Change. 
 (d)  Registration of Common Stock. In the event that a Holder shall not by written notice designate the name in which shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of such Series B should be registered or the address to which the certificate or certificates representing such shares of Common Stock should be sent, the Corporation shall be entitled to register such shares, and make such payment, in the name of the Holder as shown on the records of the Corporation and to send the certificate or certificates representing such shares of Common Stock to the address o f such Holder shown on the records of the Corporation. 
 (e)  Dividends. If a Non-Mandatory Conversion Date on which a Holder elects to convert Series B is prior to the Close of Business on the Dividend Record Date relating to any declared dividend for the Dividend Period in which such Holder is electing to convert, such Holder will not have the right to receive any declared dividends for that Dividend Period. If a Non-Mandatory Conversion Date on which a Holder elects to convert Series B is after the Close of Business on the Dividend Record Date for any declared dividend and prior to the Dividend Payment Date, such Holder shall receive that dividend on the relevant Dividend Payment Date if such Holder was the Holder of record at the Close of Business on the Dividend Record Date for that dividend. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the Non-Mandatory Conversion Date is after the Close of Business on the Dividend Record Date and prior to the Open of Business on the Dividend Payment Date, whether or not such Holder was the Holder of record at the Close of Business on the Dividend Record Date, the Holder must pay to the Conversion Agent upon conversion of the shares of Series B an amount in cash equal to the dividend payable on the Dividend Payment Date for the then-current Dividend Period on the shares of  Series B being converted. 
 (f)  Outstanding Shares of Series B. Shares of Series B shall cease to be outstanding on the applicable Conversion Date, subject to the right of Holders of such shares to receive shares of Common Stock issuable upon  conversion of such shares of Series B. 
 (g)  Conversion Upon Fundamental Change. 
(i) If the Reference Price in connection with a Fundamental Change is less than the then applicable Conversion Price, a Holder may convert each share of Series B during the period beginning on the effective date of the Fundamental Change and ending on the date that is 30 days after the effective date of such Fundamental Change at an adjusted conversion price  equal to the greater of (1) the Reference Price and (2) $12.6250, 
   
 -21- 
 
 
 subject to adjustment as described herein (the " Base Price "),  provided that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, prior to the receipt of Stockholder Approval, any conversion in connection with a Fundamental Change shall be limited to conversion into such number of shares of Common Stock so that such conversion would not result in a Violation. The date of such conversion upon a Fundamental Change is referred to her ein as the " Fundamental Change Conversion Date ." 
(ii) The Base Price shall be adjusted as of any date the Conversion Rate of the Series B is adjusted pursuant hereto. The adjusted Base Price shall equal the Base Price applicable immediately prior to such adjustment multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Base Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate as so adjusted. If the Reference Price is less than the Base Price, Holders shall receive a maximum of 79.2079 shares of Common Stock per share of Series B (subject to adjustment in a manner inverse to the adjustments to the Base Price). 
 (iii) On or before the 20 th day prior to the date on which the Corporation anticipates consummating the Fundamental Change (or, if later, within two Business Days after the Corporation becomes aware of a Fundamental Change described in clause (i) of the definition of such term), a written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the Corporation, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to  the Holders as they appear in the records of the Corporation. Such notice shall contain: 
 (A) the date on which the Fundamental Change is anticipated to be effected; and 
(B) the date, which shall be 30 days after the effective date of a Fundamental Change, by which the Fundamental Change conversion option must be exercised. 
(iv) On the effective date of a Fundamental Change, another written notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the Corporation, by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders as  they appear in the records of the Corporation. Such notice shall contain: 
 (A) the date that shall be 30 days after the effective date of the Fundamental Change; 
 (B) the adjusted conversion price following the Fundamental Change; 
(C) the amount of cash, securities and other consideration payable per share of Common Stock or Series B, respectively; and 
(D) the instructions a Holder must follow to exercise its conversion option in connection with such Fundamental Change. 
   
 -22- 
 
 
(v) To exercise its conversion option upon a Fundamental Change, a Holder must, no later than the Close of Business on the date by which the conversion option upon the Fundamental Change must be exercised as specified in the notice delivered under Section 10(g)(iv), comply with the procedures set forth in Section 10(b). 
(vi) If a Holder does not elect to exercise its conversion option upon a Fundamental Change pursuant to this Section 10(g), the shares of Series B or successor securities held by it will remain outstanding but shall not thereafter be entitled to convert in accordance with Section 10(g). 
(vii) Upon a conversion upon a Fundamental Change, the Conversion Agent shall, except as otherwise provided in the instructions provided by the Holder thereof in the written notice provided to the Corporation or its successor as set forth in Section 10(b), deliver to the Holder such cash, securities or other property as are issuable with respect to the adjus ted conversion price following the Fundamental Change. 
(viii) In the event that a conversion upon a Fundamental Change is effected with respect to shares of Series B or successor securities representing fewer than all the shares of Series B or successor securities held by a Holder, upon such conversion the Corporation or its successor shall execute and the Conversion Agent shall, unless otherwise instructed in writing, countersign and deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Corporation, a certificate evidencing the shares of Series B or such successor securities held by the H older as to which a conversion upon a Fundamental Change was not effected. 
(ix) If a Holder elects to convert its shares of Series B in connection with a Fundamental Change, such Holder shall not be entitled to Make-Whole Shares pursuant to Section 10(c)  to the extent such Fundamental Change also constitutes a Make-Whole Acquisition. 
(h) A Holder cannot effect both a Make-Whole Acquisition Conversion and a Fundamental Change Conversion with respect to a share of Series B. 
(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Certificate of Designations, a Holder of shares of Series B shall not, for a period of 35 calendar days after any Conversion Date, sell any shares of Common Stock or other equity securities it receives upon conversion of the shares it converted on such Conversion Date. 
 11.  Anti-Dilution Adjustments. 
   
 -23- 
 
 
 (a) The Conversion Rate shall be adjusted from time to time by the Corporation as follows: 
(i) If the Corporation, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series B is outstanding, issues shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of Common Stock, or if the Corporation effects a share split or share combination in respect of the Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula: 
   
 
 CR 1 
   =   CR 0   Ã—     OS 1         OS 0 
 where 
   
 
 
 CR 0 
    =   the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or the Close of Business on the effective date of suc h share split or combination, as applicable; 
 CR 1 
    =   the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or the Close of Business on the effective date of su ch share split or share combination, as applicable; 
 OS 0 
    =   the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or the Close of Business on the ef fective date of such share split or share combination, as applicable; and 
 OS 1 
    =   the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution, or the Close of Business on the effective date of such share split or share combin ation, as applicable. 
 
The Corporation will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in treasury by the Corporation. 
(ii) Except as otherwise provided for by Section 11(a)(iv) below, if the Corporation, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series B is outstanding, distributes to all or substantially all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock any rights or warrants entitling them for a period of not more than 45 calendar days from the Record Date of such distribution to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Record Date of such distribution, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula: 
   
 
 CR 1 
   =   CR 0   Ã—     OS 0  + X         OS 0  + Y 
   
 -24- 
 
 
 where 
   
 CR 0   =   the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution; CR 1   =   the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution; OS 0   =   the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution; X   =    the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights or warrants; and Y   =   the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights or warrants divided by the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution. 
To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered pursuant to such rights or warrants upon the expiration or termination of such rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the distribution of such rights or warrants been made on the basis of the deli very of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. 
In determining the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights or warrants, there shall be taken into account any amount payable on exercise thereof, with the value of such consideration, if other than Cash, to be determined in good faith by the Corporation's Board of Directors. 
   
 -25- 
 
 
(iii) If the Corporation, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series B is outstanding, shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock shares of any class of Capital Stock of the Corporation (other than Common Stock as covered by Section 11(a)(i) above), evidences of its indebtedness, assets, property or rights or warrants to acquire the Corporation's Capital Stock or other securities, but excluding (1) dividends or distributions as to which an adjustment under Section 11(a)(i), Section 11(a)(ii) or Section 11(a)(iv) hereof shall apply, (2) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in Cash and (3) Spin-Offs to which the provision set forth below in this Section 11(a)(iii) shall apply (any of such shares of Capital Stock, indebtedness, assets, property or rights or warrants to acquire the Corporation's Common Stock or oth er securities, hereinafter in this Section 11(a)(iii) called the " Distributed Property "), then, in each such case the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula: 
   
   CR 1  = CR 0  Ã—    SP 0        SP 0  - FMV    
 where 
   
 CR 0   =   the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution; CR 1   =   the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution; SP 0   =   the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such dist ribution; and FMV   =   the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Corporation's Board of Directors) of the portion of Distributed Property with respect to each outstanding share of Common  Stock on the Record Date for such distribution. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of the Distributed Property so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is  equal to or greater than SP 0 as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, the Corporation shall distribute to each Holder on the date the Distributed Property is distributed to holders of Common Stock, but without requiring such Holder to convert its shares of Series B, the amount of Distributed Property such Holder would have received had such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the record date fixed for determination for stockholders entitled to receive such distribution. If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it shall in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the average of the Closing Prices of the Common Stock for purposes of calculating SP 0  in the formula in this Section 11(a)(iii). 
   
 -26- 
 
 
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 11(a)(iii) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock consisting of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Corporation (a " Spin-Off"), the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the Close of Business on the tenth Trading Day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off shall b e increased based on the following formula: 
   
   CR 1  = CR 0  Ã—    FMV + MP 0        MP 0    
 where 
   
 CR 0   =    the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business on the 10 th  Trading Day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off; CR 1   =    the new Conversion Rate in effect from and after the Close of Business on the 10 th  Trading Day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off; FMV   =   the average of the Closing Prices of the Capital Stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of Common Stock applicable to one share of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off; and MP 0   =   the average of the Closing Prices of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off. 
 Such adjustment shall occur on the 10 th Trading Day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off (it being agreed that notwithstanding Section 10(a), the Holder of the Series B shall not be e ntitled to convert the Series B pursuant to an Early Conversion prior to such 10 th  Trading Day). 
For purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii), Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii) hereof, any dividend or distribution to which this Section 11(a)(iii) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock, or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock to which Section 11(a)(i) or 11(a)(ii) hereof applies (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets or shares of Capital Stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants to which Section 11(a)(i) or 11(a)(ii) hereof applies (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 11(a)(iii) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such rights or warrants to which Section 11(a)(i) or 11(a)(ii) hereof applies (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 11(a)(i) and 11(a)(ii) hereof with respect to such dividend or distribution 
   
 -27- 
 
 
shall then be made), except (A) the Close of Business on the Record Date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted for "the Close of Business on the Record Date," "the Close of Business on the Record Date or the Close of Business on the effective date," "after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution or the Close of Business on the effective date of such share split or share combination" and "the Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution" within the meaning of Section 11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii) hereof and (B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date or the Close of Business on the effective date" within the meaning of Section 11(a)(i) hereof. 
(iv) If the Corporation, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series B is outstanding, distributes rights or warrants to all holders of Common Stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for, purchase or convert into shares of the Corporation's Capital Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which rights or warrants, until  the occurrence of a specified event or events (" Trigger Event"): (x) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (y) are not exercisable; and (z) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of Section 11(a)(iii) above, (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under Section 11(a)(iii) above will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event and a distribution or deemed distribution under the terms of such rights or warrants at which time an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made in the same manner as provided for under Section 11(a)(iii) above. If any such rights or warrants are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Record Date with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 11(a)(iv) was made, (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a Cash distribution, equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such rights or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such rights or warrants had not been issued. 
   
 -28- 
 
 
(v) (1) If the Corporation, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series B is outstanding, makes a regular, quarterly Cash dividend or distribution to all or substantia lly all holders of Common Stock during any quarterly fiscal period that exceeds $0.27 (the " Initial Dividend Threshold "), the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula: 
   
   CR 1  = CR 0  Ã—    SP 0        SP 0  - C    
 where 
   
 CR 0   =   the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution; CR 1   =   the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution; SP 0   =   the average Closing Price of the Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Days ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distri bution; C   =   the amount in Cash per share the Corporation distributes or dividends to holders of Common Stock in excess of the Initial Dividend Threshold. 
The Initial Dividend Threshold shall be adjusted in a manner inversely proportional to adjustments to the Conversion Rate;  provided that no adjustment shall be made to the Initial Dividend Threshold for any adjustment made to the Conversion Rate pursuant to clauses (1) or (2) of this Section 11(a)(v). 
(2) If the Corporation pays any cash dividend or distribution that is not a regular, quarterly cash dividend or distribution to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, th e Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula: 
   
   CR 1  = CR 0  Ã—    SP 0        SP 0  - C    
 where 
   
 CR 0   =   the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution; 
   
 -29- 
 
 
 CR 1   =   the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution; SP 0   =   the average Closing Price of the Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Days ending on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distri bution; C   =    the amount in Cash per share the Corporation distributes or dividends to holders of Common Stock 
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the portion of the Cash so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than SP 0 as set forth above, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, the Corporation shall distribute to each Holder on the date the Cash dividend or distribution is paid to holders of Common Stock, but without requiring such Holder to convert its shares of Series B, the amount of Cash such Holder would have received had such Holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution. If such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared. 
(4) For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section 11(a)(v), in the event of any reclassification of the Common Stock, as a result of which the Series B becomes convertible into more than one class of Common Stock, if an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required pursuant to this Section 11(a)(v), references in this Section to one share of Common Stock or Closing Price of one share of Common Stock shall be deemed to refer to a unit or to the price of a unit consisting of the number of shares of each class of Common Stock into which the Series B is then convertible equal to the numbers of shares of such class issued in respect of one share of Common Stock in such reclassification. The above provisio ns of this paragraph shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications. 
(vi) If the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment of Cash or other consideration in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for all or any portion of the Common Stock, where such Cash and the value of any such other consideration included in the payment per share of Common Stock validly tendered or exchanged exceeds the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the last date (the "expiration date") on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it  may be amended), the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula: 
   
   CR 1  = CR 0  Ã—    AC + (SP 1 Ã—OS 1 )        OS 0  Ã— SP 1    
   
 -30- 
 
 
 where 
   
 CR 0   =    the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business on the expiration date; CR 1   =    the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on the expiration date; AC   =   the aggregate value of all Cash and any other consideration (as determined in good faith by the Corporation's Board of Directors) paid or payable for shares purchased in such tende r or exchange offer; OS 0   =   the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the date such tender or exchange offer expires; OS 1   =   the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the date such tender or exchange offer expires (after giving effect to such tender offer or exchange offer); and SP 1   =   the average Closing Price of Common Stock over the ten consecutive Trading Days ending on the Trading Day next succeeding the expiration date. 
If the Corporation or a Subsidiary is obligated to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any such tender or exchange offer, but the Corporation or such Subsidiary is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all or any portion of such purchases are rescinded, then the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made or had only been made in respect of the purchases that had been effected. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, if an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to this Section 11(a)(vi) with respect to any tender offer or exchange offer would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender offer or exchange offer under this Section 11(a)(vi). 
(vii) For purposes of this Section 11(a) the term "Record Date" shall mean, with respect to any dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in which the holders of Common Stock have the right to receive any Cash, securities or other property or in which the Common Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any combination of Cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such Cash, securities or other property (whether such date is fixed by  the Board of Directors or by statute, contract or otherwise). 
   
 -31- 
 
 
(viii) If application of the formulas provided in Sections 11(a)(i), 11(a)(ii), 11(a)(iii), 11(a)(iv), 11(a)(v) or 11(a)(vi) above would result in a decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment (other than a readjustment as described in such sections) to the Conversion Rate shall be made except in the case of a share split or combination of the Common Stoc k. 
(ix) If one or more events occur requiring an adjustment be made to the Conversion Rate for a particular period, adjustments to the Conversion Rate shall be determined by the Corporation's Board of Directors to reflect the combined impact of such Conversion Rate adjustments, as set out in this Section 11(a), during such period. 
(x) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing clauses in this Section 11, no adjustment in the Conversion Rate shall be required unless the adjustment would result in a change in the Co nversion Rate of at least 1.00%;  provided, however, that any adjustment which by reason of this Section 11(a)(x) is not required to be made shall be carried forward and the Corporation shall make such adjustment, regardless of whether the aggregate adjustment is less than 1.00%, within one year of the first such adjustment carried forward or in connection with any conversion of Series B. All calculations under this Section 11 shall be made to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a cent or to the nearest one-ten thousandth (1/10,000) of a share, as the case may be. 
No adjustment in the Conversion Rate need be made (i) for issuances of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan for reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Corporation's securities or the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan, (ii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase shares pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of, or assumed by, the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible security outstanding as of the date the Series B was first issued, (iv) for a change in the par value of the Common Stock, (v) for repurchases of shares of Common Stock in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions, or (vi) for accumulated and unpaid dividends, other than as expressly contemplated by Section 11(a)(i). 
No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made pursuant to Section 11(a)(i) through (ix) above for a transaction if Holders are permitted to participate in the transaction without conversion, concurrently with the holders of Common Stock, on a basis and with notice that the Board of Directors of the Corporation determines in good faith to be fair and appropriate in light of the basis and notice to holders of Common Stock participating in the transaction. 
Whenever a provision of this Certificate of Designations requires the calculation of an average of the Closing Price over a span of multiple days, the Corporation will make appropriate adjustments to account for any adjustment to the Conversion Rate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the Conversion Rate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the Conversion Rate where the Ex-Dividend Date of the event occurs, at any time during the period from which the average is to be calculated.

(xi) Upon conversion of the Series B, the Holders shall receive, in addition to any shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, any associated rights issued under any shareholder rights agreement of the Corporation that provides that each share of Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Series B at any time prior to the distribution of separate certificates representing such rights will be entitled to receive such rights unless, prior to conversion, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, expired, terminated or been redeemed or exchanged in accordance with such rights plan, and no adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 11(a)(iv) hereof. If, prior to any conversion, the rights have separated from the Common Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted at the time of separation as if the Corporation distributed to all holders of Common Stock, shares of Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets, property or rights or warrants as described in Section 11(a)(iv) hereof, subject to readjustment in the event of the  expiration, termination or redemption of such rights. 
(xii) Subject to applicable stock exchange rules and listing standards, the Corporation shall be entitled to increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for a period of at least 20 Business Days if the Board of Directors determines that such increase would be in the best interests in the Corporation;  provided the Corporation has given to the Conversion Agent and DTC at least 15 days' prior notice of any such increase in the Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect. Subject to applicable stock exchange rules and listing standards, the Corporation shall be entitled to increase the Conversion Rate, in addition to the events requiring an increase in the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 11 hereof, as it in its discretion shall determine to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any tax to shareholders in connection with any stock dividends, subdivisions of shares, distributions of rights to purchase stock or securities or distributions of securities convertible into or exchangeable for sto ck hereafter made by the Corporation to its shareholders or other events. 
(xiii) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the Corporation will issue a notice to the Conversion Agent and DTC containing the relevant information and make this information available on the Corporation's website. In addition, the Corporation shall provide upon the request of a Holder of Series B, to the extent not posted on the Corporation website, a brief statement setting forth in reasonable detail how the adjustment to the Conversion Rate was determined and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate. 
(xiv) For purposes of this Section 11, the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Corporation but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. 
(xv) If the record date for a dividend or distribution on Common Stock occurs prior to a Mandatory Conversion Date and the payment date for a dividend or distribution on Common Stock occurs after a Mandatory Conversion Date, and such dividend or distribution would have resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate if such dividend or distribution does not result in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate but were paid prior to such Mandatory Conversion Date, then without duplication the Corporation shall deem the Holders to be holders 
   
 -33- 
 
 
of record of Common Stock for purposes of that dividend or distribution. In that case, the Holders will receive the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the applicable Mandatory Conversion Date together with the dividend or distribution on such shares of Common Stock so converted. 
 12.  Reorganization Events. 
 (a) In the event of: 
(i) any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another Person or of another Person with or into the Corporation; 
(ii) any sale, transfer, lease or conveyance to another Person of the property of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety; 
(iii) any statutory share exchange of the Corporation with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition); or 
 (iv) any liquidation, dissolution or termination of the Corporation; 
in each case in which holders of Common Stock would be entitled to receive cash, securities or other property for their shares of Common Stock (any such event specified in this Sec tion 12(a), a " Reorganization Event"), each share of Series B outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization Event shall, without the consent of Holders, become convertible into the kind of cash, securities and other property receivable in such Reorganization Event by a holder of one share of Common Stock that was not the counterparty to the Reorganization Event or an affiliate of such  other party (such cash, securities and other property, the " Exchange Property "). 
(b) In the event that holders of the shares of the Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, the "Exchange Property" that Holders of the Series B will be entitled to receive shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration received by the holders of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election (or of all such holders if none make an election). The number of units of Exchange Property for each share of Series B converted following the effective date of such Reorganization Event shall be determined based on the Conversion Rate then in effect on the applicable Conversion Date, determined as if the references to a  "share of Common Stock" in this Certificate of Designations were to "unit of Exchange Property." 
(c) After a Reorganization Event, for purposes of determining whether a Mandatory Conversion Date has occurred, the term "Closing Price" shall be deemed to refer to the closing sale price, last quoted bid price or mid-point of the last bid and ask prices, as the case may be, of any publicly traded securities that comprise all or part of the Exchange Property. For purposes of this Section 12, references to Common Stock in the definition of "Trading Day" shall be replaced by references to any publicly traded securities that comprise all  or part of the Exchange Property. 
   
 -34- 
 
 
(d) The above provisions of this Section 12 shall similarly apply to successive Reorganization Events and the provisions of Section 11 shall apply to any shares of capital stock of the Corporation (or any successor) received by the holders of the Common Stock in any such Reorganization Event. 
(e) The Corporation (or any successor) shall, within 20 days of the occurrence of any Reorganization Event, provide written notice to the Holders of such occurrence of such event and of the kind and amount of the cash, securities or other property that constitutes the Exchange Property. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect the operation of this Se ction 12 or the validity of any Reorganization Event. 
 13.  Fractional Shares. 
(a) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued as a result of any conversion of shares of Series B. 
(b) In lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock otherwise issuable in respect of any mandatory conversion pursuant to Section 10(a) or a conversion at the option of the Holder pursuant to Section 9, Section 10(c) or Section 10(g), the Corporation shall pay an amount in cash (computed to the nearest cent) equal to the same fraction of: 
(i) in the case of a mandatory conversion pursuant to Section 10(a), a Make Whole Acquisition conversion pursuant to Section 10(c) or a Conversion Upon Fundamental Change pursuant to Section 10(g), the average of the Closing Prices over the five consecutive Trading Day period preceding the Trading Day immediately preceding the applicable Conversion Date; or 
(ii) in the case of an Early Conversion pursuant to Section 9, the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the second Trading Day immediately preceding the Early Conversion Date. 
(c) If more than one share of the Series B is surrendered for conversion at one time by or for the same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of the Series B so surrendered. 
 14.  Reservation of Common Stock. 
(a) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock or shares held in the treasury by the Corporation, solely for issuance upon the conversion of shares of Series B as provided in this Certificate of Designations, free from any preemptive or other similar rights, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be issuable upon the conversion of all the shares of Series B then outstanding. For purposes of this Section 14(a), the number of shares of Common Stock that shall be deliverable upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series B shall be computed as if at the time of computation all such outstanding shares were held by  a single Holder. 
   
 -35- 
 
 
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall be entitled to deliver upon conversion of shares of Series B, as herein provided, shares of Common Stock acquired by the Corporation (in lieu of the issuance of authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock), so long as any such acquired shares are free and clear of all liens, charges, security interests or encumbrances (other than liens, charges, security interests and other encumbrances created by the Holders). 
(c) All shares of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the Series B shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, free and clear of all liens, claims, security interests and other encumbrances (other than liens, charges, security interests and other encumbrances created by the Holders). 
(d) Prior to the delivery of any securities that the Corporation shall be obligated to deliver upon conversion of the Series B, the Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all federal and state laws and regulations thereunder requiring the registration of such securities with, or any approval of or consent to the delivery thereof by,  any governmental authority. 
(e) The Corporation hereby covenants and agrees that, if at any time the Common Stock shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange or automated quotation system, the Corporation will, if permitted by the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system, list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or automated quotation system, all the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B;  provided, however, that if the rules of such exchange or automated quotation system permit the Corporation to defer the listing of such Common Stock until the first conversion of Series B into Common Stock in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Corporation covenants to list such Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B in accordance with the requirements  of such exchange or automated quotation system at such time. 
 15.  Record Holders. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation and the transfer agent for the Series B may deem and treat the record holder of any share of Series B as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the Corporation nor such transfer agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. 
 16.  Notices. All notices or communications in respect of Series B shall be sufficiently given if given in writing and delivered in person or by first class mail, postage prepaid, or if given in such other manner as may be permitted in this Certificate of Designations, in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or by applicable law. 
 17.  Preemptive or Subscription Rights. Except as expressly provided in any agreement between a Holder and the Corporation, no share of Series B shall have any rights of preemption whatsoever as to any securities of the Corporation, or any warrants, rights or options issued or granted with respect thereto, regardless of how such securities, or such warrants, rights or options, may be designated,  issued or granted. 
   
 -36- 
 
 
 18.  Repurchase. Subject to the limitations imposed herein, the Corporation may purchase and sell shares of Series B from time to time to such extent, in such manner, and upon such terms as the Bo ard or any duly authorized committee of the Board may determine;  provided, however, that the Corporation shall not use any of its funds for any such purchase when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Corporation is, or by such purchase would be, rend ered insolvent. 
 19.  Other Rights. The shares of Series B shall not have any voting powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other special rights, or qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, other than as set forth herein or in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation or as provided by applicable law.

 CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS OF PREFERENCES AND RIGHTS 
 OF THE 
 10% SERIES C NON-CUMULATIVE NON-VOTING PERPETUAL 
 PREFERRED STOCK 
 ($1,000 LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE PER SHARE) 
 OF 
 MORGAN STANLEY 
 Pursuant to Section 151 of the 
 General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware 
 MORGAN STANLEY, a Delaware corporation (the " Corporation"), DOES HEREBY CERTIFY that, pursuant to resolutions of the Preferred Stock Financing Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation adopted on October 12, 2008, the creation of 10% Series C Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, liquidation preference $1,000 per share (" Series C"), of the Corporation was authorized and the designation, preferences, privileges, voting rights, and other special rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the Series C, in addition to those set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Corporation, are fixed as follows: 
 1.  Designation. The distinctive serial designation of such series of preferred stock is "10% Series C Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Preferred Stock." Each share of Series C shall be identical in all respects to every other share of Series C, except as to the respective dates from which dividends thereon shall accrue, to the extent such dates may differ as permitted  pursuant to Section 3 below. 
 2.  Number of Shares. The authorized number of shares of Series C shall be 1,160,791. Shares of Series C that are purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall be cancelled and shall revert to authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock provided that this Section 2 shall not apply to any purchase or other acquisition of shares of Series C by any Subsid iary of the Corporation. 
 3.  Dividends . 
 (a)  Rate. Holders of shares of Series C shall be entitled to receive, only when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof out of funds of the Corporation legally available for payment, non-cumulative cash dividends on the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share at a rate per annum equal to 10%. Declared dividends on the Series C shall be payable from and including the date of initial issuance (in the case of the initial Dividend Period) or the immediately preceding Dividend Payment Date (in the case of Dividend Periods other than the initial Dividend Period), and shall be payable quarterly, in arrears, on each January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15, commencing on Janua ry 15, 2009 (each such date a " Dividend Payment Date"). If any date on which dividends would otherwise be payable shall not be a Business Day (as defined below), then the date of payment of dividends 
 
 
need not be made on such date, but such payment of dividends may be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the Dividend Payment Date, and no additional dividends shall be payable nor shall interest accrue on the amount payable from and after such Dividend Payment Date to the next succeeding Busines s Day. " Business Day" means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday and that, in New York City, is not a day on which banking institutions generally are authorized or obligated by law or executive or der to be closed. 
Dividends on the Series C shall not be cumulative; Holders of Series C shall not be entitled to receive any dividends not declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof and no interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in respect of any dividend not so declared. Accordingly, if the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) does not declare a dividend on the Series C payable in respect of any Dividend Period before the related Dividend Payment Date, such dividend will not accrue and the Corporation will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that Dividend Period on that Dividend Payment Date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series C are declared for any future Dividend Period. Declared and unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. 
Dividends that are payable on the Series C on any Dividend Payment Date will be payable to holders of record of Series C as they appear on the stock register of the Corporation on  the applicable Dividend Record Date, which shall be the 15 th calendar day before such Dividend Payment Date or such other record date fixed by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors that is not more  than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such Dividend Payment Date (each, a " Dividend Record Date"). Any such day that is a Dividend Record Date shall be a Dividend Record Date whether or not such day is a Business Day. 
 The term " Dividend Period" means the period from and including each Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next succeeding Dividend Payment Date or any earlier redemption date (other than the initial Dividend Period, which shall commence on and include the date of initial issuance of the Series C and shall end on but exclude the next Dividend Payment Date). Dividends payable on  the Series C shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. 
 (b)  Priority of Dividends. The Series C will rank (i) senior to the Common Stock (as defined below) and any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be junior to the Series C, (ii) junior to any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be senior to the Series C (issued with the requisite consent of the Holders of the Series C, if required) and (iii) at least equally with each other class or series of Preferred Stock (as defined below) that the Corporation may issue with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. So long as any share of Series C remains outstanding, no dividend or distribution shall be paid or declared on Junior Stock, and no Junior Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly, during a Dividend Period, unless the full dividend for the latest completed Dividend Period on all outstanding 
   
 -2- 
 
 
shares of Series C has been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). The foregoing limitation shall not apply to (i) repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with (1) any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants or (2) a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan; (ii) an exchange, redemption, reclassification or conversion of any class or series of Junior Stock, or any junior stock of a Subsidiary of the Corporation, for any class or series of Junior Stock; (iii) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Stock under the conversion or exchange provisions of Junior Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; (iv) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any stockholders' rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any stockholders' rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of rights pursuant to the plan; or (v) any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equal or junior to that stock. In addition, the foregoing limitation shall not restrict  the ability of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, or any other affiliate of the Corporation, to engage in any market-making transactions in Junior Stock in the ordinary course of business. 
When dividends are not paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside) on any Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within a related Dividend Period) in full upon the Series C and any shares of Parity Stock, all dividends declared on the Series C and all such Parity Stock and payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within the related Dividend Period) shall be declared  pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the Series C and all Parity Stock payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within t he related Dividend Period) bear to each other. 
Subject to the foregoing, dividends (payable in cash, securities or other property) may be determined by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors and may be declared and paid on the Common Stock and any other stock ranking, as to dividends, equally with or junior to the Series C, from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the Series C shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividends. 
 4.  Liquidation Rights . 
 (a)  Voluntary or Involuntary Liquidation. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, Holders of Series C shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof available for distribution to stockholders of the Corporation, after satisfaction of all liabilities, if any, to creditors of the Corp oration and subject to the rights of holders of any shares of capital 
   
 -3- 
 
 
 stock of the Corporation then outstanding ranking senior to or  pari passu with the Series C in respect of distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, and before any distribution of such assets or proceeds is made to or set aside for the holders of Common Stock and any other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series C as to such distribution, a liquidating distribution in an amount equal to $1,000 per share, together with an amount equal to all dividends, if any, that have been declared but not paid prior to the date of payment of such distribution (but without any accumulation in respect of dividends that have not been declared prior to such payment date). Holders of the Series C will not be entitled to any o ther amounts from the Corporation after they have received their full liquidation preference. 
 (b)  Partial Payment. If in any distribution described in Section 4(a) above the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay the Liquidation Preference (as defined below) in full to all Holders of Series C and all holders of any stock of the Corporation ranking equally with the Series C as to such distribution, the amounts paid to the Holders of Serie s C and to the holders of all such other stock shall be paid  pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate Liquidation Preference of the Holders of Series C and the holders of all such other stock. In any such distribution, the " Liquidation Preference" of any holder of stock of the Corporation shall mean the amount otherwise payable to such holder in such distribution (assuming no limitation on the assets of the Corporation available for such distribution), including an amount equal to any declared but unpaid dividends (and, in the case of any holder of stock other than Series C and on which dividends accrue on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to any unpaid, accrued, cumulative dividends, whether or not declared, as applicable). Holders of the Series C will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received the full amounts provided for in this Section 4 and will have no right or claim to any of the Corporation's remaining  assets. 
 (c)  Residual Distributions. If the Liquidation Preference on the Series C and any other shares of the Corporation's stock ranking equally as to such liquidation distribution has been paid in full, the holders of other stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation (or proceeds thereof) according to their respective rights and preferences . 
 (d)  Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 4, the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the Holders of Series C receive cash, securities or other property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange (for cash, securities or other property) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. 
 5.  Voting Rights. 
 (a)  General. The Holders of Series C shall not have any voting rights except as set forth below and as determined by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof or as otherwise f rom time to time required by law. 
   
 -4- 
 
 
 (b)  Right to Elect Two Directors Upon Nonpayment Events. If and whenever dividends on any shares of the Series C, or any other Voting Preferred Stock, shall have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more Dividend Per iods, whether or not for consecutive Dividend Periods (a " Nonpayment"), the holders of such shares, voting together as a class with holders of any and all other series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding, will be entitled to vote for the ele ction of a total of two additional members of the Board of Directors (the " Preferred Stock Directors ");  provided that the election of any such directors shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors; and  provided further that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors. In that event, the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically increase by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series C or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting. Such request to call a special meeting for the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors after a Nonpayment shall be made by written notice, signed by the requisite holders of Series C or other Voting Preferred Stock, and delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation in such manner as provided for in Section 10 below, or as may otherwise be required by law. The voting rights will continue until dividends on the shares of the Series C and any such series of Voting Preferred Stock shall have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of such dividends shall have been  set aside for such payment) for at least four regular dividend periods following the Nonpayment. 
If and when dividends for at least four regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for such payment shall have been set aside) on the Series C and any other class or series of Voting Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series C and all other holders of Voting Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each subsequent Nonpayment), the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically decrease by two. In determining whether dividends have been paid for at least four regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment, the Corporation may take account of any dividend it elects to pay for any dividend period after the regular dividend date for that period has passed. 
Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series C together with all series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting together as a single class) to the extent such holders have the voting rights described above. So long as a Nonpayment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the initial election after a Nonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series C and all Voting Preferred Stock wh en they have the voting rights 
   
 -5- 
 
 
 described above (voting together as a single class);  provided that the filling of each vacancy shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors. Any such vote to remove, or to fill a vacancy in the office of, a Preferred Stock Director may be taken only at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series C or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders). The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 The term " Voting Preferred Stock" means any other class or series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation ranking equally with the Series C as to payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable. Voting Preferred Stock includes the Corporation's Floating  Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A (the " Series A ") and the Series B Non-Cumulative Non-Voting Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (the " Series B"), in each case, if outstanding, and any class or series of Preferred Stock, whether or not cumulative, that the Corporation may issue in the future, to the extent their like voting rights are exercisable at such time. Whether a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series C and any other Voting Preferred Stock have been voted in favor of any matter shall be determined by reference to the relative liquidation preferences of the shares voted. 
 (c)  Other Voting Rights. So long as any shares of Series C are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Series C and any Voting Preferred Stock at the time outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating: 
 (i)  Authorization of Senior Stock. Any amendment or alteration of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designations to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking senior to the Series C with respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon any liqui dation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; 
 (ii)  Amendment of Series C. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designations, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series C, taken as a whole; or 
 (iii)  Share Exchanges, Reclassifications, Mergers and Consolidations . Any consummation of a binding share exchange or 
   
 -6- 
 
 
reclassification involving the Series C, or of a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with another entity, unless in each case (x) the shares of Series C remain outstanding or are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (y) such shares remaining outstanding as securities of the Corporation or such other entity as permitted by clause (x) or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of th e Series C, taken as a whole; 
 provided ,  however, that for all purposes of this Section 5(c), the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking equally with the Series C with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation will not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of, and shall not require the affirmative vote or consent of, the holders of outstanding shares of Series C. For purposes of clarification, no Holder of Series C shall have any voting rights with respect to any binding share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation which complies with the provisions of clause (iii)(x) and (y) hereof. 
If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 5(c) for which a vote is otherwise required would adversely affect one or more but not all other series of Voting Preferred Stock (including the Series C for this purpose), then only such series of Preferred Stock as are adversely affected by and otherwise entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together as a class in lieu of all other series of Preferred Stock. If all series of a class of Preferred Stock that are otherwise entitled to vote on the matter are not equally affected by the proposed amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above, there shall be required a two-thirds approval of the class and a two-thirds approval of each series that will have a diminished status and that is otherwise  entitled to vote thereon. 
 (d)  Changes for Clarification. Without the consent of the holders of the Series C, so long as such action does not adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series C, the Corporation may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series C: 
(i) to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in this Certificate of Designations that may be defective or inconsistent; or 
(ii) to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series C that is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Certificate of Designation s.

 (e)  Changes after Provision for Redemption. No vote or consent of the holders of Series C shall be required pursuant to this Section 5 or otherwise if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which any such vote or consent would otherwise be required pursuant to such Section, all outstanding shares of Series C shall have been redeemed, or shall have been called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6. 
 (f)  Procedures for Voting and Consents. The rules and procedures for calling and conducting any meeting of the holders of Series C (including, without limitation, the fixing of a record date in connection therewith), the solicitation and use of proxies at such a meeting, the obtaining of written consents and any other aspect or matter with regard to such a meeting or such consents shall be governed by any rules the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may adopt from time to time, which rules and procedures shall conform to the requirements of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, applicable law and any national securities exchange or other trading facility on which the Series C is listed or traded at the time. Whether the vote or consent of the holders of a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series C and any Voting Preferred Stock has been cast or given on any matter on which the holders of shares of Series C are entitled to vote shall be determined by the Corporation by reference to the specified liquidation amounts  of the shares voted or covered by the consent. 
 6.  Redemption. 
 (a)  Optional Redemption. The Series C may not be redeemed by the Corporation prior to October 15, 2011. On or after October 15, 2011, subject to obtaining any then required regulatory approval, the Corporation, at its option, may redeem, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, the shares of Series C at the time outstanding, upon notice given as provided in Section 6(c) below, at a redemption price equal to $1,100 per share, together (except as otherwise provided herein below), for the purposes of the redemption price only, with an amount equal to dividends accumulated but unpaid for the then current Dividend Period at the rate set forth in Section 3 to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption (regardless of whether any dividends are actually declared for that Dividend Period). The redemption price for any shares of Series C shall be payable on the redemption date to the Holder of such shares against surrender of the certificate(s) evidencing such shares to the Corporation or its agent. Any accrued and unpaid dividend for the then current Dividend Period payable on a redemption date that occurs subsequent to the Dividend Record Date for a Dividend Period shall not be paid to the Holder entitled to receive the redemption price on the redemption date, but rather shall be paid to the Holder of record of the redeemed shares of Series C on such Dividend Record Date relating to the Dividend Payment Date as provided in Section 3 ab ove. 
 (b)  No Sinking Fund. The Series C will not be subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. Holders of Series C will have no right to require the redemption or repurc hase of any shares of Series C. 
   
 -8- 
 
 
 (c)  Notice of Redemption. Notice of every redemption of shares of Series C shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Holders of record of the shares of Series C to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Subsection shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any Holder of shares of Series C designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series C. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if depositary shares representing interests in the Series C are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company or any other similar facility, notice of redemption may be given to the Holders of Series C at such time and in any manner permitted by such facility. Each such notice given to a Holder shall state: (1) the redemption date; (2) the number of shares of Series C to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such Holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such Holder; (3) the redemption price; and (4) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to  be surrendered for payment of the redemption price. 
 (d)  Partial Redemption. In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series C at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected either  pro rata or in such other manner as the Corporation may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Corporation shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series C shall be redeemed from time to time. If fewer than all the shares of Series C represented by any certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares without charge to the holder thereof. 
 (e)  Effectiveness of Redemption. If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corp oration, separate and apart from its other funds, in trust for the  pro rata benefit of the Holders of any shares of Series C so called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date dividends shall cease to accrue on all shares so called for redemption, all shares of Series C so called for redemption shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the Holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption, without interest. Any funds unclaimed at the end of two years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released to the Corporation, after which time the Holders of the shares of Series C so called for redemption shall look only to t he Corporation for payment of the redemption price of such shares. 
 (f)  Regulatory. Redemption of the Series C by the Corporation is subject to its receipt of any required prior approvals from the Federal Reserve. The Corporation hereby confirms that it is the Corporation's intention that, at the time of any redemption of the Series C, the Corporation will repay the liquidation preference of any shares of Series C redeemed in 
   
 -9-

 7.  Rank.  Any stock of any class or classes or series of the Corporation shall be deemed to rank: 
(a) prior to shares of the Series C, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or both, if the holders of stock of such class or classes or series shall be entitled by the terms thereof to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be, in preference or priorit y to the Holders of shares of the Series C; 
(b) on a parity with shares of the Series C, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or both, whether or not the dividend rates, dividend payment dates, or redemption or liquidation prices per share thereof be different from those of the Series C, if the holders of stock of such class or classes or series shall be entitled by the terms thereof to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributed upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be, in proportion to their respective dividend rates or liquidation prices, without preference or priority of one over the other as between the holders of such stock and the Holders of shares of Series C (the term " Parity Preferred Stock" being used to refer to any stock on a parity with the shares of Series C, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or both, as the content may requi re); and 
(c) junior to shares of the Series C, either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or both, if such class or classes or series shall be common stock or if the Holders of the Series C shall be entitled to the receipt of dividends or of amounts distributable upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, as the case may be, in preferenc e or priority to the holders of stock of such class or classes or series.

" Share Dilution Amount" means the increase in the number of diluted shares outstanding (determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, and as measured from the date of the Corporation's consolidated financial statements most recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the Original Issue Date) resulting from the grant, vesting or exercise of equity-based compensation to employees and equitably adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split, reclassification or similar t ransaction.

If the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors determines not to pay any dividend or a full dividend on a Dividend Payment Date, the Corporation will provide written notice to the holders of Designated Preferred Stock p rior to such Dividend Payment Date. 
Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends (payable in cash, securities or other property) as may be determined by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors may be declared and paid on any securities, including Common Stock and other Junior Stock, from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and holders of Designated Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividends.

 (c)  Residual Distributions. If the Liquidation Preference has been paid in full to all holders of Designated Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable with respect of any other stock of the Corporation ranking equally with Designated Preferred Stock as to such distribution has been paid in full, the holders of other stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation (or proceeds thereof) according to their respective rights and preferences.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the first Dividend Payment Date falling on or after the third anniversary of the Original Issue Date, the Corporation, at its option, subject to the approval of the Appropriate Federal Banking Agency, may redeem, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, the shares of Designated Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, upon notice given as provided in Section 5(c) below, at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) the Liquidation Amount per share and (ii) except as otherwise provided below, any accrued and unpaid dividends (including, if applicable as provided in Section 3(a) above, dividends on such amount) (regardless of whether any dividends are actuall y declared) to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption;  providedthat (x) the Corporation (or any successor by Business Combination) has received aggregate gross proceeds of not less than the Minimum Amount (plus the "Minimum Amount" as defined in the relevant certificate of designations for each other outstanding series of preferred stock of such successor that was originally issued to the United States Department of the  Treasury (the " Successor Preferred Stock") in connection with the Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program) from one or more Qualified Equity Offerings (including Qualified Equity Offerings of such successor), and (y) the aggregate redemption price of the Designated Preferred Stock (and any Successor Preferred Stock) redeemed pursuant to this paragraph may not exceed the aggregate net cash proceeds received by the Corporation (or any successor by Business Combination) from such Qualified Equity Offerings (including Qualified Equity Offerings of such successor) . 
The redemption price for any shares of Designated Preferred Stock shall be payable on the redemption date to the holder of such shares against surrender of the certificate(s) evidencing such shares to the Corporation or its agent. Any declared but unpaid dividends payable on a redemption date that occurs subsequent to the Dividend Record Date for a Dividend Period shall not be paid to the holder entitled to receive the redemption price on the redemption date, but rather shall be paid to the holder of record of the redeemed shares on s uch Dividend Record Date relating to the Dividend Payment Date as provided in Section 3 above. 
 (b)  No Sinking Fund. The Designated Preferred Stock will not be subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. Holders of Designated Preferred Stock will have no right  to require redemption or repurchase of any shares of Designated Preferred Stock. 
 (c)  Notice of Redemption. Notice of every redemption of shares of Designated Preferred Stock shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Subsection shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Designated Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Designated Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if shares of Designated Preferred Stock are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Corporation or any other similar facility, notice of 
   
 A-6 
 
 
redemption may be given to the holders of Designated Preferred Stock at such time and in any manner permitted by such facility. Each notice of redemption given to a holder shall state: (1) the redemption date; (2) the number of shares of Designated Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (3) the redemption price; and (4) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of th e redemption price. 
 (d)  Partial Redemption. In case of any redemption of part of the shares of Designated Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected either  pro rata or in such other manner as the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof may determine to be fair and equitable. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Designated Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. If fewer than all the shares represented by any certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares without char ge to the holder thereof. 
 (e)  Effectiveness of Redemption. If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been deposited by the Corp oration, in trust for the  pro rata benefit of the holders of the shares called for redemption, with a bank or trust company doing business in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, and having a capital and surplus of at least $500 million and selected by the Board of Directors, so as to be and continue to be available solely therefor, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date dividends shall cease to accrue on all shares so called for redemption, all shares so called for redemption shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption from such bank or trust company, without interest. Any funds unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released to the Corporation, after which time the holders of the shares so called for redemption shall  look only to the Corporation for payment of the redemption price of such shares. 
 (f)  Status of Redeemed Shares. Shares of Designated Preferred Stock that are redeemed, repurchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall revert to authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock ( provided that any such cancelled shares of Designated Preferred Stock may be reissued only as shares of any series of Preferred Stock other than Designated Preferred Stock). 
 Section 6.  Conversion. Holders of Designated Preferred Stock shares shall have no right to exchange or convert such shares into any other securities. 
 Section 7.  Voting Rights .

 (b)  Preferred Stock Directors. Whenever, at any time or times, dividends payable on the shares of Designated Preferred Stock have not been paid for an aggregate of six quarterly Dividend Periods or more, whether or not consecutive, the authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall automatically be increased by two and the holders of the Designated Preferred Stock shall have the right, with holders of shares of any one or more other classes or series of Voting Parity Stock outstanding at the time, voting together as a class, to elect two directors (herei nafter the " Preferred Directors " and each a " Preferred Director") to fill such newly created directorships at the Corporation's next annual meeting of stockholders (or at a special meeting called for that purpose prior to such next annual meeting) and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders until all accrued and unpaid dividends for all past Dividend Periods, including the latest completed Dividend Period (including, if applicable as provided in Section 3(a) above, dividends on such amount), on all outstanding shares of Designated Preferred Stock have been declared and paid in full at which time such right shall terminate with respect to the Designated Preferred Stock, except as herein or by law expressly provided, subject to revesting in the event of each and ev ery subsequent default of the character above mentioned;  provided that it shall be a qualification for election for any Preferred Director that the election of such Preferred Director shall not cause the Corporation to violate any corporate governance requirements of any securities exchange or other trading facility on which securities of the Corporation may then be listed or traded that listed or traded companies must have a majority of independent directors. Upon any termination of the right of the holders of shares of Designated Preferred Stock and Voting Parity Stock as a class to vote for directors as provided above, the Preferred Directors shall cease to be qualified as directors, the term of office of all Preferred Directors then in office shall terminate immediately and the authorized number of directors shall be reduced by the number of Preferred Directors elected pursuant hereto. Any Preferred Director may be removed at any time, with or without cause, and any vacancy created thereby may be filled, only by the affirmative vote of the holders a majority of the shares of Designated Preferred Stock at the time outstanding voting separately as a class together with the holders of shares of Voting Parity Stock, to the extent the voting rights of such holders described above are then exercisable. If the office of any Preferred Director becomes vacant for any reason other than removal from office as aforesaid, the remaining Preferred Director may choose a successor who shall ho ld office for the unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred.

 (i)  Authorization of Senior Stock. Any amendment or alteration of the Certificate of Designations for the Designated Preferred Stock or the Charter to authorize or create or increase the authorized amount of, or any issuance of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of, any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking senior to Designated Preferred Stock with respect to either or both the payment of dividends and/or the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corp oration; 
   
 A-8 
 
 
 (ii)  Amendment of Designated Preferred Stock. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Certificate of Designations for the Designated Preferred Stock or the Charter (including, unless no vote on such merger or consolidation is required by Section 7(c)(iii) below, any amendment, alteration or repeal by means of a merger, consolidation or otherwise) so as to adversely affect the right s, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Designated Preferred Stock; or 
 (iii)  Share Exchanges, Reclassifications, Mergers and Consolidations. Any consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Designated Preferred Stock, or of a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with another corporation or other entity, unless in each case (x) the shares of Designated Preferred Stock remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (y) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of Designated Preferred Stock immediately prior to such consummation, taken as a whole; 
 provided ,  however, that for all purposes of this Section 7(c), any increase in the amount of the authorized Preferred Stock, including any increase in the authorized amount of Designated Preferred Stock necessary to satisfy preemptive or similar rights granted by the Corporation to other persons prior to the Signing Date, or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, whether pursuant to preemptive or similar rights or otherwise, of any other series of Preferred Stock, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any other series of Preferred Stock, ranking equally with and/or junior to Designated Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation will not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers, and shall not require the affirmative vote or consent of, the holders of outstanding shares of the Designated Preferred Stock. 
 (d)  Changes after Provision for Redemption. No vote or consent of the holders of Designated Preferred Stock shall be required pursuant to Section 7(c) above if, at or prior to the time when any such vote or consent would otherwise be required pursuant to such Section, all outstanding shares of the Designated Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed, or shall have been called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been deposited in trust for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 5 above. 
 (e)  Procedures for Voting and Consents. The rules and procedures for calling and conducting any meeting of the holders of Designated Preferred Stock (including, without limitation, the fixing of a record date in connection therewith), the solicitation and use of proxies at such a meeting, the obtaining of written consents and any other aspect or matter with regard to such a meeting or such consents shall be governed by any rules of the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may adopt from time to 
   
 A-9 
 
 
time, which rules and procedures shall conform to the requirements of the Charter, the Bylaws, and applicable law and the rules of any national securities exchange or other trading  facility on which Designated Preferred Stock is listed or traded at the time.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation and the transfer agent for Designated Preferred Stock may deem and treat the record holder of any share of Designated Preferred Stock as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the Corporation nor such transfer agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. 
 Section 9.  Notices.

 Section 10.  No Preemptive Rights. No share of Designated Preferred Stock shall have any rights of preemption whatsoever as to any securities of the Corporation, or any warrants, rights or options issued or granted with respect thereto, regardless of how such securities, or such warrants, rights or options, may be designated, issued or granted. 
 Section 11.  Replacement Certificates. The Corporation shall replace any mutilated certificate at the holder's expense upon surrender of that certificate to the Corporation.

 4.  Dividends . 
 (a)  Rate. Holders of Series E will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law, non-cumulative cash dividends from the Original Issue Date (in the case of the initial Dividend Period only) or the immediately preceding Dividend Payment Date, quarterly in arrears on each Dividend Payment Date, commencing on January 15, 2014. These dividends will accrue on the liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share at a rate per annum equal to 7.125% with respect to each Dividend Period from and including the Original Issue Date to, but excluding, October 15, 20 23 (the " Fixed Rate Period") and at a rate per annum equal to the three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR on the related Dividend Determination Date plus 4.32% with respect to each Dividend Period from and including  October 15, 2023 (the " Floating Rate Period"). In the event that the Corporation issues additional shares of Series E after the Original Issue Date, dividends on such shares may accrue from the Original Issue Date or any other date specified by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof at the time such additional shares are issued. 
Dividends that are payable on Series E on any Dividend Payment Date will be payable to holders of record of Series E as they appear on the stock register of the Corporation on the  applicable record date, which shall be the 15 th calendar day before such Dividend Payment Date or such other record date fixed by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors that is not more  than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such Dividend Payment Date (each, a " Dividend Record Date "). 
 A " Dividend Period" is the period from and including a Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next Dividend Payment Date or any earlier redemption date, except that (i) the initial Dividend Period for any share of Series E issued on the Original Issue Date will commence on and include the Original Issue Date of the Series E and will end on and exclude the January 15, 2014 Dividend Payment Date, and (ii) for any share of Series E issued after the Original Issue Date, the initial Dividend Period for such shares may commence on and include the Original Issue Date or such other date as the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors shall determine and publicly disclose and shall end on and exclude the next Dividend Payment Date. Dividends payable on the Series E for any Dividend Period during the Fixed Rate 
   
 3 
 
 
Period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dividends payable on the Series E for any Dividend Period during the Floating Rate Period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the Dividend Period. Dividends for the initial Dividend Period for shares of Series E issued on the Original Issue Date will be calculated from the Original Issue Date. If any scheduled Dividend Payment Date up to and including the October 15, 2023 scheduled Dividend Payment Date is not a Business Day, then the payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional dividends will accrue as a result of that postponement. If any scheduled Dividend Payment Date thereafter is not a Business Day, then the Dividend Payment Date will be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day unless such day falls in the next calendar month, in which case the Dividend Payment Date will be brought forward to the immediately preceding day that is a Business Day, and, in either case, dividends will a ccrue to, but excluding, the date dividends are paid. 
For any Dividend Period during the Floating Rate Period, LIBOR (the London interbank offered rate) shall be determined by the Calculation Agent on the Dividend Determination Date i n the following manner: 
(i) LIBOR will be the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of three months, commencing on the first day of such Dividend Period, that appears on Reuters screen page "LIBOR01", or any successor page, at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Dividend Determination Date. 
(ii) If no such rate appears, then the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market, selected by the Calculation Agent as directed by the Corporation, to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of three months, commencing on the first day of such Dividend Period, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Dividend Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR determined on that Dividend Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR will be determined for the first day of such Dividend Period as the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York time, on that Dividend Determination Date, by three major banks in New York City, selected by the Calculation Agent as directed by the Corporation, for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks, for a period of three months, commencing on the first day of such Dividend Period, and in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time. If the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, LIBOR for that Dividend Determination Date will be the same as LIBOR for the immediately preceding Dividend Period, or, if there was no such Dividend  Period, the dividend payable will be based on the initial dividend rate. 
The Calculation Agent's determination of any dividend rate, and its calculation of the amount of dividends for any Dividend Period, will be on file at the Corporation's principal offices, will be made available to any stockholder upon request and will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error. 
 " Reuters " means Reuters 3000 Xtra Service or any successor service. 
Holders of Series E shall not be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, securities or other property, other than dividends (if any) declared and payable on the Series E as specified in this Section 4 (subject to the other provisions of this Certificate of Designation). 
   
 4 
 
 
Dividends on shares of the Series E will not be cumulative. Accordingly, if the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) does not declare a dividend on the Series E payable in respect of any Dividend Period before the related Dividend Payment Date, such dividend will not accrue and the Corporation will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that Dividend Period on the Dividend Payment Date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series E are declared for any future Dividend Period. 
 (b)  Priority of Dividends. The Series E will rank (i) senior to the Common Stock and any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be junior to the Series E, (ii) junior to any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be senior to the Series E (issued with the requisite consent of the holders of the Series E, if required) and (iii) equally with the Series A, the Series C and each other class or series of Preferred Stock the Corporation may issue that is not expressly stated to be senior or junior to the Series E, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. 
So long as any share of Series E remains outstanding, no dividend or distribution shall be paid or declared on Junior Stock, and no Junior Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly, during a Dividend Period, unless the full dividend for the latest completed Dividend Period on all outstanding shares of Series E has been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). The foregoing limitation shall not apply to: 
   
   â€¢  repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with (1) any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants or (2) a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan; 
   
   â€¢  an exchange, redemption, reclassification or conversion of any class or series of Junior Stock, or any junior stock of a subsidiary of the Corporation, for any class or series of J unior Stock; 
   
   â€¢  the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Stock under the conversion or exchange provisions of Junior Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; 
   
   â€¢  any declaration of a dividend in connection with any stockholders' rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any stockholders' rights plan, or the redem ption or repurchase of rights pursuant to the plan; or 
   
   â€¢  any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the s ame stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equal or junior to that stock. 
 In addition, the foregoing limitation shall not restrict the ability of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, or any other affiliate of the Corporation, to engage in any market-making transactions in Junior Stock in the ordinary course of business.

When dividends are not paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside) on any Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within a related Dividend Period) in full upon the Series E and any shares of Parity Stock, all dividends declared on the Series E and all such Parity Stock and payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within the related Dividend Period) shall be declared  pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the Series E and all Parity Stock payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within t he related Dividend Period) bear to each other. 
Subject to the foregoing, dividends (payable in cash, securities or other property) may be determined by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors and may be declared and paid on the Common Stock and any stock ranking, as to dividends, equally with or junior to the Series E, from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the Series E shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividends. 
 (c)  Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends. Dividends on the Series E will not be declared, paid or set aside for payment if the Corporation fails to comply, or if and to the extent such act would cause the Corporation to fail to comply, with applicable laws and regulations, including the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency) applicable to the Corporation. 
 5.  Liquidation Rights . 
 (a)  Voluntary or Involuntary Liquidation. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, holders of Series E shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof available for distribution to stockholders of the Corporation, after satisfaction of all liabilities to creditors, if any, of the Corporation and subject to the rights of holders of any shares of capital stock of the Corporation then outstanding ranking senior to or pari passu with the Series E in respect of distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, and before any distribution of such assets or proceeds is made to or set aside for the holders of Common Stock and any other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series E as to such distribution, a liquidating distribution in an amount equal to $25,000 per share, together with an amount equal to all dividends, if any, that have been declared but not paid prior to the date of payment of such distribution (but without any accumulation in respect of dividends that have not been declared prior to such payment date). Holders of the Series E will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received th eir full liquidation preference. 
 (b)  Partial Payment. If in any distribution described in Section 5(a) above the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay the Liquidation Preference (as defined below) in full to all holders of Series E and all holders of any stock of the Corporation ranking equally with the Series E as to such distribution, the amounts paid to the holders of Seri es E and to the holders of all such other stock shall be paid  pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate Liquidation Preference of the holders of Series E and the holders of all such other stock. In any such distribution, the " Liquidation Preference " of any holder of stock of the 
   
 6 
 
 
Corporation shall mean the amount otherwise payable to such holder in such distribution (assuming no limitation on the assets of the Corporation available for such distribution), including an amount equal to any declared but unpaid dividends (and, in the case of any holder of stock other than Series E and on which dividends accrue on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to any unpaid, accrued, cumulative dividends, whether or not declared, as applicable). Holders of the Series E will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received the full amounts provided for in this Section 5 and will have no right or claim to any of the Corporation's remaining assets. 
 (c)  Residual Distributions. If the Liquidation Preference has been paid in full to all holders of Series E and any other shares of the Corporation's stock ranking equally as to the Liquidation Preference, the holders of other stock of the Corporation ranking junior as to the Liquidation Preference shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation (or proceeds there of) according to their respective rights and preferences. 
 (d)  Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 5, the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Series E receive cash, securities or other property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange (for cash, securities or other property) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. 
 6.  Redemption . 
 (a)  Optional Redemption. The Corporation may, at its option, redeem the Series E (i) in whole or in part, from time to time, on any Dividend Payment Date on or after October 15, 2023 or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within 90 days following a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event (as defined below), in each case upon notice given as provided in Section 6(c) below, at a redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, together with (except as otherwise provided herein below) any declared and unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. The redemption price for any shares of Series E shall be payable on the redemption date to the holder of such shares against surrender of the certificate(s) evidencing such shares to the Corporation or its agent. Any declared and unpaid dividend for the then current Dividend Period payable on a redemption date that occurs subsequent to the Dividend Record Date for a Dividend Period shall not be paid to the holder entitled to receive the redemption price on the redemption date, but rather shall be paid to the holder of record of the redeemed shares on such Dividend Record Date relating to the Dividend Payment Date as provided in Section 4 above. 
 A " Regulatory Capital Treatment Event" means the good faith determination by the Corporation that, as a result of (i) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States that is enacted or becomes effective after September 24, 2013, (ii) any proposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after September 24, 2013, or (iii) any official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws or regulations that is announced after September 24, 2013, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Corporation will not be entitled to treat the full liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share of Series E then outstanding as "Additional Tier 1" capital (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines of th e Federal Reserve Board (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy 
   
 7 
 
 
guidelines or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency) as then in effect and applicable, for so long as any share of Series E is outstanding. " Appropriate federal banking agency" means the "appropriate federal banking agency" with respect to the Corporation as that term is defined in Section 3(q) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or any successor provi sion. 
 (b)  No Sinking Fund. The Series E will not be subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. Holders of Series E will have no right to require the redemption or repurc hase of any shares of Series E. 
 (c)  Notice of Redemption. Notice of every redemption of shares of Series E shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Subsection shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Series E designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series E. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the depositary shares representing interests in the Series E are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company or any other similar facility, notice of redemption may be given to the holders of Series E at such time and in any manner permitted by such facility. Each such notice given to a holder shall state: (1) the redemption date; (2) the number of shares of Series E to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (3) the redemption price; and (4) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surr endered for payment of the redemption price. 
 (d)  Partial Redemption. In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series E at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected either  pro rata or by lot. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Corporation shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series E shall be redeemed from time to time. If fewer than all the shares represented by any certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares without charge  to the holder thereof. 
 (e)  Effectiveness of Redemption. If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corp oration, separate and apart from its other funds, in trust for the  pro rata benefit of the holders of any shares of Series E so called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date dividends shall cease to accrue on all shares so called for redemption, all shares so called for redemption shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption, without interest. Any funds unclaimed at the end of two years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released to the Corporation, after which time the holders of the shares so called for redemption shall look only to the Corporation for payme nt of the redemption price of such shares.

 7.  Voting Rights . 
 (a)  General. The holders of Series E shall not have any voting rights except as set forth below and as determined by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof or as otherwise  from time to time required by law. 
 (b)  Right To Elect Two Directors Upon Nonpayment Events. If and whenever dividends on any shares of the Series E, or any other Voting Preferred Stock, shall have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend pay ments, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods (a " Nonpayment"), the holders of such shares, voting together as a class with holders of any and all other series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding, will be entitled to vote for the ele ction of a total of two additional members of the Board of Directors (the " Preferred Stock Directors "),  provided that the election of any such directors shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and  provided further that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors. In that event, the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically increase by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series E or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting. Such request to call a special meeting for the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors after a Nonpayment shall be made by written notice, signed by the requisite holders of Series E or other Voting Preferred Stock, and delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation in such manner as provided for in Section 9 below, or as may otherwise be required by law. The voting rights will continue until dividends on the shares of the Series E and any such series of Voting Preferred Stock shall have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of such dividends shall have been set aside for such payment) for at least four consecutive regular dividend periods following the Nonpayment. 
If and when dividends for at least four consecutive regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for such payment shall have been set aside) on the Series E and any other class or series of Voting Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series E and all other holders of Voting Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each subsequent Nonpayment), the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically decrease by two. In determining whether dividends have been paid for at least four consecutive regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment, the Corporation may take account of any dividend it elects to pay for any dividend period after the regular dividend date for that period has passed. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series E together with all series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting together as a single class) to the extent such holders have the voting rights described above. So long as a Nonpayment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the initial election after a Nonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series E and all Voting Preferr ed Stock when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a single class);  provided that the filling of each vacancy shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors. Any such vote to remove, or to fill a vacancy in the office of, a Pre ferred Stock 
   
 9 
 
 
Director may be taken only at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series E or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders). The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 (c)  Other Voting Rights. So long as any shares of Series E are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Series E and any Voting Preferred Stock at the time outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating: 
 (i)  Authorization of Senior Stock. Any amendment or alteration of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking senior to the Series E with respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon any liquid ation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; 
 (ii)  Amendment of Series E. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designation, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series E, taken as a whole; or 
 (iii)  Share Exchanges, Reclassifications, Mergers and Consolidations. Any consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series E, or of a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with another entity, unless in each case (x) the shares of Series E remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (y) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series E, taken as a whole; 
 provided ,  however, that for all purposes of this Section 7(c), any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series E, Series A or Series C, or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking equally with the Series E with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation will not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of, and will not require the affirmative vote or consent of, the holders of outstanding shares of Series E. 
If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all other series of Voting Preferred Stock (including the Series E for this purpose), then only such series of Preferred Stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together as a class in lieu of all other series of Preferred Stock. If all series of a class of Preferred Stock are not equally affected by the proposed 
   
 10 
 
 
amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above, there shall be required a two-thirds approval of the class and a two-third s approval of each series that will have a diminished status. 
 (d)  Changes for Clarification. Without the consent of the holders of the Series E, so long as such action does not adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series E, the Corporation may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series E: 
(i) to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in this Certificate of Designation that may be defective or inconsistent; or 
(ii) to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series E that is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Certificate of Designation . 
 (e)  Changes after Provision for Redemption. No vote or consent of the holders of Series E shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b), (c) or (d) above if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which any such vote or consent would otherwise be required pursuant to such Section, all outstanding shares of Series E shall have been redeemed, or shall have been called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above. 
 (f)  Procedures for Voting and Consents. The rules and procedures for calling and conducting any meeting of the holders of Series E (including, without limitation, the fixing of a record date in connection therewith), the solicitation and use of proxies at such a meeting, the obtaining of written consents and any other aspect or matter with regard to such a meeting or such consents shall be governed by any rules the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may adopt from time to time, which rules and procedures shall conform to the requirements of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, applicable law and any national securities exchange or other trading facility on which the Series E is listed or traded at the time. Whether the vote or consent of the holders of a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series E and any Voting Preferred Stock has been cast or given on any matter on which the holders of shares of Series E are entitled to vote shall be determined by the Corporation by reference to the specified liquidation amounts  of the shares voted or covered by the consent. 
 8.  Record Holders. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation and the transfer agent for the Series E may deem and treat the record holder of any share of Series E as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the Corporation nor such transfer agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. 
 9.  Notices. All notices or communications in respect of Series E shall be sufficiently given if given in writing and delivered in person or by first class mail, postage prepaid, or if given in such other manner as may be permitted in this Certificate of Designation, in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or by applicable law. 
 10.  No Preemptive Rights. No share of Series E shall have any rights of preemption whatsoever as to any securities of the Corporation, or any warrants, rights or options issued or granted with respect thereto, regardless of how such securities, or such warrants, rights or options, may be designated, issued or granted. 
   
 11 
 
 
 11.  Other Rights. The shares of Series E shall not have any voting powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other special rights, or qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, other than as set forth herein or in the Certificate of Incorporation or as provided by applicable law.

These dividends will accrue on the liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share at a rate per annum equal to 6.875% with respect to each Dividend Period from and including the Original Issue Date to, but excluding, January 15, 20 24 (the " Fixed Rate Period") and at a rate per annum equal to the three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR on the related Dividend Determination Date plus 3.94% with respect to each Dividend Period from and including  January 15, 2024 (the " Floating Rate Period"). In the event that the Corporation issues additional shares of Series F after the Original Issue Date, dividends on such shares may accrue from the Original Issue Date or any other date specified by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof at the time such additional shares are issued. 
Dividends that are payable on Series F on any Dividend Payment Date will be payable to holders of record of Series F as they appear on the stock register of the Corporation on the  applicable record date, which shall be the 15 th calendar day before such Dividend Payment Date or such other record date fixed by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors that is not more  than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such Dividend Payment Date (each, a " Dividend Record Date "). 
 A " Dividend Period" is the period from and including a Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next Dividend Payment Date or any earlier redemption date, except that (i) the initial Dividend Period for any share of Series F issued on the Original Issue Date will commence on and include the Original Issue Date of the Series F and will end on and exclude the January 15, 2014 Dividend Payment Date, and (ii) for any share of Series F issued after the Original Issue Date, the initial Dividend Period for such shares may commence on and include the Original Issue Date or such other date as the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors shall 
   
 3 
 
 
determine and publicly disclose and shall end on and exclude the next Dividend Payment Date. Dividends payable on the Series F for any Dividend Period during the Fixed Rate Period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dividends payable on the Series F for any Dividend Period during the Floating Rate Period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the Dividend Period. Dividends for the initial Dividend Period for shares of Series F issued on the Original Issue Date will be calculated from the Original Issue Date. If any scheduled Dividend Payment Date up to and including the January 15, 2024 scheduled Dividend Payment Date is not a Business Day, then the payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional dividends will accrue as a result of that postponement. If any scheduled Dividend Payment Date thereafter is not a Business Day, then the Dividend Payment Date will be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day unless such day falls in the next calendar month, in which case the Dividend Payment Date will be brought forward to the immediately preceding day that is a Business Day, and, in either case, dividends will accrue t o, but excluding, the date dividends are paid. 
For any Dividend Period during the Floating Rate Period, LIBOR (the London interbank offered rate) shall be determined by the Calculation Agent on the Dividend Determination Date i n the following manner: 
(i) LIBOR will be the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of three months, commencing on the first day of such Dividend Period, that appears on Reuters screen page "LIBOR01", or any successor page, at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Dividend Determination Date. 
(ii) If no such rate appears, then the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market, selected by the Calculation Agent as directed by the Corporation, to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of three months, commencing on the first day of such Dividend Period, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Dividend Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR determined on that Dividend Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR will be determined for the first day of such Dividend Period as the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York time, on that Dividend Determination Date, by three major banks in New York City, selected by the Calculation Agent as directed by the Corporation, for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks, for a period of three months, commencing on the first day of such Dividend Period, and in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time. If the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, LIBOR for that Dividend Determination Date will be the same as LIBOR for the immediately preceding Dividend Period, or, if there was no such Dividend  Period, the dividend payable will be based on the initial dividend rate. 
The Calculation Agent's determination of any dividend rate, and its calculation of the amount of dividends for any Dividend Period, will be on file at the Corporation's principal offices, will be made available to any stockholder upon request and will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error. 
 " Reuters " means Reuters 3000 Xtra Service or any successor service.

Holders of Series F shall not be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, securities or other property, other than dividends (if any) declared and payable on the Series F as specified in this Section 4 (subject to the other provisions of this Certificate of Designation). 
Dividends on shares of the Series F will not be cumulative. Accordingly, if the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) does not declare a dividend on the Series F payable in respect of any Dividend Period before the related Dividend Payment Date, such dividend will not accrue and the Corporation will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that Dividend Period on the Dividend Payment Date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series F are declared for any future Dividend Period. 
 (b)  Priority of Dividends. The Series F will rank (i) senior to the Common Stock and any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be junior to the Series F, (ii) junior to any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be senior to the Series F (issued with the requisite consent of the holders of the Series F, if required) and (iii) equally with the Series A, the Series C, the Series E and each other class or series of Preferred Stock the Corporation may issue that is not expressly stated to be senior or junior to the Series F, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. 
So long as any share of Series F remains outstanding, no dividend or distribution shall be paid or declared on Junior Stock, and no Junior Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly, during a Dividend Period, unless the full dividend for the latest completed Dividend Period on all outstanding shares of Series F has been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). The foregoing limitation shall not apply to: 
   
   â€¢  repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with (1) any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants or (2) a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan; 
   
   â€¢  an exchange, redemption, reclassification or conversion of any class or series of Junior Stock, or any junior stock of a subsidiary of the Corporation, for any class or series of J unior Stock; 
   
   â€¢  the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Stock under the conversion or exchange provisions of Junior Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; 
   
   â€¢  any declaration of a dividend in connection with any stockholders' rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any stockholders' rights plan, or the redem ption or repurchase of rights pursuant to the plan; or 
   
   â€¢  any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the s ame stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equal or junior to that stock. 
 In addition, the foregoing limitation shall not restrict the ability of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, or any other affiliate of the Corporation, to engage in any market-making transactions in Junior Stock in the ordinary course of business.

When dividends are not paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside) on any Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within a related Dividend Period) in full upon the Series F and any shares of Parity Stock, all dividends declared on the Series F and all such Parity Stock and payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within the related Dividend Period) shall be declared  pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the Series F and all Parity Stock payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within t he related Dividend Period) bear to each other. 
Subject to the foregoing, dividends (payable in cash, securities or other property) may be determined by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors and may be declared and paid on the Common Stock and any stock ranking, as to dividends, equally with or junior to the Series F, from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the Series F shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividends. 
 (c)  Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends. Dividends on the Series F will not be declared, paid or set aside for payment if the Corporation fails to comply, or if and to the extent such act would cause the Corporation to fail to comply, with applicable laws and regulations, including the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency) applicable to the Corporation. 
 5.  Liquidation Rights . 
 (a)  Voluntary or Involuntary Liquidation. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, holders of Series F shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof available for distribution to stockholders of the Corporation, after satisfaction of all liabilities to creditors, if any, of the Corporation and subject to the rights of holders of any shares of capital stock of the Corporation then outstanding ranking senior to or pari passu with the Series F in respect of distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, and before any distribution of such assets or proceeds is made to or set aside for the holders of Common Stock and any other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series F as to such distribution, a liquidating distribution in an amount equal to $25,000 per share, together with an amount equal to all dividends, if any, that have been declared but not paid prior to the date of payment of such distribution (but without any accumulation in respect of dividends that have not been declared prior to such payment date). Holders of the Series F will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received th eir full liquidation preference. 
 (b)  Partial Payment. If in any distribution described in Section 5(a) above the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay the Liquidation Preference (as defined below) in full to all holders of Series F and all holders of any stock of the Corporation ranking equally with the Series F as to such distribution, the amounts paid to the holders of Seri es F and to the holders of all such other stock shall be paid  pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate Liquidation Preference of the holders of Series F and the holders of all such other stock. In any such distribution, the "Liquidation P reference" of any holder of stock of the 
   
 6 
 
 
Corporation shall mean the amount otherwise payable to such holder in such distribution (assuming no limitation on the assets of the Corporation available for such distribution), including an amount equal to any declared but unpaid dividends (and, in the case of any holder of stock other than Series F and on which dividends accrue on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to any unpaid, accrued, cumulative dividends, whether or not declared, as applicable). Holders of the Series F will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received the full amounts provided for in this Section 5 and will have no right or claim to any of the Corporation's remaining assets. 
 (c)  Residual Distributions. If the Liquidation Preference has been paid in full to all holders of Series F and any other shares of the Corporation's stock ranking equally as to the Liquidation Preference, the holders of other stock of the Corporation ranking junior as to the Liquidation Preference shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation (or proceeds there of) according to their respective rights and preferences. 
 (d)  Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 5, the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Series F receive cash, securities or other property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange (for cash, securities or other property) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. 
 6.  Redemption . 
 (a)  Optional Redemption. The Corporation may, at its option, redeem the Series F (i) in whole or in part, from time to time, on any Dividend Payment Date on or after January 15, 2024 or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within 90 days following a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event (as defined below), in each case upon notice given as provided in Section 6(c) below, at a redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, together with (except as otherwise provided herein below) any declared and unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. The redemption price for any shares of Series F shall be payable on the redemption date to the holder of such shares against surrender of the certificate(s) evidencing such shares to the Corporation or its agent. Any declared and unpaid dividend for the then current Dividend Period payable on a redemption date that occurs subsequent to the Dividend Record Date for a Dividend Period shall not be paid to the holder entitled to receive the redemption price on the redemption date, but rather shall be paid to the holder of record of the redeemed shares on such Dividend Record Date relating to the Dividend Payment Date as provided in Section 4 above. 
 A " Regulatory Capital Treatment Event" means the good faith determination by the Corporation that, as a result of (i) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States that is enacted or becomes effective after December 5, 2013, (ii) any proposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after December 5, 2013, or (iii) any official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws or regulations that is announced after December 5, 2013, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Corporation will not be entitled to treat the full liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share of Series F then outstanding as "Additional Tier 1" capital (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines of the Fede ral Reserve Board (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or 
   
 7 
 
 
regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency) as then in effect and applicable, for so long as any share of Series F is outstanding. " Appropriate federal banking agency" means the "appropriate federal banking agency" with respect to the Corporation as that term is defined in Section 3(q) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or any successor provi sion. 
 (b)  No Sinking Fund. The Series F will not be subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. Holders of Series F will have no right to require the redemption or repurc hase of any shares of Series F. 
 (c)  Notice of Redemption. Notice of every redemption of shares of Series F shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Subsection shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Series F designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series F. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the depositary shares representing interests in the Series F are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company or any other similar facility, notice of redemption may be given to the holders of Series F at such time and in any manner permitted by such facility. Each such notice given to a holder shall state: (1) the redemption date; (2) the number of shares of Series F to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (3) the redemption price; and (4) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surr endered for payment of the redemption price. 
 (d)  Partial Redemption. In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series F at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected either  pro rata or by lot. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Corporation shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series F shall be redeemed from time to time. If fewer than all the shares represented by any certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares without charge  to the holder thereof. 
 (e)  Effectiveness of Redemption. If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corp oration, separate and apart from its other funds, in trust for the  pro rata benefit of the holders of any shares of Series F so called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date dividends shall cease to accrue on all shares so called for redemption, all shares so called for redemption shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption, without interest. Any funds unclaimed at the end of two years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released to the Corporation, after which time the holders of the shares so called for redemption shall look only to the Corporation for payme nt of the redemption price of such shares.

 7.  Voting Rights. 
 (a)  General. The holders of Series F shall not have any voting rights except as set forth below and as determined by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof or as otherwise  from time to time required by law. 
 (b)  Right To Elect Two Directors Upon Nonpayment Events. If and whenever dividends on any shares of the Series F, or any other Voting Preferred Stock, shall have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend pay ments, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods (a " Nonpayment"), the holders of such shares, voting together as a class with holders of any and all other series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding, will be entitled to vote for the ele ction of a total of two additional members of the Board of Directors (the " Preferred Stock Directors "),  provided that the election of any such directors shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and  provided further that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors. In that event, the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically increase by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series F or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting. Such request to call a special meeting for the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors after a Nonpayment shall be made by written notice, signed by the requisite holders of Series F or other Voting Preferred Stock, and delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation in such manner as provided for in Section 9 below, or as may otherwise be required by law. The voting rights will continue until dividends on the shares of the Series F and any such series of Voting Preferred Stock shall have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of such dividends shall have been set aside for such payment) for at least four consecutive regular dividend periods following the Nonpayment. 
If and when dividends for at least four consecutive regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for such payment shall have been set aside) on the Series F and any other class or series of Voting Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series F and all other holders of Voting Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each subsequent Nonpayment), the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically decrease by two. In determining whether dividends have been paid for at least four consecutive regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment, the Corporation may take account of any dividend it elects to pay for any dividend period after the regular dividend date for that period has passed. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series F together with all series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting together as a single class) to the extent such holders have the voting rights described above. So long as a Nonpayment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the initial election after a Nonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series F and all Voting Preferr ed Stock when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a single class);  provided that the filling of each vacancy shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors. Any such vote to remove, or to fill a vacancy in the office of, a Pre ferred Stock 
   
 9 
 
 
Director may be taken only at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series F or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders). The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 (c)  Other Voting Rights. So long as any shares of Series F are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Series F and any Voting Preferred Stock at the time outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating: 
 (i)  Authorization of Senior Stock. Any amendment or alteration of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking senior to the Series F with respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon any liquid ation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; 
 (ii)  Amendment of Series F. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designation, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series F, taken as a whole; or 
 (iii)  Share Exchanges, Reclassifications, Mergers and Consolidations. Any consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series F, or of a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with another entity, unless in each case (x) the shares of Series F remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (y) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series F, taken as a whole; 
 provided ,  however, that for all purposes of this Section 7(c), any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series F, Series A, Series C or Series E, or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking equally with the Series F with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation will not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of, and will not require the affirmative vote or consent of, the holders of outstanding shares of Series F. 
If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all other series of Voting Preferred Stock (including the Series F for this purpose), then only such series of Preferred Stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter  shall vote on the matter together as a class in lieu of all other series of Preferred 
   
 10 
 
 
Stock. If all series of a class of Preferred Stock are not equally affected by the proposed amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above, there shall be required a two-thirds approval of the class and a two-thirds approval of each series that will have a diminished status. 
 (d)  Changes for Clarification. Without the consent of the holders of the Series F, so long as such action does not adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series F, the Corporation may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series F: 
(i) to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in this Certificate of Designation that may be defective or inconsistent; or 
(ii) to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series F that is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Certificate of Designation . 
 (e)  Changes after Provision for Redemption. No vote or consent of the holders of Series F shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b), (c) or (d) above if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which any such vote or consent would otherwise be required pursuant to such Section, all outstanding shares of Series F shall have been redeemed, or shall have been called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above. 
 (f)  Procedures for Voting and Consents. The rules and procedures for calling and conducting any meeting of the holders of Series F (including, without limitation, the fixing of a record date in connection therewith), the solicitation and use of proxies at such a meeting, the obtaining of written consents and any other aspect or matter with regard to such a meeting or such consents shall be governed by any rules the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may adopt from time to time, which rules and procedures shall conform to the requirements of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, applicable law and any national securities exchange or other trading facility on which the Series F is listed or traded at the time. Whether the vote or consent of the holders of a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series F and any Voting Preferred Stock has been cast or given on any matter on which the holders of shares of Series F are entitled to vote shall be determined by the Corporation by reference to the specified liquidation amounts  of the shares voted or covered by the consent. 
 8.  Record Holders. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation and the transfer agent for the Series F may deem and treat the record holder of any share of Series F as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the Corporation nor such transfer agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. 
 9.  Notices. All notices or communications in respect of Series F shall be sufficiently given if given in writing and delivered in person or by first class mail, postage prepaid, or if given in such other manner as may be permitted in this Certificate of Designation, in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or by applicable law. 
 10.  No Preemptive Rights. No share of Series F shall have any rights of preemption whatsoever as to any securities of the Corporation, or any warrants, rights or options issued or granted with respect thereto, regardless of how such securities, or such warrants, rights or options, may be designated, issued or granted. 
   
 11 
 
 
 11.  Other Rights. The shares of Series F shall not have any voting powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other special rights, or qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, other than as set forth herein or in the Certificate of Incorporation or as provided by applicable law.

been conferred and are exercisable. Voting Preferred Stock includes the Series A, the Series C, the Series E, the Series F and the Series H. Whether a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series G and any other Voting Preferred Stock have been voted in favor of any matter shall be determined by reference to the liquidation amounts of the sha res voted. 
 4.  Dividends . 
 (a)  Rate. Holders of Series G will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law, non-cumulative cash dividends from the Original Issue Date (in the case of the initial Dividend Period only) or the immediately preceding Dividend Payment Date, quarterly in arrears on each Dividend Payment Date, commencing on July 15, 2014. These dividends will accrue on the liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share at a rate per annum equal to 6.625%. In the event that the Corporation issues additional shares of Series G after the Original Issue Date, dividends on such shares may accrue from the Original Issue Date or any other date specified by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof at the time such additional shares are  issued. 
Dividends that are payable on Series G on any Dividend Payment Date will be payable to holders of record of Series G as they appear on the stock register of the Corporation on the  applicable record date, which shall be the 15 th calendar day before such Dividend Payment Date or such other record date fixed by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors that is not more  than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such Dividend Payment Date (each, a " Dividend Record Date "). 
 A " Dividend Period" is the period from and including a Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next Dividend Payment Date or any earlier redemption date, except that (i) the initial Dividend Period for any share of Series G issued on the Original Issue Date will commence on and include the Original Issue Date of the Series G and will end on and exclude the July 15, 2014 Dividend Payment Date, and (ii) for any share of Series G issued after the Original Issue Date, the initial Dividend Period for such shares may commence on and include the Original Issue Date or such other date as the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors shall determine and publicly disclose and shall end on and exclude the next Dividend Payment Date. Dividends payable on the Series G for any Dividend Period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dividends for the initial Dividend Period for shares of Series G issued on the Original Issue Date will be calculated from the Original Issue Date. If any scheduled Dividend Payment Date is not a Business Day, then the payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional dividends will accrue as a result of that postponement. 
Holders of Series G shall not be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, securities or other property, other than dividends (if any) declared and payable on the Series G as specified in this Section 4 (subject to the other provisions of this Certificate of Designation). 
Dividends on shares of the Series G will not be cumulative. Accordingly, if the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) does not declare a dividend on the Series G payable in respect of any Dividend Period before the related Dividend Payment Date, such dividend will not accrue and the Corporation will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that Dividend Period on the Dividend Payment Date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series G are declared for any future Dividend Period. 
   
 3 
 
 
 (b)  Priority of Dividends. The Series G will rank (i) senior to the Common Stock and any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be junior to the Series G, (ii) junior to any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be senior to the Series G (issued with the requisite consent of the holders of the Series G, if required) and (iii) equally with the Series A, the Series C, the Series E, the Series F, the Series H and each other class or series of Preferred Stock the Corporation may issue that is not expressly stated to be senior or junior to the Series G, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Co rporation. 
So long as any share of Series G remains outstanding, no dividend or distribution shall be paid or declared on Junior Stock, and no Junior Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly, during a Dividend Period, unless the full dividend for the latest completed Dividend Period on all outstanding shares of Series G has been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). The foregoing limitation shall not apply to: 
   
   â€¢  repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with (1) any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants or (2) a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan; 
   
   â€¢  an exchange, redemption, reclassification or conversion of any class or series of Junior Stock, or any junior stock of a subsidiary of the Corporation, for any class or series of J unior Stock; 
   
   â€¢  the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Stock under the conversion or exchange provisions of Junior Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; 
   
   â€¢  any declaration of a dividend in connection with any stockholders' rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any stockholders' rights plan, or the redem ption or repurchase of rights pursuant to the plan; or 
   
   â€¢  any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the s ame stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equal or junior to that stock. 
 In addition, the foregoing limitation shall not restrict the ability of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, or any other affiliate of the Corporation, to engage in any market-making transactions in Junior Stock in the ordinary course of business. 
When dividends are not paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside) on any Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within a related Dividend Period) in full upon the Series G and any shares of Parity Stock, all dividends declared on the Series G and all such Parity Stock and payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within the related Dividend Period) shall be declared  pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the Series G and all Parity Stock payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within t he related Dividend Period) bear to each other. 
   
 4 
 
 
Subject to the foregoing, dividends (payable in cash, securities or other property) may be determined by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors and may be declared and paid on the Common Stock and any stock ranking, as to dividends, equally with or junior to the Series G, from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the Series G shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividends. 
 (c)  Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends. Dividends on the Series G will not be declared, paid or set aside for payment if the Corporation fails to comply, or if and to the extent such act would cause the Corporation to fail to comply, with applicable laws and regulations, including the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency) applicable to the Corporation. 
 5.  Liquidation Rights. 
 (a)  Voluntary or Involuntary Liquidation. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, holders of Series G shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof available for distribution to stockholders of the Corporation, after satisfaction of all liabilities to creditors, if any, of the Corporation and subject to the rights of holders of any shares of capital stock of the Corporation then outstanding ranking senior to or pari passu with the Series G in respect of distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, and before any distribution of such assets or proceeds is made to or set aside for the holders of Common Stock and any other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series G as to such distribution, a liquidating distribution in an amount equal to $25,000 per share, together with an amount equal to all dividends, if any, that have been declared but not paid prior to the date of payment of such distribution (but without any accumulation in respect of dividends that have not been declared prior to such payment date). Holders of the Series G will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received th eir full liquidation preference. 
 (b)  Partial Payment. If in any distribution described in Section 5(a) above the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay the Liquidation Preference (as defined below) in full to all holders of Series G and all holders of any stock of the Corporation ranking equally with the Series G as to such distribution, the amounts paid to the holders of Seri es G and to the holders of all such other stock shall be paid  pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate Liquidation Preference of the holders of Series G and the holders of all such other stock. In any such distribution, the " Liquidation Preference" of any holder of stock of the Corporation shall mean the amount otherwise payable to such holder in such distribution (assuming no limitation on the assets of the Corporation available for such distribution), including an amount equal to any declared but unpaid dividends (and, in the case of any holder of stock other than Series G and on which dividends accrue on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to any unpaid, accrued, cumulative dividends, whether or not declared, as applicable). Holders of the Series G will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received the full amounts provided for in this Section 5 and will have no right or claim to any of the Corporation's remaining  assets. 
   
 5 
 
 
 (c)  Residual Distributions. If the Liquidation Preference has been paid in full to all holders of Series G and any other shares of the Corporation's stock ranking equally as to the Liquidation Preference, the holders of other stock of the Corporation ranking junior as to the Liquidation Preference shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation (or proceeds there of) according to their respective rights and preferences. 
 (d)  Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 5, the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Series G receive cash, securities or other property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange (for cash, securities or other property) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. 
 6.  Redemption. 
 (a)  Optional Redemption. The Corporation may, at its option, redeem the Series G (i) in whole or in part, from time to time, on any Dividend Payment Date on or after July 15, 2019 or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within 90 days following a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event (as defined below), in each case upon notice given as provided in Section 6(c) below, at a redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, together with (except as otherwise provided herein below) any declared and unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. The redemption price for any shares of Series G shall be payable on the redemption date to the holder of such shares against surrender of the certificate(s) evidencing such shares to the Corporation or its agent. Any declared and unpaid dividend for the then current Dividend Period payable on a redemption date that occurs subsequent to the Dividend Record Date for a Dividend Period shall not be paid to the holder entitled to receive the redemption price on the redemption date, but rather shall be paid to the holder of record of the redeemed shares on such Dividend Record Date relating to the Dividend Payment Date as provided in Section 4 above. 
 A " Regulatory Capital Treatment Event" means the good faith determination by the Corporation that, as a result of (i) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States that is enacted or becomes effective after April 22, 2014, (ii) any proposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after April 22, 2014, or (iii) any official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws or regulations that is announced after April 22, 2014, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Corporation will not be entitled to treat the full liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share of Series G then outstanding as "Additional Tier 1" capital (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency) as then in effect and applicable, for so  long as any share of Series G is outstanding. " Appropriate federal banking agency" means the "appropriate federal banking agency" with respect to the Corporation as that term is defined in Section 3(q) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or any successor provi sion. 
 (b)  No Sinking Fund. The Series G will not be subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. Holders of Series G will have no right to require the redemption or repurc hase of any shares of Series G. 
   
 6 
 
 
 (c)  Notice of Redemption. Notice of every redemption of shares of Series G shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Subsection shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure to duly give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Series G designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series G. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the depositary shares representing interests in the Series G are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company or any other similar facility, notice of redemption may be given to the holders of Series G at such time and in any manner permitted by such facility. Each such notice given to a holder shall state: (1) the redemption date; (2) the number of shares of Series G to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (3) the redemption price; and (4) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surr endered for payment of the redemption price. 
 (d)  Partial Redemption. In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series G at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected either  pro rata or by lot. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Corporation shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series G shall be redeemed from time to time. If fewer than all the shares represented by any certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares without charge  to the holder thereof. 
 (e)  Effectiveness of Redemption. If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corp oration, separate and apart from its other funds, in trust for the  pro rata benefit of the holders of any shares of Series G so called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date dividends shall cease to accrue on all shares so called for redemption, all shares so called for redemption shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption, without interest. Any funds unclaimed at the end of two years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released to the Corporation, after which time the holders of the shares so called for redemption shall look only to the Corporation for payme nt of the redemption price of such shares. 
 7.  Voting Rights . 
 (a)  General. The holders of Series G shall not have any voting rights except as set forth below and as determined by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof or as otherwise  from time to time required by law. 
 (b)  Right To Elect Two Directors Upon Nonpayment Events. If and whenever dividends on any shares of the Series G, or any other Voting Preferred Stock, shall have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend pay ments, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods (a " Nonpayment"), the holders of such shares, voting together as a class with holders of any and all other series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding, will be entitled to vote for the ele ction of a total of two additional members of the Board of Directors (the " Preferred 
   
 7 
 
 
 Stock Directors "),  provided that the election of any such directors shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and  provided further that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors. In that event, the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically increase by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series G or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting. Such request to call a special meeting for the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors after a Nonpayment shall be made by written notice, signed by the requisite holders of Series G or other Voting Preferred Stock, and delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation in such manner as provided for in Section 9 below, or as may otherwise be required by law. The voting rights will continue until dividends on the shares of the Series G and any such series of Voting Preferred Stock shall have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of such dividends shall have been set aside for such payment) for at least four consecutive regular dividend periods following the Nonpayment. 
If and when dividends for at least four consecutive regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for such payment shall have been set aside) on the Series G and any other class or series of Voting Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series G and all other holders of Voting Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each subsequent Nonpayment), the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically decrease by two. In determining whether dividends have been paid for at least four consecutive regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment, the Corporation may take account of any dividend it elects to pay for any dividend period after the regular dividend date for that period has passed. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series G together with all series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting together as a single class) to the extent such holders have the voting rights described above. So long as a Nonpayment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the initial election after a Nonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series G and all Voting Preferr ed Stock when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a single class);  provided that the filling of each vacancy shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors. Any such vote to remove, or to fill a vacancy in the office of, a Preferred Stock Director may be taken only at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series G or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders). The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 (c)  Other Voting Rights. So long as any shares of Series G are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Series G and any Voting Preferred Stock at the time outstanding 
   
 8 
 
 
and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose,  shall be necessary for effecting or validating: 
 (i)  Authorization of Senior Stock. Any amendment or alteration of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking senior to the Series G with respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon any liquid ation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; 
 (ii)  Amendment of Series G. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designation, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series G, taken as a whole; or 
 (iii)  Share Exchanges, Reclassifications, Mergers and Consolidations. Any consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series G, or of a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with another entity, unless in each case (x) the shares of Series G remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (y) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series G, taken as a whole; 
 provided ,  however, that for all purposes of this Section 7(c), any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series G, Series A, Series C, Series E, Series F, or Series H or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking equally with the Series G with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation will not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of, and will not require the affirmative vote or consent of, the holders of outstanding shares of Series G. 
If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all other series of Voting Preferred Stock (including the Series G for this purpose), then only such series of Preferred Stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together as a class in lieu of all other series of Preferred Stock. If all series of a class of Preferred Stock are not equally affected by the proposed amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above, there shall be required a two-thirds approval of the class and a two-thirds  approval of each series that will have a diminished status. 
   
 9 
 
 
 (d)  Changes for Clarification. Without the consent of the holders of the Series G, so long as such action does not adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series G, the Corporation may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series G: 
(i) to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in this Certificate of Designation that may be defective or inconsistent; or 
(ii) to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series G that is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Certificate of Designation . 
 (e)  Changes after Provision for Redemption. No vote or consent of the holders of Series G shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b), (c) or (d) above if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which any such vote or consent would otherwise be required pursuant to such Section, all outstanding shares of Series G shall have been redeemed, or shall have been called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above. 
 (f)  Procedures for Voting and Consents. The rules and procedures for calling and conducting any meeting of the holders of Series G (including, without limitation, the fixing of a record date in connection therewith), the solicitation and use of proxies at such a meeting, the obtaining of written consents and any other aspect or matter with regard to such a meeting or such consents shall be governed by any rules the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may adopt from time to time, which rules and procedures shall conform to the requirements of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, applicable law and any national securities exchange or other trading facility on which the Series G is listed or traded at the time. Whether the vote or consent of the holders of a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series G and any Voting Preferred Stock has been cast or given on any matter on which the holders of shares of Series G are entitled to vote shall be determined by the Corporation by reference to the specified liquidation amounts  of the shares voted or covered by the consent. 
 8.  Record Holders. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation and the transfer agent for the Series G may deem and treat the record holder of any share of Series G as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the Corporation nor such transfer agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. 
 9.  Notices. All notices or communications in respect of Series G shall be sufficiently given if given in writing and delivered in person or by first class mail, postage prepaid, or if given in such other manner as may be permitted in this Certificate of Designation, in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or by applicable law. 
 10.  No Preemptive Rights. No share of Series G shall have any rights of preemption whatsoever as to any securities of the Corporation, or any warrants, rights or options issued or granted with respect thereto, regardless of how such securities, or such warrants, rights or options, may be designated, issued or granted. 
 11.  Other Rights. The shares of Series G shall not have any voting powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other special rights, or qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, other than as set forth herein or in the Certificate of Incorporation or as provided by applicable law.

Whether a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series H and any other Voting Preferred Stock have been voted in favor of any matter shall be determined by reference to the liquidation amounts of the shares voted. 
 4.  Dividends . 
 (a)  Rate. Holders of Series H will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law, non-cumulative cash dividends from the Original Issue Date (in the case of the initial Dividend Period only) or the imme diately preceding Dividend Payment Date, semi-annually in arrears on the 15 th day of January and July of each year, commencing on July 15, 2014 and ending on July 15, 2019 and thereafter quarterly in arrears on the 15 th day of January, April, July and October of each year. These dividends will accrue on the liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share at a rate per annum equal to 5.45% with respect to each Dividend Period from and including the Original Issue Date to, but excluding, July 15, 2019 (the " Fixed Rate Period") and at a rate per annum equal to the three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR on the related Dividend Determination Date plus 3.61% with respect to each Dividend Period from and including  July 15, 2019 (the " Floating Rate Period"). In the event that the Corporation issues additional shares of Series H after the Original Issue Date, dividends on such shares may accrue from the Original Issue Date or any other date specified by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof at the time such additional shares are issued. 
Dividends that are payable on Series H on any Dividend Payment Date will be payable to holders of record of Series H as they appear on the stock register of the Corporation on the  applicable record date, which shall be the 15 th calendar day before such Dividend Payment Date or such other record date fixed by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors that is not more  than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such Dividend Payment Date (each, a " Dividend Record Date "). 
   
 3 
 
 
 A " Dividend Period" is the period from and including a Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next Dividend Payment Date or any earlier redemption date, except that (i) the initial Dividend Period for any share of Series H issued on the Original Issue Date will commence on and include the Original Issue Date of the Series H and will end on and exclude the July 15, 2014 Dividend Payment Date, and (ii) for any share of Series H issued after the Original Issue Date, the initial Dividend Period for such shares may commence on and include the Original Issue Date or such other date as the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors shall determine and publicly disclose and shall end on and exclude the next Dividend Payment Date. Dividends payable on the Series H for any Dividend Period during the Fixed Rate Period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dividends payable on the Series H for any Dividend Period during the Floating Rate Period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the Dividend Period. Dividends for the initial Dividend Period for shares of Series H issued on the Original Issue Date will be calculated from the Original Issue Date. If any scheduled Dividend Payment Date up to and including the July 15, 2019 scheduled Dividend Payment Date is not a Business Day, then the payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional dividends will accrue as a result of that postponement. If any scheduled Dividend Payment Date thereafter is not a Business Day, then the Dividend Payment Date will be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day unless such day falls in the next calendar month, in which case the Dividend Payment Date will be brought forward to the immediately preceding day that is a Business Day, and, in either case, dividends will accrue to, but excluding, the date dividends are paid. 
For any Dividend Period during the Floating Rate Period, LIBOR (the London interbank offered rate) shall be determined by the Calculation Agent on the Dividend Determination Date i n the following manner: 
(i) LIBOR will be the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of three months, commencing on the first day of such Dividend Period, that appears on Reuters screen page "LIBOR01", or any successor page, at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Dividend Determination Date. 
(ii) If no such rate appears, then the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market, selected by the Calculation Agent as directed by the Corporation, to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of three months, commencing on the first day of such Dividend Period, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Dividend Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR determined on that Dividend Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR will be determined for the first day of such Dividend Period as the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York time, on that Dividend Determination Date, by three major banks in New York City, selected by the Calculation Agent as directed by the Corporation, for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks, for a period of three months, commencing on the first day of such Dividend Period, and in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time. If the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, LIBOR for that Dividend Determination Date will be the same as LIBOR for the immediately preceding Dividend Period, or, if there was no such Dividend  Period, the dividend payable will be based on the initial dividend rate. 
   
 4 
 
 
The Calculation Agent's determination of any dividend rate, and its calculation of the amount of dividends for any Dividend Period, will be on file at the Corporation's principal offices, will be made available to any stockholder upon request and will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error. 
 " Reuters " means Reuters 3000 Xtra Service or any successor service. 
Holders of Series H shall not be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, securities or other property, other than dividends (if any) declared and payable on the Series H as specified in this Section 4 (subject to the other provisions of this Certificate of Designation). 
Dividends on shares of the Series H will not be cumulative. Accordingly, if the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) does not declare a dividend on the Series H payable in respect of any Dividend Period before the related Dividend Payment Date, such dividend will not accrue and the Corporation will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that Dividend Period on the Dividend Payment Date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series H are declared for any future Dividend Period. 
 (b)  Priority of Dividends. The Series H will rank (i) senior to the Common Stock and any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be junior to the Series H, (ii) junior to any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be senior to the Series H (issued with the requisite consent of the holders of the Series H, if required) and (iii) equally with the Series A, the Series C, the Series E, the Series F, the Series G and each other class or series of Preferred Stock the Corporation may issue that is not expressly stated to be senior or junior to the Series H, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Co rporation. 
So long as any share of Series H remains outstanding, no dividend or distribution shall be paid or declared on Junior Stock, and no Junior Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly, during a Dividend Period, unless the full dividend for the latest completed Dividend Period on all outstanding shares of Series H has been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). The foregoing limitation shall not apply to: 
   
   â€¢  repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with (1) any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants or (2) a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan; 
   
   â€¢  an exchange, redemption, reclassification or conversion of any class or series of Junior Stock, or any junior stock of a subsidiary of the Corporation, for any class or series of J unior Stock; 
   
   â€¢  the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Stock under the conversion or exchange provisions of Junior Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; 
   
   â€¢  any declaration of a dividend in connection with any stockholders' rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any stockholders' rights plan, or the redem ption or repurchase of rights pursuant to the plan; or 
   
 5 
 
 
   â€¢  any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the s ame stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equal or junior to that stock. 
 In addition, the foregoing limitation shall not restrict the ability of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, or any other affiliate of the Corporation, to engage in any market-making transactions in Junior Stock in the ordinary course of business. 
When dividends are not paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside) on any Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within a related Dividend Period) in full upon the Series H and any shares of Parity Stock, all dividends declared on the Series H and all such Parity Stock and payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within the related Dividend Period) shall be declared  pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the Series H and all Parity Stock payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within t he related Dividend Period) bear to each other. 
Subject to the foregoing, dividends (payable in cash, securities or other property) may be determined by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors and may be declared and paid on the Common Stock and any stock ranking, as to dividends, equally with or junior to the Series H, from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the Series H shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividends. 
 (c)  Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends. Dividends on the Series H will not be declared, paid or set aside for payment if the Corporation fails to comply, or if and to the extent such act would cause the Corporation to fail to comply, with applicable laws and regulations, including the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency) applicable to the Corporation. 
 5.  Liquidation Rights . 
 (a)  Voluntary or Involuntary Liquidation. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, holders of Series H shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof available for distribution to stockholders of the Corporation, after satisfaction of all liabilities to creditors, if any, of the Corporation and subject to the rights of holders of any shares of capital stock of the Corporation then outstanding ranking senior to or pari passu with the Series H in respect of distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, and before any distribution of such assets or proceeds is made to or set aside for the holders of Common Stock and any other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series H as to such distribution, a liquidating distribution in an amount equal to $25,000 per share, together with an amount equal to all dividends, if any, that have been declared but not paid prior to the date of payment of such distribution (but without any accumulation in respect of dividends that have not been declared prior to such payment date). Holders of the Series H will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received th eir full liquidation preference. 
   
 6 
 
 
 (b)  Partial Payment. If in any distribution described in Section 5(a) above the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay the Liquidation Preference (as defined below) in full to all holders of Series H and all holders of any stock of the Corporation ranking equally with the Series H as to such distribution, the amounts paid to the holders of Seri es H and to the holders of all such other stock shall be paid  pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate Liquidation Preference of the holders of Series H and the holders of all such other stock. In any such distribution, the " Liquidation Preference" of any holder of stock of the Corporation shall mean the amount otherwise payable to such holder in such distribution (assuming no limitation on the assets of the Corporation available for such distribution), including an amount equal to any declared but unpaid dividends (and, in the case of any holder of stock other than Series H and on which dividends accrue on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to any unpaid, accrued, cumulative dividends, whether or not declared, as applicable). Holders of the Series H will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received the full amounts provided for in this Section 5 and will have no right or claim to any of the Corporation's remaining  assets. 
 (c)  Residual Distributions. If the Liquidation Preference has been paid in full to all holders of Series H and any other shares of the Corporation's stock ranking equally as to the Liquidation Preference, the holders of other stock of the Corporation ranking junior as to the Liquidation Preference shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation (or proceeds there of) according to their respective rights and preferences. 
 (d)  Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 5, the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Series H receive cash, securities or other property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange (for cash, securities or other property) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. 
 6.  Redemption . 
 (a)  Optional Redemption. The Corporation may, at its option, redeem the Series H (i) in whole or in part, from time to time, on any Dividend Payment Date on or after July 15, 2019 or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within 90 days following a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event (as defined below), in each case upon notice given as provided in Section 6(c) below, at a redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, together with (except as otherwise provided herein below) any declared and unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. The redemption price for any shares of Series H shall be payable on the redemption date to the holder of such shares against surrender of the certificate(s) evidencing such shares to the Corporation or its agent. Any declared and unpaid dividend for the then current Dividend Period payable on a redemption date that occurs subsequent to the Dividend Record Date for a Dividend Period shall not be paid to the holder entitled to receive the redemption price on the redemption date, but rather shall be paid to the holder of record of the redeemed shares on such Dividend Record Date relating to the Dividend Payment Date as provided in Section 4 above. 
 A " Regulatory Capital Treatment Event" means the good faith determination by the Corporation that, as a result of (i) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States that is enacted or becomes effective after April 22, 2014, (ii) any 
   
 7 
 
 
proposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after April 22, 2014, or (iii) any official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws or regulations that is announced after April 22, 2014, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Corporation will not be entitled to treat the full liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share of Series H then outstanding as "Additional Tier 1" capital (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency) as then in effect and applicable, for so long as any share of Series H is outstanding. " Appropriate federal banking agency" means the "appropriate federal banking agency" with respect to the Corporation as that term is defined in Section 3(q) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or any successor provi sion. 
 (b)  No Sinking Fund. The Series H will not be subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. Holders of Series H will have no right to require the redemption or repurc hase of any shares of Series H. 
 (c)  Notice of Redemption. Notice of every redemption of shares of Series H shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Subsection shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure to duly give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Series H designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series H. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the depositary shares representing interests in the Series H are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company or any other similar facility, notice of redemption may be given to the holders of Series H at such time and in any manner permitted by such facility. Each such notice given to a holder shall state: (1) the redemption date; (2) the number of shares of Series H to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (3) the redemption price; and (4) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surr endered for payment of the redemption price. 
 (d)  Partial Redemption. In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series H at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected either  pro rata or by lot. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Corporation shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series H shall be redeemed from time to time. If fewer than all the shares represented by any certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares without charge  to the holder thereof. 
 (e)  Effectiveness of Redemption. If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corp oration, separate and apart from its other funds, in trust for the  pro rata benefit of the holders of any shares of Series H so called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date dividends shall cease to accrue on all shares so called for redemption, all shares so called for redemption shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption, without interest. 
   
 8 
 
 
Any funds unclaimed at the end of two years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released to the Corporation, after which time the holders of the shares so called for redemption shall look only to the Corporation for payment of the redemption price of such shares. 
 7.  Voting Rights . 
 (a)  General. The holders of Series H shall not have any voting rights except as set forth below and as determined by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof or as otherwise  from time to time required by law. 
 (b)  Right To Elect Two Directors Upon Nonpayment Events. If and whenever dividends on any shares of the Series H, or any other Voting Preferred Stock, shall have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend pay ments, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods (a " Nonpayment"), the holders of such shares, voting together as a class with holders of any and all other series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding, will be entitled to vote for the ele ction of a total of two additional members of the Board of Directors (the " Preferred Stock Directors "),  provided that the election of any such directors shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and  provided further that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors. In that event, the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically increase by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series H or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting. Such request to call a special meeting for the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors after a Nonpayment shall be made by written notice, signed by the requisite holders of Series H or other Voting Preferred Stock, and delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation in such manner as provided for in Section 9 below, or as may otherwise be required by law. The voting rights will continue until dividends on the shares of the Series H and any such series of Voting Preferred Stock shall have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of such dividends shall have been set aside for such payment) for at least four consecutive regular dividend periods following the Nonpayment. 
If and when dividends for at least four consecutive regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for such payment shall have been set aside) on the Series H and any other class or series of Voting Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series H and all other holders of Voting Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each subsequent Nonpayment), the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically decrease by two. In determining whether dividends have been paid for at least four consecutive regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment, the Corporation may take account of any dividend it elects to pay for any dividend period after the regular dividend date for that period has passed. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series H together with all series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting together as a single class) to the extent such holders have the voting rights described above. So long as a Nonpayment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the initial election after a Nonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Prefe rred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none 
   
 9 
 
 
remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series H and all Voting Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights described  above (voting together as a single class);  provided that the filling of each vacancy shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors. Any such vote to remove, or to fill a vacancy in the office of, a Preferred Stock Director may be taken only at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series H or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders). The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 (c)  Other Voting Rights. So long as any shares of Series H are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Series H and any Voting Preferred Stock at the time outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating: 
 (i)  Authorization of Senior Stock. Any amendment or alteration of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking senior to the Series H with respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon any liquid ation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; 
 (ii)  Amendment of Series H. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designation, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series H, taken as a whole; or 
 (iii)  Share Exchanges, Reclassifications, Mergers and Consolidations. Any consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series H, or of a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with another entity, unless in each case (x) the shares of Series H remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (y) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series H, taken as a whole; 
 provided ,  however, that for all purposes of this Section 7(c), any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series H, Series A, Series C, Series E, Series F, or Series G, or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking equally with the Series H with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation will not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of, and will not require the affirmative vote or consent of, the holders of outstanding shares of Series H. 
   
 10 
 
 
If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all other series of Voting Preferred Stock (including the Series H for this purpose), then only such series of Preferred Stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together as a class in lieu of all other series of Preferred Stock. If all series of a class of Preferred Stock are not equally affected by the proposed amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above, there shall be required a two-thirds approval of the class and a two-thirds  approval of each series that will have a diminished status. 
 (d)  Changes for Clarification. Without the consent of the holders of the Series H, so long as such action does not adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series H, the Corporation may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series H: 
(i) to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in this Certificate of Designation that may be defective or inconsistent; or 
(ii) to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series H that is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Certificate of Designation . 
 (e)  Changes after Provision for Redemption. No vote or consent of the holders of Series H shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b), (c) or (d) above if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which any such vote or consent would otherwise be required pursuant to such Section, all outstanding shares of Series H shall have been redeemed, or shall have been called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above. 
 (f)  Procedures for Voting and Consents. The rules and procedures for calling and conducting any meeting of the holders of Series H (including, without limitation, the fixing of a record date in connection therewith), the solicitation and use of proxies at such a meeting, the obtaining of written consents and any other aspect or matter with regard to such a meeting or such consents shall be governed by any rules the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may adopt from time to time, which rules and procedures shall conform to the requirements of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, applicable law and any national securities exchange or other trading facility on which the Series H is listed or traded at the time. Whether the vote or consent of the holders of a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series H and any Voting Preferred Stock has been cast or given on any matter on which the holders of shares of Series H are entitled to vote shall be determined by the Corporation by reference to the specified liquidation amounts  of the shares voted or covered by the consent. 
 8.  Record Holders. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation and the transfer agent for the Series H may deem and treat the record holder of any share of Series H as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the Corporation nor such transfer agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. 
 9.  Notices. All notices or communications in respect of Series H shall be sufficiently given if given in writing and delivered in person or by first class mail, postage prepaid, or if given in such other manner as may be permitted in this Certificate of Designation, in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or by applicable law. 
   
 11 
 
 
 10.  No Preemptive Rights. No share of Series H shall have any rights of preemption whatsoever as to any securities of the Corporation, or any warrants, rights or options issued or granted with respect thereto, regardless of how such securities, or such warrants, rights or options, may be designated, issued or granted. 
 11.  Other Rights. The shares of Series H shall not have any voting powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other special rights, or qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, other than as set forth herein or in the Certificate of Incorporation or as provided by applicable law.

 4.  Dividends . 
 (a)  Rate. Holders of Series I will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law, non-cumulative cash dividends from the Original Issue Date (in the case of the initial Dividend Period only) or the immediately preceding Dividend Payment Date, quarterly in arrears on each Dividend Payment Date, commencing on January 15, 2015. These dividends will accrue on the liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share at a rate per annum equal to 6.375% with respect to each Dividend Period from and including the Original Issue Date to, but excluding, October 15, 20 24 (the " Fixed Rate Period") and at a rate per annum equal to the three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR on the related Dividend Determination Date plus 3.708% with respect to each Dividend Period from and including  October 15, 2024 (the " Floating Rate Period"). In the event that the Corporation issues additional shares of Series I after the Original Issue Date, dividends on such shares may accrue from the Original Issue Date or any other date specified by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof at the time such additional shares are issued. 
Dividends that are payable on Series I on any Dividend Payment Date will be payable to holders of record of Series I as they appear on the stock register of the Corporation on the  applicable record date, which shall be the 15 th calendar day before such Dividend Payment Date or such other record date fixed by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors that is not more  than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such Dividend Payment Date (each, a " Dividend Record Date "). 
   
 3 
 
 
 A " Dividend Period" is the period from and including a Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next Dividend Payment Date or any earlier redemption date, except that (i) the initial Dividend Period for any share of Series I issued on the Original Issue Date will commence on and include the Original Issue Date of the Series I and will end on and exclude the January 15, 2015 Dividend Payment Date, and (ii) for any share of Series I issued after the Original Issue Date, the initial Dividend Period for such shares may commence on and include the Original Issue Date or such other date as the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors shall determine and publicly disclose and shall end on and exclude the next Dividend Payment Date. Dividends payable on the Series I for any Dividend Period during the Fixed Rate Period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dividends payable on the Series I for any Dividend Period during the Floating Rate Period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the Dividend Period. Dividends for the initial Dividend Period for shares of Series I issued on the Original Issue Date will be calculated from the Original Issue Date. If any scheduled Dividend Payment Date up to and including the October 15, 2024 scheduled Dividend Payment Date is not a Business Day, then the payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional dividends will accrue as a result of that postponement. If any scheduled Dividend Payment Date thereafter is not a Business Day, then the Dividend Payment Date will be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day unless such day falls in the next calendar month, in which case the Dividend Payment Date will be brought forward to the immediately preceding day that is a Business Day, and, in either case, dividends will accrue to, but excluding, the date dividends are paid. 
For any Dividend Period during the Floating Rate Period, LIBOR (the London interbank offered rate) shall be determined by the Calculation Agent on the Dividend Determination Date i n the following manner: 
(i) LIBOR will be the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of three months, commencing on the first day of such Dividend Period, that appears on Reuters screen page "LIBOR01", or any successor page, at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Dividend Determination Date. 
(ii) If no such rate appears, then the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market, selected by the Calculation Agent as directed by the Corporation, to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of three months, commencing on the first day of such Dividend Period, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Dividend Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR determined on that Dividend Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR will be determined for the first day of such Dividend Period as the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York time, on that Dividend Determination Date, by three major banks in New York City, selected by the Calculation Agent as directed by the Corporation, for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks, for a period of three months, commencing on the first day of such Dividend Period, and in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time. If the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are n ot quoting as set forth 
   
 4 
 
 
above, LIBOR for that Dividend Determination Date will be the same as LIBOR for the immediately preceding Dividend Period, or, if there was no such Dividend Period, the dividend pa yable will be based on the initial dividend rate. 
The Calculation Agent's determination of any dividend rate, and its calculation of the amount of dividends for any Dividend Period, will be on file at the Corporation's principal offices, will be made available to any stockholder upon request and will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error. 
 " Reuters " means Reuters 3000 Xtra Service or any successor service. 
Holders of Series I shall not be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, securities or other property, other than dividends (if any) declared and payable on the Series I as specified in this Section 4 (subject to the other provisions of this Certificate of Designation). 
Dividends on shares of the Series I will not be cumulative. Accordingly, if the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) does not declare a dividend on the Series I payable in respect of any Dividend Period before the related Dividend Payment Date, such dividend will not accrue and the Corporation will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that Dividend Period on the Dividend Payment Date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series I are declared for any future Dividend Period. 
 (b)  Priority of Dividends. The Series I will rank (i) senior to the Common Stock and any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be junior to the Series I, (ii) junior to any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be senior to the Series I (issued with the requisite consent of the holders of the Series I, if required) and (iii) equally with the Series A, the Series C, the Series E, the Series F, the Series G, the Series H and each other class or series of Preferred Stock the Corporation may issue that is not expressly stated to be senior or junior to the Series I, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or windin g up of the Corporation. 
So long as any share of Series I remains outstanding, no dividend or distribution shall be paid or declared on Junior Stock, and no Junior Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly, during a Dividend Period, unless the full dividend for the latest completed Dividend Period on all outstanding shares of Series I has been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). The foregoing limitation shall not apply to: 
   
   â€¢  repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with (1) any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants or (2) a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan; 
   
   â€¢  an exchange, redemption, reclassification or conversion of any class or series of Junior Stock, or any junior stock of a subsidiary of the Corporation, for any class or series of J unior Stock; 
   
   â€¢  the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Stock under the conversion or exchange provisions of Junior Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; 
   
 5 
 
 
   â€¢  any declaration of a dividend in connection with any stockholders' rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any stockholders' rights plan, or the redem ption or repurchase of rights pursuant to the plan; or 
   
   â€¢  any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the s ame stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equal or junior to that stock. 
 In addition, the foregoing limitation shall not restrict the ability of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, or any other affiliate of the Corporation, to engage in any market-making transactions in Junior Stock in the ordinary course of business. 
When dividends are not paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside) on any Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within a related Dividend Period) in full upon the Series I and any shares of Parity Stock, all dividends declared on the Series I and all such Parity Stock and payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within the related Dividend Period) shall be declared  pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the Series I and all Parity Stock payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within t he related Dividend Period) bear to each other. 
Subject to the foregoing, dividends (payable in cash, securities or other property) may be determined by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors and may be declared and paid on the Common Stock and any stock ranking, as to dividends, equally with or junior to the Series I, from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the Series I shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividends. 
 (c)  Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends . Dividends on the Series I will not be declared, paid or set aside for payment if the Corporation fails to comply, or if and to the extent such act would cause the Corporation to fail to comply, with applicable laws and regulations, including the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency) applicable to the Corporation. 
 5.  Liquidation Rights . 
 (a)  Voluntary or Involuntary Liquidation. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, holders of Series I shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof available for distribution to stockholders of the Corporation, after satisfaction of all liabilities to creditors, if any, of the Corporation and subject to the rights of holders of any shares of capital stock of the Corporation then outstanding ranking senior to or pari passu with the Series I in respect of distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, and before any distribution of such assets or proceeds is made to or set aside for the holders of Common Stock and any other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series I as to such distribution, a liquidating distribution in an amount equal to $25,000 per share, together  with an amount equal to all dividends, if any, that have been declared but not paid prior to the 
   
 6 
 
 
date of payment of such distribution (but without any accumulation in respect of dividends that have not been declared prior to such payment date). Holders of the Series I will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received their full liquidation preference. 
 (b)  Partial Payment. If in any distribution described in Section 5(a) above the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay the Liquidation Preference (as defined below) in full to all holders of Series I and all holders of any stock of the Corporation ranking equally with the Series I as to such distribution, the amounts paid to the holders of Seri es I and to the holders of all such other stock shall be paid  pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate Liquidation Preference of the holders of Series I and the holders of all such other stock. In any such distribution, the " Liquidation Preference" of any holder of stock of the Corporation shall mean the amount otherwise payable to such holder in such distribution (assuming no limitation on the assets of the Corporation available for such distribution), including an amount equal to any declared but unpaid dividends (and, in the case of any holder of stock other than Series I and on which dividends accrue on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to any unpaid, accrued, cumulative dividends, whether or not declared, as applicable). Holders of the Series I will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received the full amounts provided for in this Section 5 and will have no right or claim to any of the Corporation's remaining  assets. 
 (c)  Residual Distributions. If the Liquidation Preference has been paid in full to all holders of Series I and any other shares of the Corporation's stock ranking equally as to the Liquidation Preference, the holders of other stock of the Corporation ranking junior as to the Liquidation Preference shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation (or proceeds there of) according to their respective rights and preferences. 
 (d)  Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 5, the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Series I receive cash, securities or other property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange (for cash, securities or other property) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. 
 6.  Redemption . 
 (a)  Optional Redemption. The Corporation may, at its option, redeem the Series I (i) in whole or in part, from time to time, on any Dividend Payment Date on or after October 15, 2024 or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within 90 days following a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event (as defined below), in each case upon notice given as provided in Section 6(c) below, at a redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, together with (except as otherwise provided herein below) any declared and unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. The redemption price for any shares of Series I shall be payable on the redemption date to the holder of such shares against surrender of the certificate(s) evidencing such shares to the Corporation or its agent. Any declared and unpaid dividend for the then current Dividend Period payable on a redemption date that occurs subsequent to the Dividend Record Date for a Dividend Period shall not be paid to the holder entitled to receive the redemption price on the redemption date, but rather shall be paid to the holder of record of the redeemed shares on such Dividend Record Date relating to the Dividend Payment Date as provided in Section 4 above. 
   
 7 
 
 
 A " Regulatory Capital Treatment Event" means the good faith determination by the Corporation that, as a result of (i) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States that is enacted or becomes effective after September 11, 2014, (ii) any proposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after September 11, 2014, or (iii) any official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws or regulations that is announced after September 11, 2014, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Corporation will not be entitled to treat the full liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share of Series I then outstanding as "Additional Tier 1" capital (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency) as then in effect and applica ble, for so long as any share of Series I is outstanding. " Appropriate federal banking agency" means the "appropriate federal banking agency" with respect to the Corporation as that term is defined in Section 3(q) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or any successor provi sion. 
 (b)  No Sinking Fund. The Series I will not be subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. Holders of Series I will have no right to require the redemption or repurc hase of any shares of Series I. 
 (c)  Notice of Redemption. Notice of every redemption of shares of Series I shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Subsection shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure to duly give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Series I designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series I. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the depositary shares representing interests in the Series I are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company or any other similar facility, notice of redemption may be given to the holders of Series I at such time and in any manner permitted by such facility. Each such notice given to a holder shall state: (1) the redemption date; (2) the number of shares of Series I to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (3) the redemption price; and (4) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surr endered for payment of the redemption price. 
 (d)  Partial Redemption. In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series I at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected either  pro rata or by lot. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Corporation shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series I shall be redeemed from time to time. If fewer than all the shares represented by any certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares without charge  to the holder thereof. 
 (e)  Effectiveness of Redemption. If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corp oration, separate and apart from its 
   
 8 
 
 
 other funds, in trust for the  pro rata benefit of the holders of any shares of Series I so called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date dividends shall cease to accrue on all shares so called for redemption, all shares so called for redemption shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption, without interest. Any funds unclaimed at the end of two years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released to the Corporation, after which time the holders of the shares so called for redemption shall look only to the Corporation for payme nt of the redemption price of such shares. 
 7.  Voting Rights . 
 (a)  General. The holders of Series I shall not have any voting rights except as set forth below and as determined by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof or as otherwise  from time to time required by law. 
 (b)  Right To Elect Two Directors Upon Nonpayment Events. If and whenever dividends on any shares of the Series I, or any other Voting Preferred Stock, shall have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend pay ments, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods (a " Nonpayment"), the holders of such shares, voting together as a class with holders of any and all other series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding, will be entitled to vote for the ele ction of a total of two additional members of the Board of Directors (the " Preferred Stock Directors "),  provided that the election of any such directors shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and  provided further that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors. In that event, the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically increase by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series I or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting. Such request to call a special meeting for the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors after a Nonpayment shall be made by written notice, signed by the requisite holders of Series I or other Voting Preferred Stock, and delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation in such manner as provided for in Section 9 below, or as may otherwise be required by law. The voting rights will continue until dividends on the shares of the Series I and any such series of Voting Preferred Stock shall have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of such dividends shall have been set aside for such payment) for at least four consecutive regular dividend periods following the Nonpayment. 
If and when dividends for at least four consecutive regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for such payment shall have been set aside) on the Series I and any other class or series of Voting Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series I and all other holders of Voting Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each subsequent Nonpayment), the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically decrease by two. In determining whether dividends have been paid for at 
   
 9 
 
 
least four consecutive regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment, the Corporation may take account of any dividend it elects to pay for any dividend period after the regular dividend date for that period has passed. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series I together with all series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting together as a single class) to the extent such holders have the voting rights described above. So long as a Nonpayment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the initial election after a Nonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series I and all Voting Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as a single class);  provided that the filling of each vacancy shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors. Any such vote to remove, or to fill a vacancy in the office of, a Preferred Stock Director may be taken only at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series I or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders). The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 (c)  Other Voting Rights. So long as any shares of Series I are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Series I and any Voting Preferred Stock at the time outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating: 
 (i)  Authorization of Senior Stock. Any amendment or alteration of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking senior to the Series I with respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon any liquid ation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; 
 (ii)  Amendment of Series I. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designation, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series I, taken as a whole; or 
 (iii)  Share Exchanges, Reclassifications, Mergers and Consolidations. Any consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series I, or of a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with another entity, unless in each case (x) the shares of Series I remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (y) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series I, taken as a whole; 
   
 10 
 
 
 provided ,  however, that for all purposes of this Section 7(c), any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series I, Series A, Series C, Series E, Series F, Series G, or Series H, or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking equally with the Series I with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation will not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of, and will not require the affirmative vote or consent of, the holders of outstanding shares of  Series I. 
If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all other series of Voting Preferred Stock (including the Series I for this purpose), then only such series of Preferred Stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together as a class in lieu of all other series of Preferred Stock. If all series of a class of Preferred Stock are not equally affected by the proposed amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above, there shall be required a two-thirds approval of the class and a two-thirds  approval of each series that will have a diminished status.

(i) to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in this Certificate of Designation that may be defective or inconsistent; or 
(ii) to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series I that is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Certificate of Designation . 
 (e)  Changes after Provision for Redemption. No vote or consent of the holders of Series I shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b), (c) or (d) above if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which any such vote or consent would otherwise be required pursuant to such Section, all outstanding shares of Series I shall have been redeemed, or shall have been called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above. 
 (f)  Procedures for Voting and Consents. The rules and procedures for calling and conducting any meeting of the holders of Series I (including, without limitation, the fixing of a record date in connection therewith), the solicitation and use of proxies at such a meeting, the obtaining of written consents and any other aspect or matter with regard to such a meeting or such consents shall be governed by any rules the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may adopt from time to time, which rules and procedures shall conform to the requirements of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, applicable law and any national securities exchange or other trading facility on which the Series I is listed or traded at the time. Whether the vote or consent of the holders of a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series I and any Voting Preferred Stock has been cast or given on any matter on which the holders of shares of Series I are entitled to vote shall be determined by the Corporation by reference to the specified liquidation amounts  of the shares voted or covered by the consent.

 4.  Dividends. 
 (a)  Rate. Holders of Series J will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law, non-cumulative cash dividends from the Original Issue Date (in the case of the initial Dividend Period only) or the imme diately preceding Dividend Payment Date, semi-annually in arrears on the 15 th day of January and July of each year, commencing on July 15, 2015 and ending on July 15, 2020 and thereafter quarterly in arrears on the 15 th day of January, April, July and October of each year. These dividends will accrue on the liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share at a rate per annum equal to 5.55% with respect to each Dividend Period from and including the Original Issue Date to, but excluding, July 15, 2020 (the " Fixed Rate Period") and at a rate per annum equal to the three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR on the related Dividend Determination Date plus 3.81% with respect to each Dividend Period from and including  July 15, 2020 (the " Floating Rate Period"). In the event that the Corporation issues additional shares of Series J after the Original Issue Date, dividends on such shares may accrue from the Original Issue Date or any other date specified by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof at the time such additional shares are issued. 
Dividends that are payable on Series J on any Dividend Payment Date will be payable to holders of record of Series J as they appear on the stock register of the Corporation on the  applicable record date, which shall be the 15 th  calendar day before 
   
 3 
 
 
such Dividend Payment Date or such other record date fixed by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors that is not more than 60 nor less than  10 days prior to such Dividend Payment Date (each, a " Dividend Record Date "). 
 A " Dividend Period" is the period from and including a Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next Dividend Payment Date or any earlier redemption date, except that (i) the initial Dividend Period for any share of Series J issued on the Original Issue Date will commence on and include the Original Issue Date of the Series J and will end on and exclude the July 15, 2015 Dividend Payment Date, and (ii) for any share of Series J issued after the Original Issue Date, the initial Dividend Period for such shares may commence on and include the Original Issue Date or such other date as the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors shall determine and publicly disclose and shall end on and exclude the next Dividend Payment Date. Dividends payable on the Series J for any Dividend Period during the Fixed Rate Period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dividends payable on the Series J for any Dividend Period during the Floating Rate Period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the Dividend Period. Dividends for the initial Dividend Period for shares of Series J issued on the Original Issue Date will be calculated from the Original Issue Date. If any scheduled Dividend Payment Date up to and including the July 15, 2020 scheduled Dividend Payment Date is not a Business Day, then the payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional dividends will accrue as a result of that postponement. If any scheduled Dividend Payment Date thereafter is not a Business Day, then the Dividend Payment Date will be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day unless such day falls in the next calendar month, in which case the Dividend Payment Date will be brought forward to the immediately preceding day that is a Business Day, and, in either case, dividends will accrue to, but excluding, the date dividends are paid. 
For any Dividend Period during the Floating Rate Period, LIBOR (the London interbank offered rate) shall be determined by the Calculation Agent on the Dividend Determination Date i n the following manner: 
(i) LIBOR will be the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of three months, commencing on the first day of such Dividend Period, that appears on Reuters screen page "LIBOR01", or any successor page, at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Dividend Determination Date. 
(ii) If no such rate appears, then the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market, selected by the Calculation Agent as directed by the Corporation, to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of three months, commencing on the first day of such Dividend Period, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Dividend Determination Date and in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR determined on that Dividend Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR will be determined for the first day of such Dividend Period as the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York time, on that Dividend Determination Date, by three major banks in New York City, selected by the Calculation Agent as directed by the Corporation, for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks, for a period of three months, commencing on the first day of such Dividend Period, and in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time. If the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are n ot quoting as set forth 
   
 4 
 
 
above, LIBOR for that Dividend Determination Date will be the same as LIBOR for the immediately preceding Dividend Period, or, if there was no such Dividend Period, the dividend pa yable will be based on the initial dividend rate. 
The Calculation Agent's determination of any dividend rate, and its calculation of the amount of dividends for any Dividend Period, will be on file at the Corporation's principal offices, will be made available to any stockholder upon request and will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error. 
 " Reuters " means Reuters 3000 Xtra Service or any successor service. 
Holders of Series J shall not be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, securities or other property, other than dividends (if any) declared and payable on the Series J as specified in this Section 4 (subject to the other provisions of this Certificate of Designation). 
Dividends on shares of the Series J will not be cumulative. Accordingly, if the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) does not declare a dividend on the Series J payable in respect of any Dividend Period before the related Dividend Payment Date, such dividend will not accrue and the Corporation will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that Dividend Period on the Dividend Payment Date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series J are declared for any future Dividend Period. 
 (b)  Priority of Dividends. The Series J will rank (i) senior to the Common Stock and any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be junior to the Series J, (ii) junior to any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be senior to the Series J (issued with the requisite consent of the holders of the Series J, if required) and (iii) equally with the Series A, the Series C, the Series E, the Series F, the Series G, the Series H, the Series I and each other class or series of Preferred Stock the Corporation may issue that is not expressly stated to be senior or junior to the Series J, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolu tion or winding up of the Corporation. 
So long as any share of Series J remains outstanding, no dividend or distribution shall be paid or declared on Junior Stock, and no Junior Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly, during a Dividend Period, unless the full dividend for the latest completed Dividend Period on all outstanding shares of Series J has been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). The foregoing limitation shall not apply to: 
   
   â€¢  repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with (1) any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants or (2) a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan; 
   
   â€¢  an exchange, redemption, reclassification or conversion of any class or series of Junior Stock, or any junior stock of a subsidiary of the Corporation, for any class or series of J unior Stock; 
   
   â€¢  the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Stock under the conversion or exchange provisions of Junior Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; 
   
 5 
 
 
   â€¢  any declaration of a dividend in connection with any stockholders' rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any stockholders' rights plan, or the redem ption or repurchase of rights pursuant to the plan; or 
   
   â€¢  any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the s ame stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equal or junior to that stock. 
 In addition, the foregoing limitation shall not restrict the ability of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, or any other affiliate of the Corporation, to engage in any market-making transactions in Junior Stock in the ordinary course of business. 
When dividends are not paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside) on any Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within a related Dividend Period) in full upon the Series J and any shares of Parity Stock, all dividends declared on the Series J and all such Parity Stock and payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within the related Dividend Period) shall be declared  pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the Series J and all Parity Stock payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within t he related Dividend Period) bear to each other. 
Subject to the foregoing, dividends (payable in cash, securities or other property) may be determined by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors and may be declared and paid on the Common Stock and any stock ranking, as to dividends, equally with or junior to the Series J, from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the Series J shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividends. 
 (c)  Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends. Dividends on the Series J will not be declared, paid or set aside for payment if the Corporation fails to comply, or if and to the extent such act would cause the Corporation to fail to comply, with applicable laws and regulations, including the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency) applicable to the Corporation. 
 5.  Liquidation Rights . 
 (a)  Voluntary or Involuntary Liquidation. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, holders of Series J shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof available for distribution to stockholders of the Corporation, after satisfaction of all liabilities to creditors, if any, of the Corporation and subject to the rights of holders of any shares of capital stock of the Corporation then outstanding ranking senior to or pari passu with the Series J in respect of distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, and before any distribution of such assets or proceeds is made to or set aside for the holders of Common Stock and any other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series J as to such distribution, a liquidating distribution in an amount equal to $25,000 per share, together  with an amount equal to all dividends, if any, that have been declared but not paid prior to the 
   
 6 
 
 
date of payment of such distribution (but without any accumulation in respect of dividends that have not been declared prior to such payment date). Holders of the Series J will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received their full liquidation preference. 
 (b)  Partial Payment. If in any distribution described in Section 5(a) above the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay the Liquidation Preference (as defined below) in full to all holders of Series J and all holders of any stock of the Corporation ranking equally with the Series J as to such distribution, the amounts paid to the holders of Seri es J and to the holders of all such other stock shall be paid  pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate Liquidation Preference of the holders of Series J and the holders of all such other stock. In any such distribution, the " Liquidation Preference" of any holder of stock of the Corporation shall mean the amount otherwise payable to such holder in such distribution (assuming no limitation on the assets of the Corporation available for such distribution), including an amount equal to any declared but unpaid dividends (and, in the case of any holder of stock other than Series J and on which dividends accrue on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to any unpaid, accrued, cumulative dividends, whether or not declared, as applicable). Holders of the Series J will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received the full amounts provided for in this Section 5 and will have no right or claim to any of the Corporation's remaining  assets. 
 (c)  Residual Distributions. If the Liquidation Preference has been paid in full to all holders of Series J and any other shares of the Corporation's stock ranking equally as to the Liquidation Preference, the holders of other stock of the Corporation ranking junior as to the Liquidation Preference shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation (or proceeds there of) according to their respective rights and preferences. 
 (d)  Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 5, the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Series J receive cash, securities or other property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange (for cash, securities or other property) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. 
 6.  Redemption . 
 (a)  Optional Redemption. The Corporation may, at its option, redeem the Series J (i) in whole or in part, from time to time, on any Dividend Payment Date on or after July 15, 2020 or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within 90 days following a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event (as defined below), in each case upon notice given as provided in Section 6(c) below, at a redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, together with (except as otherwise provided herein below) any declared and unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. The redemption price for any shares of Series J shall be payable on the redemption date to the holder of such shares against surrender of the certificate(s) evidencing such shares to the Corporation or its agent. Any declared and unpaid dividend for the then current Dividend Period payable on a redemption date that occurs subsequent to the Dividend Record Date for a Dividend Period shall not be paid to the holder entitled to receive the redemption price on the redemption date, but rather shall be paid to the holder of record of the redeemed shares on such Dividend Record Date relating to the Dividend Payment Date as provided in Section 4 above. 
   
 7 
 
 
 A " Regulatory Capital Treatment Event" means the good faith determination by the Corporation that, as a result of (i) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States that is enacted or becomes effective after March 12, 2015, (ii) any proposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after March 12, 2015, or (iii) any official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws or regulations that is announced after March 12, 2015, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Corporation will not be entitled to treat the full liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share of Series J then outstanding as "Additional Tier 1" capital (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency) as then in effect and applicable, for so  long as any share of Series J is outstanding. " Appropriate federal banking agency" means the "appropriate federal banking agency" with respect to the Corporation as that term is defined in Section 3(q) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or any successor provi sion. 
 (b)  No Sinking Fund. The Series J will not be subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. Holders of Series J will have no right to require the redemption or repurc hase of any shares of Series J. 
 (c)  Notice of Redemption. Notice of every redemption of shares of Series J shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Subsection shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure to duly give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Series J designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series J. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the depositary shares representing interests in the Series J are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company or any other similar facility, notice of redemption may be given to the holders of Series J at such time and in any manner permitted by such facility. Each such notice given to a holder shall state: (1) the redemption date; (2) the number of shares of Series J to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (3) the redemption price; and (4) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surr endered for payment of the redemption price. 
 (d)  Partial Redemption. In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series J at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected either  pro rata or by lot. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Corporation shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series J shall be redeemed from time to time. If fewer than all the shares represented by any certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares without charge  to the holder thereof. 
 (e)  Effectiveness of Redemption. If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corp oration, separate and apart from its other funds, in trust for the  pro rata benefit of the holders of any shares of Series J so called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date dividends shall cease to 
   
 8 
 
 
accrue on all shares so called for redemption, all shares so called for redemption shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption, without interest. Any funds unclaimed at the end of two years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released to the Corporation, after which time the holders of the shares so called for redem ption shall look only to the Corporation for payment of the redemption price of such shares. 
 7.  Voting Rights . 
 (a)  General. The holders of Series J shall not have any voting rights except as set forth below and as determined by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof or as otherwise  from time to time required by law. 
 (b)  Right To Elect Two Directors Upon Nonpayment Events. If and whenever dividends on any shares of the Series J, or any other Voting Preferred Stock, shall have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend pay ments, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods (a " Nonpayment"), the holders of such shares, voting together as a class with holders of any and all other series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding, will be entitled to vote for the ele ction of a total of two additional members of the Board of Directors (the " Preferred Stock Directors "),  provided that the election of any such directors shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and  provided further that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors. In that event, the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically increase by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series J or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting. Such request to call a special meeting for the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors after a Nonpayment shall be made by written notice, signed by the requisite holders of Series J or other Voting Preferred Stock, and delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation in such manner as provided for in Section 9 below, or as may otherwise be required by law. The voting rights will continue until dividends on the shares of the Series J and any such series of Voting Preferred Stock shall have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of such dividends shall have been set aside for such payment) for at least four consecutive regular dividend periods following the Nonpayment. 
If and when dividends for at least four consecutive regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment have been fully paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for such payment shall have been set aside) on the Series J and any other class or series of Voting Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series J and all other holders of Voting Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each subsequent Nonpayment), the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically decrease by two. In determining whether dividends have been paid for at least four consecutive regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment, the Corporation may take account of any dividend it elects to pay for any dividend period after the regular dividend date for that period has passed. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series J together with all  series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting 
   
 9 
 
 
together as a single class) to the extent such holders have the voting rights described above. So long as a Nonpayment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the initial election after a Nonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series J and all Voting Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights described above  (voting together as a single class);  provided that the filling of each vacancy shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors. Any such vote to remove, or to fill a vacancy in the office of, a Preferred Stock Director may be taken only at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series J or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders). The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 (c)  Other Voting Rights. So long as any shares of Series J are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Series J and any Voting Preferred Stock at the time outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating: 
 (i)  Authorization of Senior Stock. Any amendment or alteration of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking senior to the Series J with respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon any liquid ation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; 
 (ii)  Amendment of Series J. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designation, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series J, taken as a whole; or 
 (iii)  Share Exchanges, Reclassifications, Mergers and Consolidations. Any consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series J, or of a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with another entity, unless in each case (x) the shares of Series J remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (y) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series J, taken as a whole; 
 provided ,  however, that for all purposes of this Section 7(c), any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series J, Series A, Series C, Series E, Series F, Series G, Series H or Series I, or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking equally with the 
   
 10 
 
 
Series J with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation will not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of, and will not require the affirmative vote or consent of, the h olders of outstanding shares of Series J. 
If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all other series of Voting Preferred Stock (including the Series J for this purpose), then only such series of Preferred Stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together as a class in lieu of all other series of Preferred Stock. If all series of a class of Preferred Stock are not equally affected by the proposed amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above, there shall be required a two-thirds approval of the class and a two-thirds  approval of each series that will have a diminished status. 
 (d)  Changes for Clarification. Without the consent of the holders of the Series J, so long as such action does not adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series J, the Corporation may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series J: 
(i) to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in this Certificate of Designation that may be defective or inconsistent; or 
(ii) to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series J that is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Certificate of Designation . 
 (e)  Changes after Provision for Redemption. No vote or consent of the holders of Series J shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b), (c) or (d) above if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which any such vote or consent would otherwise be required pursuant to such Section, all outstanding shares of Series J shall have been redeemed, or shall have been called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above. 
 (f)  Procedures for Voting and Consents. The rules and procedures for calling and conducting any meeting of the holders of Series J (including, without limitation, the fixing of a record date in connection therewith), the solicitation and use of proxies at such a meeting, the obtaining of written consents and any other aspect or matter with regard to such a meeting or such consents shall be governed by any rules the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may adopt from time to time, which rules and procedures shall conform to the requirements of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, applicable law and any national securities exchange or other trading facility on which the Series J is listed or traded at the time. Whether the vote or consent of the holders of a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series J and any Voting Preferred Stock has been cast or given on any matter on which the holders of shares of Series J are entitled to vote shall be determined by the Corporation by reference to the specified liquidation amounts  of the shares voted or covered by the consent. 
 8. Record Holders. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation and the transfer agent for the Series J may deem and treat the record holder of any share of Series J as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the Corporation nor such transfer agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. 
   
 11 
 
 
 9.  Notices. All notices or communications in respect of Series J shall be sufficiently given if given in writing and delivered in person or by first class mail, postage prepaid, or if given in such other manner as may be permitted in this Certificate of Designation, in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or by applicable law. 
 10.  No Preemptive Rights. No share of Series J shall have any rights of preemption whatsoever as to any securities of the Corporation, or any warrants, rights or options issued or granted with respect thereto, regardless of how such securities, or such warrants, rights or options, may be designated, issued or granted. 
 11.  Other Rights. The shares of Series J shall not have any voting powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other special rights, or qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, other than as set forth herein or in the Certificate of Incorporation or as provided by applicable law.

 4.  Dividends . 
 (a)  Rate. Holders of Series K will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law, non-cumulative cash dividends from the Original Issue Date (in the case of the initial Dividend Period only) or the immediately preceding Dividend Payment Date, quarterly in arrears on each Dividend Payment Date, commencing on April 15, 2017. These dividends will accrue on the liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share at a rate per annum equal to 5.850% with respect to each Dividend Period from and including the Original Issue Date to, but excluding, April 15, 2027 ( the " Fixed Rate Period") and at a rate per annum equal to the three-month U.S. dollar LIBOR on the related Dividend Determination Date plus 3.491% with respect to each Dividend Period from and including  April 15, 2027 (the " Floating Rate Period "). In the event that the Corporation 
   
 3 
 
 
issues additional shares of Series K after the Original Issue Date, dividends on such shares may accrue from the Original Issue Date or any other date specified by the Board of Dir ectors or an authorized committee thereof at the time such additional shares are issued. 
Dividends that are payable on Series K on any Dividend Payment Date will be payable to holders of record of Series K as they appear on the stock register of the Corporation on the  applicable record date, which shall be the 15 th calendar day before such Dividend Payment Date or such other record date fixed by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors that is not more  than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such Dividend Payment Date (each, a " Dividend Record Date "). 
 A " Dividend Period" is the period from and including a Dividend Payment Date to but excluding the next Dividend Payment Date or any earlier redemption date, except that (i) the initial Dividend Period for any share of Series K issued on the Original Issue Date will commence on and include the Original Issue Date of the Series K and will end on and exclude the April 15, 2017 Dividend Payment Date, and (ii) for any share of Series K issued after the Original Issue Date, the initial Dividend Period for such shares may commence on and include the Original Issue Date or such other date as the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors shall determine and publicly disclose and shall end on and exclude the next Dividend Payment Date. Dividends payable on the Series K for any Dividend Period during the Fixed Rate Period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dividends payable on the Series K for any Dividend Period during the Floating Rate Period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the Dividend Period. Dividends for the initial Dividend Period for shares of Series K issued on the Original Issue Date will be calculated from the Original Issue Date. If any scheduled Dividend Payment Date up to and including the April 15, 2027 scheduled Dividend Payment Date is not a Business Day, then the payment will be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional dividends will accrue as a result of that postponement. If any scheduled Dividend Payment Date thereafter is not a Business Day, then the Dividend Payment Date will be postponed to the next succeeding Business Day unless such day falls in the next calendar month, in which case the Dividend Payment Date will be brought forward to the immediately preceding day that is a Business Day, and, in either case, dividends will accrue to, but excluding, the date dividends are paid. 
For any Dividend Period during the Floating Rate Period, LIBOR (the London interbank offered rate) shall be determined by the Calculation Agent on the Dividend Determination Date i n the following manner: 
(i) LIBOR will be the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of three months, commencing on the first day of such Dividend Period, that appears on Reuters screen page "LIBOR01", or any successor page, at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Dividend Determination Date. 
(ii) If no such rate appears, then the Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of four major reference banks in the London interbank market, selected by the Calculation Agent as directed by the Corporation, to provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in U.S. dollars for a period of three months, commencing on the first day of such Dividend Period, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on that Dividend Determination Date 
   
 4 
 
 
and in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time. If at least two quotations are provided, LIBOR determined on that Dividend Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of those quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided, LIBOR will be determined for the first day of such Dividend Period as the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York time, on that Dividend Determination Date, by three major banks in New York City, selected by the Calculation Agent as directed by the Corporation, for loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks, for a period of three months, commencing on the first day of such Dividend Period, and in a principal amount that is representative of a single transaction in U.S. dollars in that market at that time. If the banks so selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as set forth above, LIBOR for that Dividend Determination Date will be the same as LIBOR for the immediately preceding Dividend Period, or, if there was no such  Dividend Period, the dividend payable will be based on the initial dividend rate. 
The Calculation Agent's determination of any dividend rate, and its calculation of the amount of dividends for any Dividend Period, will be on file at the Corporation's principal offices, will be made available to any stockholder upon request and will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error. 
 " Reuters " means Reuters 3000 Xtra Service or any successor service. 
Holders of Series K shall not be entitled to any dividends, whether payable in cash, securities or other property, other than dividends (if any) declared and payable on the Series K as specified in this Section 4 (subject to the other provisions of this Certificate of Designation). 
Dividends on shares of the Series K will not be cumulative. Accordingly, if the Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof) does not declare a dividend on the Series K payable in respect of any Dividend Period before the related Dividend Payment Date, such dividend will not accrue and the Corporation will have no obligation to pay a dividend for that Dividend Period on the Dividend Payment Date or at any future time, whether or not dividends on the Series K are declared for any future Dividend Period. 
 (b)  Priority of Dividends. The Series K will rank (i) senior to the Common Stock and any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be junior to the Series K, (ii) junior to any class or series of the Corporation's capital stock expressly stated to be senior to the Series K (issued with the requisite consent of the holders of the Series K, if required) and (iii) equally with the Series A, the Series C, the Series E, the Series F, the Series G, the Series H, the Series I, the Series J and each other class or series of Preferred Stock the Corporation may issue that is not expressly stated to be senior or junior to the Series K, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquid ation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. 
So long as any share of Series K remains outstanding, no dividend or distribution shall be paid or declared on Junior Stock, and no Junior Stock shall be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the Corporation, directly or indirectly, during a Dividend Period, unless the full dividend for the latest completed Dividend Period on all outstanding shares of Series K has been declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside). The foregoing limitation shall not apply to: 
   
 5 
 
 
   â€¢  repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of Junior Stock in connection with (1) any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of any one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants or (2) a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan; 
   
   â€¢  an exchange, redemption, reclassification or conversion of any class or series of Junior Stock, or any junior stock of a subsidiary of the Corporation, for any class or series of J unior Stock; 
   
   â€¢  the purchase of fractional interests in shares of Junior Stock under the conversion or exchange provisions of Junior Stock or the security being converted or exchanged; 
   
   â€¢  any declaration of a dividend in connection with any stockholders' rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any stockholders' rights plan, or the redem ption or repurchase of rights pursuant to the plan; or 
   
   â€¢  any dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other rights is the s ame stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or ranks equal or junior to that stock. 
 In addition, the foregoing limitation shall not restrict the ability of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, or any other affiliate of the Corporation, to engage in any market-making transactions in Junior Stock in the ordinary course of business. 
When dividends are not paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment thereof set aside) on any Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within a related Dividend Period) in full upon the Series K and any shares of Parity Stock, all dividends declared on the Series K and all such Parity Stock and payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within the related Dividend Period) shall be declared  pro rata so that the respective amounts of such dividends shall bear the same ratio to each other as all accrued but unpaid dividends per share on the Series K and all Parity Stock payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within t he related Dividend Period) bear to each other. 
Subject to the foregoing, dividends (payable in cash, securities or other property) may be determined by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors and may be declared and paid on the Common Stock and any stock ranking, as to dividends, equally with or junior to the Series K, from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment, and the Series K shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividends. 
 (c)  Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends. Dividends on the Series K will not be declared, paid or set aside for payment if the Corporation fails to comply, or if and to the extent such act would cause the Corporation to fail to comply, with applicable laws and regulations, including the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency) applicable to the Corporation. 
   
 6 
 
 
 5.  Liquidation Rights. 
 (a)  Voluntary or Involuntary Liquidation. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, holders of Series K shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof available for distribution to stockholders of the Corporation, after satisfaction of all liabilities to creditors, if any, of the Corporation and subject to the rights of holders of any shares of capital stock of the Corporation then outstanding ranking senior to or pari passu with the Series K in respect of distributions upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, and before any distribution of such assets or proceeds is made to or set aside for the holders of Common Stock and any other classes or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series K as to such distribution, a liquidating distribution in an amount equal to $25,000 per share, together with an amount equal to all dividends, if any, that have been declared but not paid prior to the date of payment of such distribution (but without any accumulation in respect of dividends that have not been declared prior to such payment date). Holders of the Series K will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received th eir full liquidation preference. 
 (b)  Partial Payment. If in any distribution described in Section 5(a) above the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay the Liquidation Preference (as defined below) in full to all holders of Series K and all holders of any stock of the Corporation ranking equally with the Series K as to such distribution, the amounts paid to the holders of Seri es K and to the holders of all such other stock shall be paid  pro rata in accordance with the respective aggregate Liquidation Preference of the holders of Series K and the holders of all such other stock. In any such distribution, the " Liquidation Preference" of any holder of stock of the Corporation shall mean the amount otherwise payable to such holder in such distribution (assuming no limitation on the assets of the Corporation available for such distribution), including an amount equal to any declared but unpaid dividends (and, in the case of any holder of stock other than Series K and on which dividends accrue on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to any unpaid, accrued, cumulative dividends, whether or not declared, as applicable). Holders of the Series K will not be entitled to any other amounts from the Corporation after they have received the full amounts provided for in this Section 5 and will have no right or claim to any of the Corporation's remaining  assets. 
 (c)  Residual Distributions. If the Liquidation Preference has been paid in full to all holders of Series K and any other shares of the Corporation's stock ranking equally as to the Liquidation Preference, the holders of other stock of the Corporation ranking junior as to the Liquidation Preference shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Corporation (or proceeds there of) according to their respective rights and preferences. 
 (d)  Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation. For purposes of this Section 5, the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into any other corporation or other entity, including a merger or consolidation in which the holders of Series K receive cash, securities or other property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange (for cash, securities or other property) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. 
   
 7 
 
 
 6.  Redemption. 
 (a)  Optional Redemption. The Corporation may, at its option, redeem the Series K (i) in whole or in part, from time to time, on any Dividend Payment Date on or after April 15, 2027 or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within 90 days following a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event (as defined below), in each case upon notice given as provided in Section 6(c) below, at a redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, together with (except as otherwise provided herein below) any declared and unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. The redemption price for any shares of Series K shall be payable on the redemption date to the holder of such shares against surrender of the certificate(s) evidencing such shares to the Corporation or its agent. Any declared and unpaid dividend for the then current Dividend Period payable on a redemption date that occurs subsequent to the Dividend Record Date for a Dividend Period shall not be paid to the holder entitled to receive the redemption price on the redemption date, but rather shall be paid to the holder of record of the redeemed shares on such Dividend Record Date relating to the Dividend Payment Date as provided in Section 4 above. 
 A " Regulatory Capital Treatment Event" means the good faith determination by the Corporation that, as a result of (i) any amendment to, or change in, the laws or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States that is enacted or becomes effective after January 24, 2017, (ii) any proposed change in those laws or regulations that is announced or becomes effective after January 24, 2017, or (iii) any official administrative decision or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws or regulations that is announced after January 24, 2017, there is more than an insubstantial risk that the Corporation will not be entitled to treat the full liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share of Series K then outstanding as "Additional Tier 1" capital (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board (or, as and if applicable, the capital adequacy guidelines or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency) as then in effect and applicable, f or so long as any share of Series K is outstanding. " Appropriate federal banking agency" means the "appropriate federal banking agency" with respect to the Corporation as that term is defined in Section 3(q) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or any successor provi sion. 
 (b)  No Sinking Fund. The Series K will not be subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. Holders of Series K will have no right to require the redemption or repurc hase of any shares of Series K. 
 (c)  Notice of Redemption. Notice of every redemption of shares of Series K shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the shares to be redeemed at their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Subsection shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice, but failure to duly give such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of Series K designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of Series K. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the depositary shares representing interests in the Series K are issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company or any other similar facility, notice of redemption may be given to the holders of Series K at such time and in any manner permitted by such facility.  Each such notice given to a holder shall state: (1) the redemption date; (2) the 
   
 8 
 
 
number of shares of Series K to be redeemed and, if less than all the shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be redeemed from such holder; (3) the redemption price; and (4) the place or places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price. 
 (d)  Partial Redemption. In case of any redemption of only part of the shares of Series K at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed shall be selected either  pro rata or by lot. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Corporation shall have full power and authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Series K shall be redeemed from time to time. If fewer than all the shares represented by any certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares without charge  to the holder thereof. 
 (e)  Effectiveness of Redemption. If notice of redemption has been duly given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all funds necessary for the redemption have been set aside by the Corp oration, separate and apart from its other funds, in trust for the  pro rata benefit of the holders of any shares of Series K so called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, then, notwithstanding that any certificate for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for cancellation, on and after the redemption date dividends shall cease to accrue on all shares so called for redemption, all shares so called for redemption shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such redemption, without interest. Any funds unclaimed at the end of two years from the redemption date shall, to the extent permitted by law, be released to the Corporation, after which time the holders of the shares so called for redemption shall look only to the Corporation for payme nt of the redemption price of such shares. 
 7.  Voting Rights. 
 (a)  General. The holders of Series K shall not have any voting rights except as set forth below and as determined by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof or as otherwise  from time to time required by law. 
 (b)  Right To Elect Two Directors Upon Nonpayment Events. If and whenever dividends on any shares of the Series K, or any other Voting Preferred Stock, shall have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend pay ments, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods (a " Nonpayment"), the holders of such shares, voting together as a class with holders of any and all other series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding, will be entitled to vote for the ele ction of a total of two additional members of the Board of Directors (the " Preferred Stock Directors "),  provided that the election of any such directors shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors and  provided further that the Board of Directors shall at no time include more than two Preferred Stock Directors. In that event, the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically increase by two, and the new directors shall be elected at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series K or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such el ection shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of 
   
 9 
 
 
stockholders), and at each subsequent annual meeting. Such request to call a special meeting for the initial election of the Preferred Stock Directors after a Nonpayment shall be made by written notice, signed by the requisite holders of Series K or other Voting Preferred Stock, and delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation in such manner as provided for in Section 9 below, or as may otherwise be required by law. The voting rights will continue until dividends on the shares of the Series K and any such series of Voting Preferred Stock shall have been fully paid for at least four consecutive regular dividend periods following the Nonpayment. 
If and when dividends for at least four consecutive regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment have been fully paid on the Series K and any other class or series of Voting Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series K and all other holders of Voting Preferred Stock shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each subsequent Nonpayment), the term of office of each Preferred Stock Director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors on the Board of Directors shall automatically decrease by two. In determining whether dividends have been paid for at least four consecutive regular dividend periods following a Nonpayment, the Corporation may take account of any dividend it elects to pay for any dividend period after the regular dividend date for that period has passed. Any Preferred Stock Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series K together with all series of Voting Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting together as a single class) to the extent such holders have the voting rights described above. So long as a Nonpayment shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Stock Director (other than prior to the initial election after a Nonpayment) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Stock Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series K and all Voting Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights described above (voting together as  a single class);  provided that the filling of each vacancy shall not cause the Corporation to violate the corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (or any other exchange on which the Corporation's securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of independent directors. Any such vote to remove, or to fill a vacancy in the office of, a Preferred Stock Director may be taken only at a special meeting called at the request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the Series K or of any other series of Voting Preferred Stock (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election shall be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders). The Preferred Stock Directors shall each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter. 
 (c)  Other Voting Rights. So long as any shares of Series K are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or consent of stockholders required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Series K and any Voting Preferred Stock at the time outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating: 
 (i)  Authorization of Senior Stock. Any amendment or alteration of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designation to authorize or create, or increase the authorized amount of, any shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation ranking senior to the Series K with respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon any liquid ation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; 
   
 10 
 
 
 (ii)  Amendment of Series K. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designation, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series K, taken as a whole; or 
 (iii)  Share Exchanges, Reclassifications, Mergers and Consolidations. Any consummation of a binding share exchange or reclassification involving the Series K, or of a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with another entity, unless in each case (x) the shares of Series K remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not the surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (y) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, taken as a whole, as are not materially less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series K, taken as a whole; 
 provided ,  however, that for all purposes of this Section 7(c), any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series K, Series A, Series C, Series E, Series F, Series G, Series H, Series I or Series J, or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of any other class or series of Preferred Stock ranking equally with the Series K with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such dividends are cumulative or non-cumulative) and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation will not be deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of, and will not require the affirmative vote or consent of, the holders of out standing shares of Series K. 
If any amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation specified in this Section 7(c) would adversely affect one or more but not all other series of Voting Preferred Stock (including the Series K for this purpose), then only such series of Preferred Stock as are adversely affected by and entitled to vote on the matter shall vote on the matter together as a class in lieu of all other series of Preferred Stock. If all series of a class of Preferred Stock are not equally affected by the proposed amendment, alteration, repeal, share exchange, reclassification, merger or consolidation described above, there shall be required a two-thirds approval of the class and a two-thirds  approval of each series that will have a diminished status. 
 (d)  Changes for Clarification. Without the consent of the holders of the Series K, so long as such action does not adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series K, the Corporation may amend, alter, supplement or repeal any terms of the Series K: 
(i) to cure any ambiguity, or to cure, correct or supplement any provision contained in this Certificate of Designation that may be defective or inconsistent; or 
   
 11 
 
 
(ii) to make any provision with respect to matters or questions arising with respect to the Series K that is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Certificate of Designation . 
 (e)  Changes after Provision for Redemption. No vote or consent of the holders of Series K shall be required pursuant to Section 7(b), (c) or (d) above if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which any such vote or consent would otherwise be required pursuant to such Section, all outstanding shares of Series K shall have been redeemed, or shall have been called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside for such redemption, in each case pursuant to Section 6 above. 
 (f)  Procedures for Voting and Consents. The rules and procedures for calling and conducting any meeting of the holders of Series K (including, without limitation, the fixing of a record date in connection therewith), the solicitation and use of proxies at such a meeting, the obtaining of written consents and any other aspect or matter with regard to such a meeting or such consents shall be governed by any rules the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may adopt from time to time, which rules and procedures shall conform to the requirements of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, applicable law and any national securities exchange or other trading facility on which the Series K is listed or traded at the time. Whether the vote or consent of the holders of a plurality, majority or other portion of the shares of Series K and any Voting Preferred Stock has been cast or given on any matter on which the holders of shares of Series K are entitled to vote shall be determined by the Corporation by reference to the specified liquidation amounts  of the shares voted or covered by the consent. 
 8.  Record Holders. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation and the transfer agent for the Series K may deem and treat the record holder of any share of Series K as the true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the Corporation nor such transfer agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. 
 9.  Notices. All notices or communications in respect of Series K shall be sufficiently given if given in writing and delivered in person or by first class mail, postage prepaid, or if given in such other manner as may be permitted in this Certificate of Designation, in the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or by applicable law. 
 10.  No Preemptive Rights. No share of Series K shall have any rights of preemption whatsoever as to any securities of the Corporation, or any warrants, rights or options issued or granted with respect thereto, regardless of how such securities, or such warrants, rights or options, may be designated, issued or granted. 
 11.  Other Rights. The shares of Series K shall not have any voting powers, preferences or relative, participating, optional or other special rights, or qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, other than as set forth herein or in the Certificate of Incorporation or as provided by applicable law.
