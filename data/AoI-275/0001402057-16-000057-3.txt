The Company may indemnify and advance expenses to any Person, as determined by the Member, by reason of the fact that such Person was an employee or agent of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a manager, director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, employee, agent or similar functionary of another foreign or domestic limited liability company, corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in such a capacity or arising out of his or her status as such a Person to the same extent that it shall indemnify and advance expenses to  Managers and officers under this   Article VIII .
