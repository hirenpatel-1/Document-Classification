The Company will give written notice of any impending Change in Control pursuant to subparagraph (b)(ii) hereof. Each such holder shall have fifteen (15) days (the "Notice Period" ) from the date of such notice to demand (by written notice mailed to the Company) redemption of all or any portion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock owned by such holder. If, by the expiration of the Notice Period, any holders have so elected to demand redemption, the Company shall give prompt written notice of such election (stating the total number of shares so demanded to be redeemed) to each other holder of Series A Preferred Stock within five (5) days after the expiration of the Notice Period.

At any time thereafter when additional funds of the Company become legally available for the redemption of Series A Preferred Stock, such funds shall immediately be used to redeem the balance of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock which the Company has become obligated to redeem pursuant to this subparagraph, but which it has not redeemed. If a person other than the Company is the surviving or resulting corporation in any Change in Control, such person shall redeem such shares of Series A Preferred Stock as provided in this subparagraph (b) (iii) (and the Company shall so provide in its agreements with such person relating to such Change in Control). Redemptions made pursuant to this subparagraph (b)(iii) shall not relieve the Company of its obligation to redeem Series A Preferred Stock on the Redemption Date as specified in subparagraph (a) above. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subparagraph (b)(iii), in no event shall the Company be under any obligation to redeem shares of Series A Preferred Stock, and the Company shall not effect such redemption, unless prior to such proposed redemption the Company shall either (i) cause an offer to be made to all lenders under the Credit Agreement to terminate all commitments, and repay all outstandings, thereunder, and to so terminate such commitments and repay such outstandings of any lenders accepting such offer to (ii) obtain the requisi te consents under the Credit Agreement to permit such redemption.

If such meeting shall not be called by the proper officer of the Company within twenty (20) days after personal service of said written request upon the Secretary of the Company, or within twenty (20) days after mailing the same within the United States by certified mail, addressed to the Secretary of the Company at its principal executive offices, then the holders of record of at least ten percent (10%) of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock may designate in writing one of their number to call such meeting at the expense of the Company, and such meeting may be called by the person so designated upon the notice required for the annual meetings of stockholders of the Company and shall be held at the place for holding the annual meetings of stockholders. Any holder of Series A Preferred Stock so designated shall  have access to the lists of stockholders to be called pursuant to the provisions hereof. 
   
(c) At any meeting held for the purpose of electing directors at which the holders of Series AJ Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to elect directors as aforesaid pursuant to subparagraph 6(a), the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of at least thirty-three and one-third percent (33-1/3%) of the outstanding Series  A Preferred Stock shall be required to constitute a quorum of such Series A Preferred Stock. 
   
(d)     Any vacancy occurring in the office of a director elected by the holders of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to subparagraph 6(a) shall be filled by the holders of Series A Preferred Stock. Any director to be elected by the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall agree, prior to his election to office, to resign upon the request of the respective holders of the Series A Preferred Stock which have the right hereunder to elect such director in the event of any termination of the right of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock to vote as a class for directors as herein provided, and upon any such termination the directors then in office elected by the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall forthwith resign. Unless otherwise required to resign as aforesaid, the term of office of the directors elected by the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall terminate upon the election  of their successors at any meeting of stockholders held for the purpose of electing directors. 
   
(e)     In any case in which the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote pursuant to this paragraph 6 or pursuant to law, each holder of Series A Preferred St ock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of Series A Preferred Stock held. 
   
(f)     (i) In addition to any other rights provided by applicable law, so long as any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Company shall not, without the affirmative vote, or the written consent as provided by law, of the holders of (A) at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately, create, authorize or issue any class or series of capital stock ranking either as to payment of dividends or distribution of assets upon liquidation prior to the Series A Preferred Stock; or (B) at least two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately, change the preferences, rights or powers with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock so as to affect the Preferred Stock adversely; but (except as otherwise required by applicable law) nothing herein contained shall require such a vote or consent (i) in connection with any increase in the total number of authorized shares of the Common Stock, or (ii) in connection with the authorization or increase of any class or series of shares ranking, as to dividends and in liquidation, junior to or on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock;  provided ,  however, that no such vote or written consent of the holders of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be required if, at or prior to the time when the issuance of any such shares ranking prior to the Series A Preferred Stock is to be made or any such change is to take effect, as the case may be, provision is made for the redemption of all the then outsta nding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock; and  provided   further, that this provision shall not in any way limit the right and power of the Company to issue its currently authorized but unissued shares or bonds, notes, mortgages, debentures, an d other obligations, and to incur indebtedness to banks and to other lenders. 
   
 
   
   
 
   
 
   
(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing subparagraph (f)(i), so long as there are 3,000 or more shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding, the Company will not, without the affirmative vote at a meeting or the written consent with or without a meeting of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, (1)(A) create, authorize or issue any class or series of capital stock ranking prior to or on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock (other than Common Stock) ei ther as to dividends or upon liquidation ( provided,   however, that the Company may issue capital stock ranking on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation  if   and   only   i f: all proceeds received by the Company from such offering of capital stock are used to redeem Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to paragraph 5(a) (ii) hereof) or to exchange any Series B Preferred Stock into the Company's 6- 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due March 15, 2003, (B) issue any debt securities that are convertible or exchangeable into an y equity security of the Company ( provided ,  however, that the Company may issue debt securities that are convertible or exchangeable into any equity security of the Company  if   and   only   if all proceeds received by the Company from such offering of debt securities are used to redeem Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to paragraph 5(a)(ii) hereof) or (C) transfer (other than pursuant to a pledge) any capital stock of Ethan Allen owned by the Company either beneficially or of record, or cause or permit Ethan Allen, as its sole stockholder, to issue any capital stock which is not owned beneficially and of record by the Company, (2) consolidate or merge with or into any other corporation (other than a merger of a wholly- owned subsidiary of the Company into the Company whereby the Company is the surviving corporation and in which no shares of Series A Preferred Stock are converted into or exchanged for any other securities or property and remain outstanding and unaffected), or liquidate, wind up or dissolve itself, or convey, sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of, all or any substantial or material part of its assets, or (3) amend, alter or repeal any of the provisions of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws so as to affect adve rsely the preferences, rights or powers of the Series A Preferred Stock;  provided,   however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or By- Laws which affects any of (C) the dividend rate set forth in paragraph 3 hereof or the date on which dividends are to be paid, (D) the conversion rate set forth in paragraph 7 hereof, (E) the Mandatory Redemption Date or Redemption Price, or (F) this subparagraph 6(f) (ii), in a manner adverse to the interests of holders of Series A Preferred Stock, shall only become effective upon the affirmative vote of all the outstanding share s of the Series A Preferred Stock. 
   
 7.      Conversion . The holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows: 
   
(a)     The shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the respective holders thereof, at any time prior to the close of business on the business day prior to a Redemption Date, at the office of the Company, into fully paid and nonassessable whole shares of Common Stock of the Company. One share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible into the number of shares of Common Stock, subject to adjustment as described below, equal to 42.735 ($23.40 per share). Upon conversion of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the Company shall pay on the date on which such shares are converted (the "Conversion Date"), out of funds legally available therefor, all accumulated and unpaid dividends on such Stock. The right to convert shares of Series A Preferred Stock called for redemption shall terminate at the close of business on the date fixed for redemption, unless default is made in payment of the Redemption Price or the Optional Redemption Price, as the case may be. 
   
(b)     Each conversion of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be effected by the surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares to be converted at the office of the Company, at any time during its usual business hours, together with written notice by the holder of such shares stating that such holder desires to convert the shares, or a stated number of the shares, represented by such certificate or certificates. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been effected as of the close of business on the date on which such certificate or certificates shall have been surrendered and such notice shall have been received, and, at such time, the rights of the holder as a holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall cease and the holder shall be deemed to have become the holder of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion. The Company will, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver to such holder certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled. 
   
(c)     No fractional shares of the Common Stock or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon conversion of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock. If more than one share of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares of the Common Stock which shall be issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock so surrendered. Instead of issuing any fractional shares of the Common Stock which would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable by the Company upon su ch conversion shall be rounded up to the nearest full share. 
   
 
   
   
 
   
 
   
(d)     The conversion rate in effect at any time shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: 
   
(i)     If the Company shall (1) pay a dividend in shares of the Common Stock to Holders of the Common Stock, (2) make a distribution in shares of the Common Stock to Holders of the Common Stock, (3) subdivide the outstanding shares of the Common Stock or (4) combine the outstanding shares of the Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of the Common Stock, then, and in any such case, the conversion rate in effect, immediately prior to such action, shall be adjusted so that the Holder of any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of the Common Stock that such Holder would have owned immediately following such action had such shares of the Series A Preferred Stock been converted immediately prior thereto. An adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph 7(d) (i) shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision or combination. 
   
(ii)     If the Company shall issue rights or warrants to all Holders of the Common Stock entitling them (for a period commencing no earlier than the record date for the determination of Holders of the Common Stock entitled to receive such rights or warrants and expiring not more than 45 days after such record date) to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock (or securities convertible into shares of the Common Stock) at a price per share less than the current market price (as determined pursuant to paragraph 7(a))iv)) of the Common Stock on such record date, then, and in any such case, the number of shares of the Common Stock into which each share of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible shall be adjusted so that the same shall be equal to the number determined by multiplying the number of shares of the Common Stock into which such share of the Series A Preferred Stock was convertible immediately prior to such record date by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of additional shares of the Common Stock offered (or into which the convertible securities so offered are convertible), and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding on such record date, plus the number of shares of the Common Stock which the aggregate offering price of the offered shares of the Common Stock (or the aggregate conversion price of the convertible securities so offered) would purchase at such current market price. Such adjustments shall become effective immedia tely after such record date. 
   
 
   
   
 
   
 
   
(iii)     If the Company shall distribute to all holders of the Common Stock shares of any class of capital stock other than the Common Stock, evidences of indebtedness or other assets (other than cash dividends paid out of consolidated current or retained earnings), or shall distribute to all Holders of the Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for securities (other than those referred to in paragraph 7(d) (ii)), then and in any such case, the number of shares of the Common Stock into which each share of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the number determined by multiplying the number of shares of the Common Stock into which such share of the Series A Preferred Stock was convertible immediately prior to the date of such distribution by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the current market price (determined as provided in paragraph 7(d) (iv)) of the Common Stock on the record date mentioned below, and of which the denominator shall be such current market price of the Common Stock, less the then fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive evidence of such fair market value) of the portion of the assets so distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants applicable to one share of the Common Stock. Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of the Holders of the Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Company shall distribute rights or warrant s (other than those referred to in paragraph 7(d) (ii)) ("Rights")  pro rata to Holders of the common Stock, the Company may, in lieu of making any adjustment pursuant to this paragraph 7(d) (iii), make proper provision so that each Holder of a share of Series A Preferred Stock who converts such share after the record date for such distribution and prior to the expiration or redemption of the Rights shall be entitled to receive upon such conversion, in addition to the conversion (the "Conversion Shares"), a number of Rights to be determined as follows: (i) if such conversion occurs on or prior to the date for the distribution to the Holders of Rights of separate certificates evidencing such Rights (the "Distribution Date"), the same number of Rights to which a Holder of a number of shares of the Common Stock equal to the number of Conversion Shares is entitled at the time of such conversion in accordance with the terms and provisions of and applicable to the Rights; and (ii) if such conversion occurs after the Distribution Date, the same number of Rights to which a Holder of the number of the Common Stock into which a share of the Series A Preferred Stock so converted was convertible immediately prior to the Distribution Date would have been entitled on the Distribution Date in accordance with the terms and provisi ons of and applicable to the Rights. 
   
(iv)     The current market price per share of the Common Stock on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices for the first twenty consecutive Trading Days commencing thirty Trading Days before the day in question. The closing price for each day shall be the last reported sales price for the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exch ange. 
   
(e)     The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available, out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock or out of shares of Common Stock held in its treasury, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the full number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon the conversion of all share s of Series A Preferred Stock from time to time outstanding. 
   
(f)     The Company shall pay any taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock. 
   
 (g)     If: 
   
   
 (1) 
 
the Company consolidates or merges with, or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation and stockholders of the Company must approve the transaction, o r 
 
   
   
 (2) 
 
 there is a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, 
 
   
then a Holder of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock may wish to convert some or all of such shares into shares of the Common Stock prior to the record date for, or the effective date of, the transaction so that he may receive the rights, warrants, securities or assets that a Holder of shares of the Common Stock on that date may receive. Therefore, the Company shall mail to Holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock a notice stating the proposed record or effective date, as the case may be. The Company shall mail the notice  at least 10 days before such date;  provided,   however, that failure to mail such notice or any defect therein shall not affect the validity of any transaction referred to in clause (1), (2) or (3) of this paragraph 7(g). 
   
 
   
   
 
   
 
   
(h)     If any of the following shall occur, namely: (i) any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination) , (ii) any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party other than a merger in which the Company is the successor corporation and which does not result in any reclassification of, or change (other than a change in name, or par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination) in, outstanding shares of the Common Stock or (iii) any transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the property or business of the Company as an entirety, then the Company, or such successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, shall, as a condition precedent to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, transfer or lease, provide in its certificate of incorporation or other charter document that each share of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of capital stock and other securities and property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, transfer or lease. Such certificate of incorporation or other charter document shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this paragraph 7 (h). If this paragraph 7(h) applies, then paragraph 7(d) (i) does not apply. The foregoing, however, shall not in any way affect the right a Holder of a share of the Series A Preferred Stock may otherwise have, pursuant to clause (ii) of the last sentence of paragraph 7(d) (iii), to receive Rights upon conversion of a share of the Series A Preferred Stock. If, in the case of any such consolidation, merger, transfer or lease, the stock or other securities and property (including cash) receivable thereupon by a holder of the Common Stock includes shares of capital stock or other securities and property of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such consolidation, merger, transfer or lease, then the certificate of incorporation or other charter document of such other corporation shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the Holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing. The provisions of this paragraph 7(h) shall similarly  apply to successive consolidations, mergers, transfers or leases. 
   
 8.      Exchange 
   
(a)     Upon any transfer of any share or share of Series A Preferred Stock (other than to a party who is already a beneficial and record holder of Series A Common Stock or any affiliate of such holder), each such share of Series A Preferred Stock shall, without any further action on the part of the Company or of any holder of capital stock of the Company, (i) be cancelled and cease to represent any ownership interest in the Company, and (ii) represent only the right to receive from the Company a like number of the Company's 6-1/2% Series B Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock (the "Series B Preferred Stock"), which shall be issued by the Company without charge upon the surrender to the Company of the certificates representing the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, as hereinafter described. Such certificates shall be surrendered at the principal office of the Company (or such other office or agency of the Company as the Company may designate by notice in writing to the holder or holders of Series A Preferred Stock) at any time during its usual business hours, which notice shall also state the name or names (with addresses) and denominations in which the certificate or certificates for Series B Preferred Stock shall be issued and shall include instructions for delivery thereof. Upon such surrender, the Company shall issue and deliver in accordance with such instructions the certificate or certificates for the Series B Preferred Stock issuable upon such exchange. To the extent permitted by law, such exchange shall be deemed to have been effected as of the close of business on the date on wh ich such certificate or certificates shall have been surrendered. 
   
(b)     Shares of Series A Preferred Stock which are exchanged into shares of Series B Preferred Stock as provided herein shall not be reissued. 
   
 
   
   
 
   
 
   
(c)     The Company will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Series B Preferred Stock or its treasury shares of such Stock, solely for the purpose of issue upon the exchange of the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in this paragraph 8, such number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock as shall then be issuable upon the exchange of all the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The Company covenants that all shares of Series B Preferred Stock which shall be so issuable shall, when issued, be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non- assessable, free of any preemptive rights. The Company will use reasonable efforts to take all such action as may be necessary to assure that all such shares of Series B Preferred Stock may be so issued without violation of any applicable law or regulation or any requirements of any domestic  stock exchange upon which shares of Series B Preferred Stock may be listed. 
   
(d)     The issuance of certificates for shares of Series B Preferred Stock upon exchange of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be made without charge to the holders of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock for any issuance tax in respect thereof, or other cost incurred by the Company in connection with such exchange and the related issuance of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, provided that the Company shall not be required to pay any such tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any certificate in a name other than that of the holder of the Series A Preferred Stock exchanged. The Company will not take any action which would cause the total number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock issuable upon exchange of the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding, together with the total number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding and the total number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock reserved for issuance upon exchange of Series A Preferred Stock to exceed the total number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock then authorized hereunder. The Company will not close its books against the transfer of any share of Series A Preferred Stock or of any share of Series B Preferred Stock issued or issuable upon the conversion of such shares in any manner which interferes with the timely conversion of such shares. 
   
 9.      No Reissuance of Preferred Stock. No Series A Preferred Stock acquired by the Company by reason of redemption, purchase, or otherwise shall be reissued, and all such shares shall be cancelled, retired and elimina ted from the shares which the Company shall be authorized to issue. 
   
 10.      Ranking. With regard to rights to receive dividends and distributions upon dissolution of the Company, the Series A Preferred Stock shall rank prior to the Common Stock and any other capital stock of the Company, other than the 6 ½% Series B Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock of the Company, with which it shall rank on a parity. 
   
 11.      Notices. All notices to the Company permitted hereunder shall be personally delivered or sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to its principal office located at Ethan Allen Drive, Danbury, Connecticut 06811, or to such other address at which its principal office is located and as to which notice thereof is similarly given to the holders of the Serie s A Preferred Stock at their addresses appearing on the books of the Company. 
   
 12.      Certain Tax Matters . 
   
(a)     The parties hereto intend that (i) the Series A Preferred Stock shall be treated as equity for Federal, state and local income tax purposes, (ii) the dividends paid or deemed paid with respect thereto and any amount in respect of accumulated and unpaid dividends (collectively referred to herein as "Dividends") shall be treated as dividends for Federal, state and local income tax purposes, and (iii) the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the dividends received deduction provided by Section 243(a) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") as in effect on the date hereof or any successor provision and any similar or corresponding state or local law ("Dividends Received Deduction") with respect to the Dividends. In accordance with such intent, the Company agrees that, except to the extent otherwise required (i) by reason of the application of Section 30l(c)(2) or (c)(3) of the Code, (ii) pursuant to a Final Determination (as defined below), or (iii) as a result of a good faith determination based upon a written opinion (a copy of which shall be delivered to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock) of independent tax counsel reasonably acceptable to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock that there is not a valid reporting position under applicable law, neither it nor any affiliate, directly or indirectly, will take any action or file any returns or other documents inconsistent with such intent. For purposes of this subparagraph 12(a), a "Final Determination" with respect to a federal tax liability shall mean (1) a decision, judgement, decree or other order by any court of competent jurisdiction, which decision, judgment, decree or other order has become final, or (2) a closing agreement entered into under Section 7121 (or any successor to such Section) of the Code or any other settlement agreement entered into in connection with an administrative or judicial proceeding and consented to by the holders of Series A Preferred Stock or any member of any holder of Series A Preferred Stock's respective consolidated groups. 
   
 
   
   
 
   
 
   
(b)     If at any time, for any reason or under any circumstances (including a change in law), (i) a holder of Series A Preferred Stock (or the affiliated group of which such holder of Series A Preferred Stock is a member) loses the right to claim, does not claim (as the result of a good faith determination based upon a written opinion of independent tax counsel of such holder of Series A Preferred Stock' s independent tax counsel (a copy of which shall be delivered to the Company) that such claim is not properly allowable or there shall be disallowed all or any portion of the Dividends Received Deduction with respect to the Dividends, (ii) the Dividends Received Deduction shall be reduced below 80% in the case of a holder of Series A Preferred Stock owning at least 20% or more (by vote and value) of the stock of the Company (within the meaning of Section 243 of the Code) or 70% in other cases or shall be otherwise limited or eliminated or (iii) a holder of Series A Preferred Stock' s tax basis in the Series A Preferred Stock shall be subject to reduction by reason of the receipt or accrual of any Dividend or the availability of the Dividends Received Deduction including, without limitation, by reason of the treatment of any indemnity payment hereunder as a dividend (in each case, a "Loss"), then with respect to a particular holder of Series A Preferred Stock, unless such Loss arises solely by reason of the act or failure to act of such holder of Series A Preferred Stock or by reason of a Code provision which limits the availability of the Dividends Received Deduction based on the tax characteristics of such holder of Series A Preferred Stock, including such holder of Series A Preferred Stock incurring "portfolio indebtedness" within the meaning of Section 246A (d)(3) of the Code, such holder of Series A Preferred Stock's failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 246(c) of the Code, or such holder of Series A Preferred Stock's Dividends Received Deduction being limited by reason of the application of Section 246(b) of the Code, the Company shall pay to such holder of Series A Preferred Stock, no later than 10 days after the Notice Date, an amount which will on an After-Tax Basis equal (x) (A) in the case of a Loss described in clauses (i) or (ii) hereof, the excess of (1) the aggregate Federal, state and local income tax paid or payable by the holder of Series A Preferred Stock with respect to such Dividend in its taxable year in which the Dividend is taxable to the holder of Series A Preferred Stock over (2) the Federal, state and local income tax which would have been payable by the holder of Series A Preferred Stock in such taxable year if such Loss had not occurred, or (B) in the case of a Loss described in clause (iii) hereof, the excess of (1) the aggregate Federal, state and local income tax paid or payable by the holder of Series A Preferred Stock with respect to all Dividends paid on the Series A Preferred Stock during all taxable years in which the holder of Series A Preferred Stock held such Series A Preferred Stock and with respect to the disposition of such Series A Preferred Stock over (2) the aggregate Federal, state and local income tax that would have been payable by the holder of Series A Preferred Stock in all such taxable years with respect to such Dividends and such disposition if such Loss had not occurred and (y) any interest, penalties or additions to tax actually payable by the holder of Series A Preferred Stock to the Internal Revenue Service or any other applicable taxing authority by reason of such events. The calculation required under the preceding sentence shall be made assuming that the holder of Series A Preferred Stock pays taxes at the highest marginal Federal, state and  local income tax rates in effect during such year. 
   
(c)     For purposes of this paragraph 12, an amount paid on an "After-Tax Basis" shall mean an amount which, after reduction by the increase in Federal, state and local income taxes payable by the recipient thereto, calculated using the highest marginal rates in effect at the time of such payment, shall equal the amount in respect of which such amount is paid. "Notice Date" shall be the date on which the holder of Series A Preferred Stock gives notice (a "Notice" ) to the Company of a Loss, which Notice shall state the nature of the Loss and the claim for indemnity and shall provide a computation of the indemnity payable to the holder of Series A Preferred Stock but in no event more than 30 days prior to the earlier of (i) the filing of a return (including an estimated tax return) or the acceptance of an audit report or closing agreement in which such Loss is reflected, (ii) the payment of any additional Federal, state or local income taxes as a result of such Loss or (iii) in the case of a Loss described in clause (iii) of subparagraph 12(b), the disposition of  the Series A Preferred Stock. 
   
 
   
   
 
   
 
   
(d)     If the Internal Revenue Service should propose an adjustment to a holder of Series A Preferred Stock's Federal income tax that would constitute a Loss, the holder of Series A Preferred Stock will notify the Company and the other holder of Series A Preferred Stock. The holder of Series A Preferred Stock for whom such adjustment shall have been proposed shall have exclusive control and responsibility to conduct any audit, examination, proceeding or litigation (a "Contest") with respect thereto;  provided,   however, that if the Company reasonably so requests, such holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall contest, at the Company's expense, such proposed adjustment at the audit level and thereafter such holder's of Series A Preferred Stock sole obligation shall be to keep the Company duly informed of the progress thereof. If, in the course of contesting any claims referred to in this subparagraph 12(d), the Internal Revenue Service shall advise the holder of Series A Preferred Stock that it is willing to agree to a settlement of such claim, the holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall notify the Company of such settlement proposal and, if, after receipt of such notice, the Company so requests, and provided such settlement will not have any adverse effect on the holder of Series A Preferred Stock, the holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall agree to the settlement as proposed by the Internal Revenue Service and described to the Company. The holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall keep the Company (and the other holder of Series A Preferred Stock) informed with respect to the Contest. Any failure of the holder of Series A Preferred Stock to notify or to keep the Company (or the other holder of Series A Preferred Stock) informed concerning a Contest shall not affect the Company's obligation to indemnify the holder of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to this paragraph 12. The Company will cooperate with the holder of Series A Preferred Stock as the holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall reasonably request in any Contest. The Company shall indemnify the holder of Series A Preferred Stock, on an After-Tax  Basis, for all costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith. 
   
(e)     The Company agrees that if a Loss has occurred pursuant to subparagraph 12(b) and payments of the indemnity shall not have been timely made to a holder of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to subparagraph 12(b), then, until such payments have been made in full to such holder of Series A Preferred Stock, such amounts shall bear interest, calculated daily on the basis of a 360-day year, at a rate equal to the Index Rate plus 4% per annum, until paid in full.

Any such meeting shall be held at the earliest practicable date at the place for the holding of the annual meetings of stockholders. If such meeting shall not be called by the proper officer of the Company within twenty (20) days after personal service of said written request upon the Secretary of the Company, or within twenty (20) days after mailing the same within the United States by certified mail, addressed to the Secretary of the Company at its principal executive offices, then the holders of record of at least ten percent (10%) of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock may designate in writing one of their number to call such meeting at the expense of the Company, and such meeting may be called by the person so designated upon the notice required for the annual meetings of stockholders of the Company and shall be held at the place for holding the annual meetings of stockholders. Any holder of Series B Preferred Stock so designated shall have access to the lists of stockholders to be called pursuant to the provisions hereof. 
   
(c)     At any meeting held for the purpose of electing directors at which the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to elect directors as aforesaid, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of at least thirty-three and one-third percent (33-1/3%) of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock shall be  required to constitute a quorum of such Series B Preferred Stock.

(e)     In any case in which the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote pursuant to this paragraph 6 or pursuant to law, each holder of Series B Preferred St ock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of Series B Preferred Stock held. 
   
(f)     In addition to any other rights provided by applicable law, so long as any shares of the Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Company shall not, without the affirmative vote, or the written consent as provided by law, of the holders of (A) at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, voting separately, create, authorize or issue any class or series of capital stock ranking either as to payment of dividends or distribution of assets upon liquidation prior to the Series B Preferred Stock; or (B) at least two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of the series B Preferred Stock, voting separately, change the preferences, rights or powers with respect to the series B Preferred Stock so as to affect the Preferred Stock adversely; but (except as otherwise required by applicable law) nothing herein contained shall require such a vote or consent (i) in connection with any increase in the total number of authorized shares of the Common Stock, or (ii) in connection with the authorization or increase of any class or series of shares ranking, as to dividends and in liquidation, junior to or on a parity with the Series B Preferred Stock;  provided,   however, that no such vote or written consent of the holders of the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be required if, at or prior to the time when the issuance of any such shares ranking prior to the Series B Preferred Stock is to be made or any such change is to take effect, as the case may be, provision is made for the redemption of all the then outsta nding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock; and  provided   further, that this provision shall not in any way limit the right and power of the Company to issue its currently authorized but unissued shares or bonds, notes, mortgages, debentures, an d other obligations, and to incur indebtedness to banks and to other lenders . 
   
 
   
   
 
   
 
   
 7.      Conversion . The holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows: 
   
(a)     The shares of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the respective holders thereof, at any time prior to the close of business on the business day prior to a Redemption Date, at the office of the Company, into fully paid and nonassessable whole shares of Common Stock of the Company. One share of series B Preferred Stock shall be convertible into the number of shares of Common Stock, subject to adjustment as described below, equal to 42.735. Upon conversion of any shares of Series B Preferred Stock, the Company shall pay on the date on which such shares are converted (the "Conversion Date"), out of funds legally available therefor, all accumulated and unpaid dividends on such Stock. The right to convert shares of Series B Preferred Stock called for redemption shall terminate at the close of business on the date fixed for redemption, unless default is  made in payment of the Redemption Price or the Optional Redemption Price, as the case may be. 
   
(b)     Each conversion of shares of the series B Preferred Stock shall be effected by the surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares to be converted at the office of the Company, at any time during its usual business hours, together with written notice by the holder of such shares stating that such holder desires to convert the shares, or a stated number of the shares, represented by such certificate or certificates. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been effected as of the close of business on the date on which such certificate or certificates shall have been surrendered and such notice shall have been received, and, at such time, the rights of the holder as a holder of series B Preferred stock shall cease and the holder shall be deemed to have become the holder of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion. The Company will, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver to such holder certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock to which such holder shall be entitled. 
   
(c)     No fractional shares of the Common Stock or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon conversion of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock. If more than one share of the series B Preferred Stock shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares of the Common Stock which shall be issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock so surrendered. Instead of issuing any fractional shares of the Common Stock which would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of any shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable by the Company upon su ch conversion shall be rounded up to the nearest full share. 
   
(d)     The conversion rate in effect at any time shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: 
   
 
   
   
 
   
 
   
(i)     If the Company shall (1) pay a dividend in shares of the Common Stock to Holders of the Common Stock, (2) make a distribution in shares of the Common Stock to Holders of the Common Stock, (3) subdivide the outstanding shares of the Common Stock or (4) combine the outstanding shares of the Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of the Common Stock, then, and in any such case, the conversion rate in effect, immediately prior to such action, shall be adjusted so that the Holder of any shares of the Series B Preferred Stock thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of the Common Stock that such Holder would have owned immediately following such action had such shares of the Series B Preferred stock been converted immediately prior thereto. An adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph 7(d) (i) shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision or combination. 
   
(ii)     If the Company shall issue rights or warrants to all Holders of the Common Stock entitling them (for a period commencing no earlier than the record date for the determination of Holders of the Common Stock entitled to receive such rights or warrants and expiring not more than 45 days after such record date) to subscribe for or purchase shares of the Common Stock (or securities convertible into shares of the Common Stock) at a price per share less than the current market price (as determined pursuant to paragraph 7(a))iv)) of the Common Stock on such record date, then, and in any such case, the number of shares of the common Stock into which each share of the series B Preferred Stock shall be convertible shall be adjusted so that the same shall be equal to the number determined by multiplying the number of shares of the Common Stock into which such share of the series B Preferred Stock was convertible immediately prior to such record date by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of additional shares of the Common Stock offered (or into which the convertible securities so offered are convertible), and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding on such record date, plus the number of shares of the Common Stock which the aggregate offering price of the offered shares of the Common Stock (or the aggregate conversion price of the convertible securities so offered) would purchase at such current market price. Such adjustments shall become effective immedia tely after such record date. 
   
(iii)     If the company shall distribute to all holders of the Common Stock shares of any class of capital stock other than the Common Stock, evidences of indebtedness or other assets (other than cash dividends paid out of consolidated current or retained earnings), or shall distribute to all Holders of the Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for securities (other than those referred to in paragraph 7(d) (ii)), then and in any such case, the number of shares of the Common Stock into which each share of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be convertible shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the number determined by multiplying the number of shares of the Common Stock into which such share of the Series B Preferred Stock was convertible immediately prior to the date of such distribution by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the current market price (determined as provided in paragraph 7(d)(iv)) of the Common Stock on the record date mentioned below, and of which the denominator shall be such current market price of the Common Stock, less the then fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive evidence of such fair market value) of the portion of the assets so distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants applicable to one share of the Common Stock. Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of the Holders of the Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Company shall distribute rights or warrants (other than those referred to in paragraph 7(d) (ii)) ("Rights") pro rata to Holders of the Common Stock, the Company may, in lieu of making any adjustment pursuant to this paragraph 7(d) (iii), make proper provision so that each Holder of a share of Series B Preferred stock who converts such share after the record date for such distribution and prior to the expiration or redemption of the Rights shall be entitled to receive upon such conversion, in addition to the conversion (the "Conversion Shares"), a number of Rights to be determined as follows: (i) if such conversion occurs on or prior to the date for the distribution to the Holders of Rights of separate certificates evidencing such Rights (the "Distribution Date"), the same number of Rights to which a Holder of a number of shares of the Common Stock equal to the number of Conversion Shares is entitled at the time of such conversion in accordance with the terms and provisions of and applicable to the Rights; and (ii) if such conversion occurs after the Distribution Date, the same number of Rights to which a Holder of the number of the Common Stock into which a share of the Series B Preferred stock so converted was convertible immediately prior to the Distribution Date would have been entitled on the Distribution Date in accordance with the terms and provisions of and applicable to the Rights . 
   
 
   
   
 
   
 
   
(iv)      The current market price per share of the Common Stock on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices for the first twenty consecutive Trading Days commencing thirty Trading Days before the day in question. The closing price for each day shall be the last reported sales price for the Common stock on the New York Stock Exc hange. 
   
(e)     The company shall at all times reserve and keep available, out of its authorized but unissued shares of common stock or out of shares of Common Stock held in its treasury, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock, the full number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon the conversion of all share s of Series B Preferred Stock from time to time outstanding. 
   
(f)     The Company shall pay any taxes that may be payable in respect of any issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion of shares of Series B Preferred Stock. 
   
 (g)     If: 
   
(1)     the Company consolidates or merges with, or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation and stockholders of the Company must approve the transa ction, or 
   
 (2)     there is a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, 
   
then a Holder of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock may wish to convert some or all of such shares into shares of the Common Stock prior to the record date for, or the effective date of, the transaction so that he may receive the rights, warrants, securities or assets that a Holder of shares of the Common Stock on that date may receive. Therefore, the Company shall mail to Holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock a notice stating the proposed record or effective date, as the case may be. The Company shall mail the notice at least 10 days before such date; provided, however, that failure to mail such notice or any defect therein shall not affect the validity of any transaction referred to in clause  (1), (2) or (3) of this paragraph 7(g). 
   
 
   
   
 
   
 
   
(h)     If any of the following shall occur, namely: (i) any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination), (ii) any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party other than a merger in which the Company is the successor corporation and which does not result in any reclassification of, or change (other than a change in name, or par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination) in, outstanding shares of the Common Stock or (iii) any transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the property or business of the Company as an entirety, then the Company, or such successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, shall, as a condition precedent to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, transfer or lease, provide in its certificate of incorporation or other charter document that each share of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of capital stock and other securities and property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, transfer or lease. Such certificate of incorporation or other charter document shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this paragraph 7(h). If this paragraph 7(h) applies, then paragraph 7 (d) (i) does not apply. The foregoing, however, shall not in any way affect the right a Holder of a share of the Series B Preferred Stock may otherwise have, pursuant to clause (ii) of the last sentence of paragraph 7(d) (iii), to receive Rights upon conversion of a share of the Series B Preferred Stock. If, in the case of any such consolidation, merger, transfer or lease, the stock or other securities and property (including cash) receivable thereupon by a holder of the Common Stock includes shares of capital stock or other securities and property of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such consolidation, merger, transfer or lease, then the certificate of incorporation or other charter document of such other corporation shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the Holders of shares of the series B Preferred Stock as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing. The provisions of this paragraph 7(h) shall similarly a pply to successive consolidations, mergers, transfers or leases. 
   
   
 8.      Exchange 
   
(a)     The Company shall have the option on any Dividend Payment Date to exchange all or any portion of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding on such Dividend Payment Date into the Company's 6 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due March 15, 2003 (the "Notes") to be issued pursuant to an indenture (the "Indenture") substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, in the amount of $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each share of Series B Preferred Stock ; provided, however, that no such exchange may be consummated unless full cumulative dividends (including, without duplication, full cumulative dividends  pro   rata for the elapsed portion of the current dividend period) on the Series B Preferred Stock to the date of exchange shall have been paid. Such exchange may be made only if, at the time of the exchange (i) the Indenture shall have been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, (ii) there shall be no dividend arrearage (including the dividend payable on the date of exchange) on the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, and (iii) no Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) under the Indenture shall have occurred and be continuing. Notes shall be issued only in integral multiples of $1,000 at the time of exchange. If any additional amounts ("Fractional Principal Amounts") would otherwise be issuable to any Holder of Series B Preferred Stock, then the Company shall, in lieu of issuing a Fractional Principal Amount therefor, issue, in full payment of the Company's obligation with respect to such Fractional Principal Amounts, Notes equal to the aggregate of such Fractional Principal Amounts (rounded upwards to the nearest principal amount which is an integral multiple of $1,000) to an agent (the "Agent") appointed by the Company for the sale thereby. The Agent will remit promptly to the Holders of Fractional Principal Amounts their proportionate interest in the net proceeds (following deduction of applicable transaction costs) from any such sale. 
   
 
   
   
 
   
 
   
(b)     Any exchange pursuant to this paragraph 8 shall be made upon not less than 30 days' notice prior to the date fixed for exchange (the "Exchange Date"). The notice given shall state that, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates to the Company, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock will receive Notes in the amount set forth in subparagraph 8(a) above and that, at the close of business on the Exchange Date, all rights of the holders with respect to such shares so called for exchange shall cease, except the right to receive the Notes in the amount set forth in subparagraph 8(a) above. Prior to giving the first notice of intention to exchange, the Company shall execute and deliver to a bank or trust company selected by the Company, and qualify under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, the Indenture in substantially the form filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement with such changes as may be required by law or usage. Except as may be otherwise required by applicable law, the form of the Indenture may only be amended or supplemented before the first Exchange Date which occurs with the affirmative vote or consent of the Holders of two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, except for those changes which would not adversely affect the legal rights of the Holders. On or after such first Exchange Date, the Indenture may only be amended or supplemented as provided in the Indenture. The Company will cause the Notes to be authenticated on the dividend payment date on which the relevant exchange is effective, and the Company will pay interest on the Notes at the rate and on the dates specified in such Indenture from and after the relevant Exchange Date. The Company shall not be required to declare or pay, and the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to receive, any dividends on such Series B Preferred Stock in addition to the full cumulative dividends paid on the Serie s B Preferred Stock to the Exchange Date pursuant to subparagraph 8(a) hereof. 
   
 9.      Ranking. With regard to rights to receive dividends and distributions upon dissolution of the Company, the Series B Preferred stock shall rank prior to the Common Stock and any other capital stock of the Company other than the 6-1/2% Series A Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock of the Company, with which it shall rank on a parity. 
   
 10.      Notices. All notices to the Company permitted hereunder shall be personally delivered or sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to its principal office located at Ethan Allen Drive, Danbury, Connecticut 06811, or to such other address at which its principal office is located and as to which notice thereof is similarly given to the holders of the Serie s B Preferred Stock at their addresses appearing on the books of the Company.

If less than all of the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall, not more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, select the Securities to be redeemed pro rata or by a method that complies with applicable legal and stock exchange requirements, if any. The Trustee shall make the selection from the Securities outstanding and not previously called for redemption. Securities in denominations of $1,000 may only be redeemed in whole. The Trustee may select for redemption portions (equal to $1,000 or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal of Securities that have denominations larger than $1,000.

(7)     that Holders who wish to convert Securities must satisfy the requirements in paragraph 7 of the Securities; 
   
(8)     that, unless the Company defaults in making the redemption payment, interest on Securities called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the redemption date, whereupon the only remaining right of the Holder is to receive payment of the redemption price upon surrender to the Paying Agent of the Securities; 
   
(9)     if any Security is being redeemed in part, the portion of the principal amount of such Security to be redeemed and that, after the redemption date, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued; and 
   
 (10)     the CUSIP number, if any, of the Securities to be redeemed.

 13 
 
   
 
   
If the Company complies with the preceding paragraph, interest on the Securities to be redeemed will cease to accrue on the applicable redemption date, whether or not such Securities are presented for payment. If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender for redemption because of the failure of the Company to comply with the preceding paragraph, interest will be paid on the unpaid principal from the redemption date until such principal is paid and, to the extent lawful, on any interest not paid on such unp aid principal, in each case at the rate provided in the Securities and in Section 6.01.

As soon as practicable after the conversion date, the Company shall deliver to the Holder through the Conversion Agent a certificate for the number of whole shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion. The person in whose name the certificate is registered shall become the stockholder of record on the conversion date, and, as of such date, such  person's rights as a Securityholder shall cease. 
   
No payment or adjustment will be made for accrued interest on a converted Security or for dividends or distribution on shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of a Security, but if any Holder surrenders a Security for conversion after the close of business on the record date for the payment of an installment of interest and prior to the opening of business on the next interest payment date, then, notwithstanding such conversion, the interest payable on such interest payment date shall be paid to the Holder of such Security on such record date. In such event, such Security, when surrendered for conversion, must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest payable on such interest payment date on the portion so converted. If such payment does not accompany such Security, the Security shall not be converted. If the Company defaults in the payment of interest payable on  the interest payment date, the Trustee shall repay such funds to the Holder. 
   
If a Holder converts more than one Security at the same time, the number of whole shares issuable upon the conversion shall be based on the total principal amount of Securities con verted. 
   
Upon surrender of a Security that is converted in part, the Company shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate for the Holder a new Security equal in principal amount to the un converted portion of the Security surrendered. 
   
If the last day on which a Security may be converted is a Legal Holiday in a place where a Conversion Agent is located, the Security may be surrendered to that Conversion Agent on  the next succeeding day that is not a Legal Holiday. 
   
 
 SECTION 4.03 
 
 Fractional Shares. 
 
   
The Company will not issue fractional shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Securities. In lieu thereof, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable by the Company upon such  conversion shall be rounded up to the nearest full share.

 SECTION 4.04 
 
 Taxes on Conversion. 
 
   
The issuance of certificates for shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of any Security shall be made without charge to the converting Securityholder for such certificates or any tax in respect of the issuance of such certificates, and such certificates shall be issued in the name of, or in such name or names as may be directed by. the Holder of the Security converted; provided, however, that in the event that certificates for shares of Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than the name of the Holder of the Security converted, such Security, when surrendered for conversion, shall be accompanied by an instrument of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company, duly executed by the registered Holder thereof or his duly authorized attorney; and provided further, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such certificates in a name other than that of the Holder of the Security converted, and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such certificates unless or until the person or persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the sat isfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. 
   
 
 SECTION 4.05 
 
 Company to Provide Stock. 
 
   
The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of issuance upon conversion of Securities as herein provided, a number of shares of Common Stock sufficient to permit the conversion of all outstanding Securities. 
   
All shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon conversion of the Securities shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable when so issued. 
   
 
 SECTION 4.06 
 
 Adjustment of Conversion Price. 
 
   
The conversion price (herein called the "Conversion Price") shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows: 
   
(a)     If the Company shall (1) pay a dividend in shares of Common Stock to holders of Common Stock. (2) make a distribution in shares of Common Stock to holders of Common Stock, (3) subdivide its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock or (4) combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, then, and in any such case, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such action shall be adjusted so that the Holder of any Security thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of Common Stock that such Holder would have owned immediately following such action had such Securities been converted immediately prior thereto. An adjustment made pursuant to this subsection (a) shall become effective immediately after the record date in the case of a dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision or combination. 
   
 
   
 16 
 
   
 
   
(b)     If the Company shall issue rights or warrants to all holders of Common Stock entitling them (for a period commencing no earlier than the record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such rights or warrants and expiring not more than 45 days after such record date) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock) at a price per share less than the current market price (as determined pursuant to subsection (d) below) of the Common Stock on such record date, then, and in any such case, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate offering price of the offered shares of Common Stock (or the aggregate conversion price of the convertible securities so offered) would purchase at such current market price, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock offered (or into which the convertible securities so offered are convertible). Such adjustments shall become effective immediately after such record date. 
   
(c)     If the Company shall distribute to all holders of Common Stock shares of any class of capital stock other than Common Stock, evidences of indebtedness or other assets (other than cash dividends paid out of consolidated current or retained earnings), or shall distribute to all holders of Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for securities (other than those referred to in subsection (b) above), then, and in any such case, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the date of such distribution by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the market price of the Common Stock (determined as provided in subsection (d) of this Section) on the record date mentioned below less the then fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be conclusive evidence of such fair market value) of the portion of the assets so distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants applicable to one share of Common Stock, and of which the denominator shall be such market price of the Common Stock. Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Company shall distribute rights or warrants other than those referred to in subsection (b) above ("Rights") pro rata to holders of Common Stock, the Company may, in lieu of making any adjustment pursuant to this Section 4.06, make proper provision so that each Holder of a Security who converts such Security (or any portion thereof) after the record date for such distribution and prior to the expiration or redemption of the Rights shall be entitled to receive upon such conversion, in addition to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion (the "Conversion Shares"), a number of Rights to be determined as follows: (i) if such conversion occurs on or prior to the date for the distribution to the holders of Rights of separate certificates evidencing such Rights (the "Distribution Date"), the same number of Rights to which a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Conversion Shares is entitled at the time of such conversion in accordance with the terms and provisions of and applicable to the Rights; and (ii) if such conversion occurs after the Distribution Date, the same number of Rights to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which the principal amount of the Security so converted was convertible immediately prior to the Distribution Date would have been entitled on the Distribution Date in accordance with the terms and provisions of and applicable to the Rights. 
   
(d)     The "market price" per share of Common Stock on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing prices for the first 20 consecutive trading days commencing 30 trading days before the day in question. The closing price for each day shall be the last reported sales price on the New York Stock Exchange. 
   
(e)     In any case in which this Section 4.06 shall require that an adjustment be made immediately following a record date, the Company may elect to defer (but only until five Business Days following the tiling by the Company with the Trustee of the certificate described in Section 4. l0) issuing to the holder of any Security converted after such record date the shares of Common Stock and other capital stock of the Company issuable upon such conversion over and above the shares of Common Stock and other capital stock of the Company issuable upon such conversion only on the basis of the Conversion Price prior to adjustment; and, in lieu of the shares the issuance of which is so deferred, the Company shall issue or cause its transfer agents to issue due bills or other appropriate evidence of the right to receive such shares. 
   
 
 SECTION 4.07 
 
 No Adjustment. 
 
   
No adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be required until cumulative adjustments amount to 1% or more of the Conversion Price as last adjusted; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this Section 4.07 are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Article 4 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. 
   
No adjustment need be made for a transaction referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of Section 4.06 if all Holders are entitled to participate in the transaction on a basis and with notice that the Board of Directors determines to be fair and appropriate in light of the basis and notice on which holders of Common Stock participate in the transaction. 
   
No adjustments need be made for rights to purchase Common Stock pursuant to a Company plan for reinvestment of dividends or interest. 
   
 No adjustment need be made for a change in the par value of the Common Stock. 
   
To the extent the Securities become convertible into cash, no adjustment need be made thereafter as to the cash. Interest will not accrue on the cash. 
   
 
   
 17 
 
   
 
   
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Conversion Price shall not be less than the par value per share of the Common Stock. In the event an adjustment provided for herein would result in a Conversion Price of less than such par value per share, such adjusted Conversion Price shall be such par value per share. 
   
 
 SECTION 4.08 
 
 Equivalent Adjustments. 
 
   
In the event that, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to Section 4.06 above, the holder of any Security thereafter surrendered for conversion shall become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock of the Company other than shares of its Common Stock, thereafter the Conversion Price of such other shares so receivable upon conversion of any Securities shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to Common Stock contained in this  Article 4. 
   
 
 SECTION 4.09 
 
 Adjustments for Tax Purposes. 
 
   
The Company may make such reductions in the Conversion Price, in addition to those required by paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of Section 4.06, as it considers to be advisable in order that any event treated for federal income tax purposes as a dividend of stock or stock rights shall not be taxable to the recipients thereof. 
   
 
 SECTION 4.10 
 
 Notice of Adjustments. 
 
   
Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted, the Company shall promptly mail to Securityholders a notice of the adjustment and file with the Trustee an Officers' Certificate briefly stating the facts requiring the adjustment and the manner of computing it. The certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of such adjustment, absent manifest error . 
   
 
 SECTION 4.11 
 
 Notice of Certain Transactions. 
 
   
 If: 
   
(1)     the Company takes any action that would require an adjustment in the Conversion Price and if the Company does not let Holders participate pursuant to Section 4.07; 
   
(2)     the Company takes any action that would require a supplemental indenture pursuant to Section 4.12: or 
   
 (3)     there is a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, 
   
then a Holder of a Security may wish to convert such Security into shares of Common Stock prior to the record date for or the effective date of the transaction so that he may receive the rights, warrants, securities or assets that a holder of shares of Common Stock on that date may receive. Therefore, the Company shall mail to Securityholders and the Trustee a notice stating the proposed record or effective date, as the case may be. The Company shall mail the notice at least 10 days before such date; provided, however, that failure to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the validity of any transaction referred to in clause (1), (2) or (3) of this Section 4.11. 
   
 
   
 18 
 
   
 
   
 
 SECTION 4.12 
 
 Effect of Reclassifications, Consolidations, Mergers or Sales on Conversion Privilege. 
 
   
If any of the following shall occur, namely: (i) any reclassification or change of outstanding shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Securities (other than a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination), (ii) any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a party other than a merger in which the Company is the successor corporation and which does not result in any reclassification of, or change (other than a change in name, or par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination) in, outstanding shares of Common Stock or (iii) any transfer (other than a pledge) or lease of all or substantially all of the property or business of the Company as an entirety, then the Company, or such successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, shall, as a condition precedent to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, transfer or lease, execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture providing that the Holder of each Security then outstanding shall have the right to convert such Security into the kind and amount of shares of capital stock and other securities and assets (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, transfer or lease by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such Security immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, transfer or lease. Such supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments of the Conversion Price which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments of the Conversion Price provided for in this Article 4. If this Section 4.12 applies, then Section 4.06(a) does not apply. This Section 4.12, however, shall in no way affect the right a holder of a Security may otherwise have, pursuant to clause (ii) of the last sentence of Section 4.06(c), to receive Rights upon conversion of a Security. If, in the case of any such consolidation, merger, transfer or lease, the capital stock and other securities and assets (including cash) receivable thereupon by a holder of Common Stock includes shares of capital stock or other securities or assets of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be, in such consolidation, merger, transfer or lease, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the interests of the Holders as the Board of Directors shall reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing. The provisions of this Section 4.12 shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, transfers or leases. 
   
In the event the Company shall execute a supplemental indenture pursuant to this Section 4.12, the Company shall promptly file with the Trustee an Officers' Certificate briefly stating the reasons therefor. the kind or amount of shares of capital stock or securities or assets (including cash) receivable by Holders upon the conversion of their Securities after any such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, transfer or lease and any adjustment to be made with respect thereto.

 SECTION 4.13 
 
 Trustee's Disclaimer. 
 
   
The Trustee has no duty to determine when an adjustment under this Article 4 should be made, how it should be made or what such adjustment should be, but may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such adjustment, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate with respect thereto which the Company is obligated to file with the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.10. The Trustee makes no representation as to the validity or value of any securities or assets issued upon conversion of Securities, and the Trustee shall not be responsible for the Company's failure to comply with any provisions of this Article 4. 
   
The Trustee shall not be under any responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental indenture executed pursuant to Section 4.12, but may accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness thereof, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate with respect thereto which the Company is obligated to f ile with the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.12.

 SECTION 8.02 
 
 Acceleration. 
 
   
If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Section 8.01(5) or (6) with respect to the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may, by written notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 30% (or 25% in the case of an Event of Default specified in Section 8.01(1) or (2)) in principal amount of the Securities then outstanding may, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, and the Trustee shall, upon the request of such Holders, declare the unpaid principal of and any accrued but unpaid interest on all the Securities to be due and payable. Upon such declaration the principal and interest shall be due and payable immediately; provided, however, that if any Indebtedness is outstanding under the Credit Agreement at the time of such declaration, then such amount shall not become due and payable until the earlier of (x) the date in which the Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement is accelerated, or (y) the fifth day following the date of such declaration. In the event of a declaration of acceleration because an Event of Default specified in Section 8.01(4) has occurred and is continuing, such declaration of acceleration shall be automatically annulled if such payment default is cured or waived or the holders of the indebtedness that is the subject of such Event of Default have rescinded their declaration of acceleration in respect of such indebtedness within 60 days thereof and the Trustee has received written notice of such cure, waiver or rescission and no other Event of Default under Section 8.01(4) has occurred that has not been cured or waived within 60 days of the declaration of acceleration of such indebtedness in respect thereof. If an Event of Default specified in Section 8.01(5) or (6) occurs with respect to the Company, the unpaid principal of and any accrued but unpaid interest on all the Securities shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Securityholder. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities then outstanding by written notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration and its consequences if (i) all existing Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of the principal of the Securities that has become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived; (ii) to the extent the payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue installments of interest, and overdue principal that has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration, has been paid: (iii) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction; and (iv) all payments due the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee under Section 9.07 have been made. Anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event of any acceleration pursuant to this Section 8.02 the Company shall not be obligated to pay any premium that it would have had to pay if it had then elected to redeem the Securities pursuant to paragraph 5 of the Securities, except in the case of any Event of Default reason of any willful action (or inaction) taken (or not taken) by or on behalf of the Company with the intention of avoiding payment of the premium that it would have had to pay if it had then elected to redeem the Securities pursuant to paragraph 5 of the Securities, in which case an equivalent premium shall also become and be immediately due and payable to the extent permitted by law. 
   
 
   
 38 
 
   
 
   
 
 SECTION 8.03 
 
 Other Remedies.

The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Securityholder in exercising any right or remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of D efault.

The Company will redeem the aggregate principal amount of Securities outstanding on March 15, 2003 at a redemption price of 100% of principal amount, plus accrued interest to the redemption date. The Company may reduce the principal amount of Securities to be redeemed pursuant to this paragraph 6 by subtracting 100% of the principal amount (excluding premium) that the Company has delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or that the Company has redeemed other than pursuant to this paragraph 6. The Company may so subtract the same Secu rity only once. 
   
 7.     Discharge Prior to Maturity. 
   
If the Company deposits with the Trustee or Paying Agent money or U.S. Government Obligations sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the Debentures to maturity or redem ption, the Company will be discharged from the Indenture except for certain provisions thereof. 
   
 8.     Notice of Redemption. 
   
Notice of redemption will be mailed by first class mail at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Debentures to be redeemed at such holder's registered address. Debentures in denominations larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part, but only in whole multiples of $ 1,000. On and after the redemption date interest  ceases to accrue on Debentures or portions of them called for redemption. 
   
 9.     Conversion and Conversion Option upon a Change of Control. 
   
(a)     A holder of a Debenture may convert it into shares of Common Stock of the Company at any time prior to maturity, except that, if the Debenture is called for redemption, the conversion right will terminate at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the redemption date. The initial conversion price is $23.40 per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The number of shares issuable upon conversion of a Debenture is determined by dividing the principal amount converted by the conversion price in effect on the conversion date. Upon conversion, no adjustment for interest or dividends will be made. No fractional shares will be issued upon conversion; in lieu thereof, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable by the Company upon such conversion shall be rounded up to the nearest full share. 
   
(b)     To convert a Debenture, a holder must (1) complete and sign the conversion notice set forth below; (2) surrender the Debenture to a Conversion Agent; (3) furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents if required by the Registrar or Conversion Agent; and (4) pay any transfer or similar tax, if required. If a holder surrenders a Debenture for conversion after the close of business on the record date for the payment of an installment of interest and prior to the opening of business on the next interest payment date, then, notwithstanding such conversion, the interest payable on such interest payment date will be paid to the registered holder on such record date. In such event, the Debenture, when surrendered for conversion, must be accompanied by payment of an amount equal to the interest payable on such interest payment date on the principal amount of the Debenture or portion thereof then converted. A holder may convert a portion of a Debenture equal to $1,000 or any integral multiple thereof. 
   
 
   
 4 
 
   
 
   
(c)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time there occurs a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture), the Debentures may be converted, at the option of the holder thereof at any time from the date of such Change of Control until the expiration of 45 days after the date of a notice by the Company to all holders of the Debentures of the occurrence of the Change of Control, into the number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing (I) the principal amount of the Debentures to be converted by (2) the average daily closing prices (calculated in accordance with Section 4.06(d) of the Indenture) of the Common Stock for the five trading days immediately prior to the Change of Control Date (as defined in the Indenture). The Company may, at its option, elect to pay holders of the Debentures exercising their conversion rights as set forth in this paragraph 7(c) an amount of cash equal to the principal amount thereof plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of such payment. 
   
(d)     Prior to complying with the foregoing provisions, but in any event within 90 days of a Change in Control, the Company will either repay all indebtedness and terminate all commitments outstanding under the Credit Agreement or obtain the requisite consents, if any, under the Credit Agreement required to permit the repurchase of Securities required by t his covenant. 
   
 10.     Subordination. 
   
The indebtedness evidenced by the Debentures is, to the extent and in the manner provided in the Indenture, subordinate and junior in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company, as defined in the Indenture. The Debentureholder by accepting this Debenture agrees to and shall be bound by such subordination provision s and authorizes the Trustee to give them effect. 
   
In addition to all other rights of Senior Indebtedness described in the Indenture, the Senior Indebtedness shall continue to be Senior Indebtedness and entitled to the benefits of the subordination provisions irrespective of any amendment, modification or waiver of any term of any instrument relating to the Senior Indebtedness or extension or renewal of the  Senior Indebtedness. 
   
 11.     Denominations, Transfer, Exchanged. 
   
The Debentures are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000. A holder may register the transfer of or exchange Debentures in accordance with the Indenture. The Registrar may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes or other gover nmental charges that may be imposed by law or permitted by the Indenture. 
   
 
   
 5 
 
   
 
   
 12.     Persons Deemed Owners. 
   
 The registered holder of a Debenture may be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. 
   
 13.     Unclaimed Money. 
   
If money for the payment of principal or interest remains unclaimed for two years, the Trustee or Paying Agent will pay the money back to the Company at its request. After that, ho lders entitled to money must look to the Company for payment. 
   
 14.     Amendment, Supplement, Waiver. 
   
Subject to certain exceptions that require the consent of each Debentureholder who is affected, the Indenture or the Debentures may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Debentures then outstanding and any past default or compliance with any provision may be waived in a particular instance with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Debentures then outstanding. Without the consent of or notice to any Debentureholder, the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or the Debentures to, among other things, provide for uncertificated Debentures in addition to or in place of certificated Debentures, or to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency or make any other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Debentureholder. 
   
 15.     Successor Corporation. 
   
When a successor corporation assumes all the obligations of its predecessor under the Debentures and the Indenture, the predecessor corporation will be released from those obligati ons. 
   
 16.     Defaults and Remedies. 
   
An Event of Default is: default for 30 days in payment of interest on the Debentures; default in payment of principal of them; failure by the Company for 60 days after notice to it to comply with any of the other provisions of the Indenture or the Debentures; certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries; and certain defaults under and acceleration prior to the maturity of other indebtedness. If an Event of Default (other than as a result of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% (or 25% in the case of a default with respect to payment of principal of or interest on the Securities) in principal amount of the Debentures then outstanding may declare the unpaid principal of and accrued but unpaid interest to the date of acceleration on the Debentures then outstanding to be due and payable, all as and to the extent provided in the Indenture. If an Event of Default occurs as a result of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, the unpaid principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on the Debentures then outstanding shall become due and payable immediately without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Debentureholder, all as and to the extent provided in the Indenture. Debentureholders may not enforce the Indenture or the Debentures except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee may require indemnity and security satisfactory to it before it enforces the Indenture or the Debentures.
