WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 4.03(a) and 7.03(c) of the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner has the power, without the consent of the Limited Partners, to cause the Partnership to issue such OP Units to Owner and to amend the Partnership Agreement to reflect such issuance. 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 
NOW, THEREFORE, the General Partner desires to effect this Amendment to the Partnership Agreement as provided herein: 
 1.            
On the date of this Amendment, an aggregate of 2,823,790 additional OP Units are hereby issued to Owner and Exhibit A to the Partnership Agreement is hereby amended and restated as  set forth on  Schedule A hereto to reflect such issuance. The OP Units being issued to Owner shall carry with them the rights, preferences, and obligations of other OP Units, except that (i) the redemption rights under Section 8.06 of the Partnership Agreement applicable to the 1,946,483 OP Units designated on  Schedule A  as " SC Redeemable OP Units" shall be modified as specified in paragraph 2 below, and (ii) the redemption rights under Section 8.06 of the Partnership Agreement and the amounts payable upon liquidation of the Partnership as provided in Article XIII of the Partnership Agreement with respect to the 282,379 OP Units designated on  Schedule A  as " SC Limited Participation OP Units " shall be modified as provided in paragraph 3 below. 
In exchange for the Contribution, the Owner shall be deemed to have contributed to the Partnership Property having an aggregate value of $48,851,565.54, or a per OP Unit value of $ 17.30 (the " Unit Valuation "). 
 2.           If on or before January 31, 2016, the General Partner receives one or more Notices of Redemption, in the form attached as Exhibit A to this Amendment, pursuant to Section 8.06(a) o f the Partnership Agreement relating to OP Units designated on  Schedule A as SC Redeemable OP Units (which notice may be delivered prior to January 1, 2016), the General Partner shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 8.06 of the Partnership Agreement, cause the Partnership to pay cash for such OP Units at a price per redeemed SC Redeemable OP Unit equal to the Unit Valuation no later than five busine ss days from receipt of such notice, but in no event prior to January 4, 2016. 3.            
 If the General Partner receives one or more Notices of Redemption, in the form attached as  Exhibit A to this Amendment, pursuant to Section 8.06(a) of the Partnership Agreement relating to OP Units designated on  Schedule A as SC Limited Participation OP Units, the Value of a REIT Share for purposes of determining the Cash Amount payable upon such redemption shall equal the Value as specified in the  Partnership Agreement, except that: 
(i)	if such Value as so calculated is less than 90% of the Unit Valuation, then the Value of a REIT Share for purposes of determining the Cash Amount payable upon such redemption s hall be adjusted to equal to 90% of such Unit Valuation; or 
(ii)	if such Value as so calculated is greater than 115% of the Unit Valuation, then the Value of a REIT Share for purposes of determining the Cash Amount payable upon such redempt ion shall be adjusted to equal 115% of such Unit Valuation. 
Should the Corporation make an election pursuant to Section 8.06(b) of the Partnership Agreement to redeem any OP Units designated on  Schedule A as SC Limited Participation OP Units for REIT Shares, the REIT Shares Amount for purposes of such redemption shall equal the REIT Shares Amount as specified in the Partnership Agr eement, except that 
(i)	if the Value of a REIT Share used for purposes of such redemption is less than 90% of the Unit Valuation, then the number of REIT Shares to be issued upon redemption of each such SC Limited Participation OP Unit the Corporation has elected to redeem for REIT Shares shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing (x) 90% of the Unit Valuation by (y)  the Value of a REIT Share; or 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
                   
 
(ii)	if the Value of a REIT Share used for purposes of such redemption is greater than 115% of the Unit Valuation, then the number of REIT Shares to be issued upon redemption of each such SC Limited Participation OP Unit the Corporation has elected to redeem for REIT Shares shall equal the quotient determined by dividing (x) 115% of the Unit Valuation by (y)  the Value of a REIT Share. 
 In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Partnership Agreement: 
(i)	if the amount to be distributed under Article XIII of the Partnership Agreement in respect of each OP Unit designated on  Schedule A as an SC Limited Participation OP Unit is less than 90% of the Unit Valuation, then the value of the amount that will be distributed pursuant to Article XIII in respect of each su ch SC Limited Participation OP Unit shall be adjusted to equal to 90% of the Unit Valuation; or 
(ii)	if the amount to be distributed under Article XIII of the Partnership Agreement in respect of each OP Unit designated on  Schedule A as an SC Limited Participation OP Unit is greater than 115% of the Unit Valuation, then the value of amount that will be distributed pursuant to Article XIII in respect of each su ch SC Limited Participation OP Unit shall be adjusted to equal to 115% of the Unit Valuation. 
The foregoing calculations shall be adjusted in the reasonable discretion of the General Partner to take into account events including but not limited to distributions, splits, subdivisions or other combinations of REIT Shares, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of a holder of OP Units issued in connection with the Contribution Agreeme nt. 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 4.           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Partnership Agreement or this Amendment, in no event may OP Units issued pursuant to the Contribution Agreement be redeemed for REIT Shares if the issuance of such REIT Shares would require the prior approval of shareholders of the REIT under the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Stock Market or otherwise, and provided that in such event such OP Units shall be redeemed for cash in accordance with Section 3 of this Amendment for SC Limited Participation OP Units and in accorda nce with the Partnership Agreement for all other OP Units. 5.           The General Partner agrees not to unreasonably withhold its consent to, and will not require a legal opinion to be delivered in connection with, a Transfer by a constituent member  of Owner identified on Exhibit D to the Contribution Agreement (each a " Sternco Holder " and collectively, the " Sternco Holders") if such Transfer is made to the immediate family members, the estate or to the legal representatives of such Sternco Holder or to trusts formed for such Sternco Holder's benefit, provided that such transferee is an "accredited investor" as such term is defined in Rule 501 under Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and certifies as to such status by executing and timely delivering to the Partnership an Accredited Investor Questionnaire in the form attached as Exhibit M to the Contribution Agreement, and provided further that such Transfer is made in connection with bona fide estate planning purposes, or in connection with a Transfer by such Sternco Holder to its estate. 6.            No Amendment.  The provisions Sections 1 through 7 of this Amendment may not be amended without the consent of a majority of the Notice Partners ( as such term is defined in the Tax Protection Agreement ). 
   
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 7.            Effective Date of Transfer.  The Transfer of the OP Units set forth on Schedule A hereto from Owner to Sternco Holders, and any Transfer by a Sternco Holder of such OP Units in compliance with Section 5 hereof and the Partnership Agreement, as amended, shall be effective as of the effective date of such Transfer. 8.            Partnership Agreement .  Except as set forth herein, the Partnership Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 9.            Governing Law.  This Amendment shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware.
