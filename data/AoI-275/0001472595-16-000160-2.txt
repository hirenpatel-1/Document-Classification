In addition to participation in cash dividends on Common Stock as set forth in Section 4(a), holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, on each share o f Series A Preferred Stock and with respect to each Dividend Period, an amount (such amount, the " Net Preferred Dividend ") equal to the Dividend Rate   multiplied   by the Liquidation Preference per share of Series A Preferred Stock (the " Preferred Dividend").

 (c) Payment of Dividends. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Certificate of Designations, cash dividends shall be paid only to the extent (i) the Company has funds legally available for such payment, (ii) there are no provisions in any of the Debt Documents prohibiting the payment of cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock in such amount on the applicable Dividend Payment Date and (iii) the Board of Directors, or an authorized committee thereof, declares such dividend payable. To the extent the Board of Directors desires to declare any cash dividend or other distribution in cash on the Common Stock during any Dividend Period that requires a corresponding cash dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 4(a), it may do so only to the extent that (i) the Company has funds legally available for the payment of such dividend or distribution in cash on all of the shares of Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding and (ii) such cash dividend or distribution on the Common Stock and the Series A Preferred Stock shall be payable only on the applicable Dividend Payment Date for such Dividend Period.

With respect to the PIK Dividend, the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be issued in payment of such PIK Dividend with respect to each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be determined by dividing (A) the amount of the Preferred Dividend by (B) the Liquidation Preference (excluding any amounts added to the initial Liquidation Preference pursuant to the proviso in the definition of Liquidation Preference and Section 4(b)) per share of Series A Preferred Stock. To the extent that any Preferred Dividend would result in the issuance of a fractional share of Series A Preferred Stock to any holder, then the amount of such fraction multiplied by the Liquidation Preference shall be paid in cash (unless there are no legally available funds with which to make such cash payment, in which event such cash amount shall be added to the Liquidation Preference in accordance with Section 4(a)). 
 (d) Priority of Dividends. Subject to Sections 4(a), (b) and (c), Section 8 and Section 9, such dividends (payable in cash, securities or other property) as may be determined by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof may be declared and paid on any Capital Stock, including Common Stock and other Junior Stock, from time to time out of any funds legally available fo r such payment.

To the extent such amount is paid in full to all holders of Series A Preferred Stock and all the holders of Parity Stock, the holders of Junior Stock of the Company shall be entitled to receive all remaining assets of the Company (or proceeds thereof) according to their respective rights and preferences. 
 (b) Partial Payment. If in connection with any distribution described in Section 5(a) above the assets of the Company or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay the liquidation preferences in full to all holders of Series A Preferred Stock and all holders of Parity Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and to the holders of all such other Parity  Stock shall be paid   pro rata  in accordance with the respective aggregate liquidation preferences of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of all such other Parity Stock.

 (a)If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, issue shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on shares of Common Stock, or if the Company effects a share split or share combination in respect of the Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following fo rmula: 
 
 where 
 
 
 
 CR 0 
 
 = 
 
the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or the Close of Business on the effective date of suc h share split or combination, as applicable; 
 
 CR ' 
 
 = 
 
the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or the Close of Business on the effective date of su ch share split or share combination, as applicable; 
 
 OS 0 
 
 = 
 
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or the Close of Business on the ef fective date of such share split or share combination, as applicable; and 
 
 OS ' 
 
 = 
 
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such dividend or distribution, or the Close of Business on the effective date of such share split or share combin ation, as applicable. 
 
 
 
The Company shall not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in treasury by the Company. 
 (b)Except as otherwise provided for by Section 8(c), if the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, distribute to all  or substantially all holders of its outstanding shares 
 
 
 9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of Common Stock any options, rights or warrants entitling them for a period of not more than 45 days from the Record Date of such distribution to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the Record Date of such distribution, the Conversion Ra te shall be adjusted based on the following formula: 
 
 
 where 
 
 
 
 CR 0 
 
 = 
 
the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution; 
 
 CR ' 
 
 = 
 
the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution; 
 
 OS 0 
 
 = 
 
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution; 
 
 X 
 
 = 
 
the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such options, rights or warrants; and 
 
 Y 
 
 = 
 
the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate price payable to exercise such options, rights or warrants divided by the average Closing Price of the Common Stock over  the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Record Date. 
 
 
 
To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered pursuant to any such options, rights or warrants that are non-transferable upon the expiration or termination of such options, rights or warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate which would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the distribution of such options, rights or warrants been made on the basis of the delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. 
In determining the aggregate price payable to exercise such options, rights or warrants, there shall be taken into account any amount payable on exercise thereof, with the value of  such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. 
 
 
 10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c)    If the Company, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all or substantially all holders of its Common Stock shares of any class of Capital Stock of the Company, cash, evidences of its indebtedness, assets, property or rights or warrants to acquire Capital Stock or other securities, but excluding (i) dividends or distributions as to which an adjustment under Section 8(a) or Section 8(b) shall apply, (ii) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash to the extent that the Series A Preferred Stock participates on an as-converted basis with the Common Stock in a cash dividend or distribution in accordance with Section 4(a), and (iii) SpinOffs to which the provision set forth below in this Section 8(c) shall apply (any of such shares of Capital Stock, cash, indebtedness, assets, property or rights or warrants to acquire Common Stock or other securities, hereinafter in this Section 8(c) called the " Distributed Property "), then, in each such case the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula: 
 
 
 where 
 
 
 
 CR 0 
 
 = 
 
the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution; 
 
 CR ' 
 
 = 
 
the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution; 
 
 SP 0 
 
 = 
 
the average Closing Price of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Record Date for such distribution; and 
 
 FMV 
 
 = 
 
(i) for cash dividends or distributions, the amount of cash distributed and (ii) for other Distributed Property, the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) of the portion of Distributed Property, in each case, with respect to each outstanding share of Common Stock on the Record Date for such distribution. 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the then fair market value (as so determined) of the portion of the Distributed Property so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is  equal to or greater than SP 0   as set forth above (a " Liquidating Distribution"), then in lieu of the foregoing adjustment, the Company shall distribute to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock on the date such Distributed Property is distributed to holders of Common Stock, but without requiring such holder to convert its shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the amount of Distributed Property such holder would have received had such holder owned a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Per Share Amount on the Record Date fixed for determination for shareholders entitled to receive such Liquidating Distr ibution;   provided ,   however, that the Company shall not distribute Distributed Property to either the holders of the Common Stock or the Preferred Stock to the extent such distribution would be prohibited by any provision of any Debt Document. If the Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any distribution for purposes of this Section 8(c) by reference to the actual or when issued trading market for any securities, it shall in doing so consider the prices in such market over the same period used in computing the Current Market Price of the Common  Stock for purposes of calculating SP 0   in the formula in this Section 8(c). 
 
 
 11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this Section 8(c) where there has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock consisting of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company (a " Spin-Off "), the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the Close of Business on the 10 th  Trading Day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off shall be increased based on the following formula: 
 
 where 
 
 
 
 CR 0 
 
 = 
 
 the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Close of Business on the 10 th   Trading Day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off; 
 
 CR ' 
 
 = 
 
 the new Conversion Rate in effect from and after the Close of Business on the 10 th   Trading Day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off; 
 
 FMV 
 
 = 
 
the average of the Closing Prices of the Capital Stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of Common Stock applicable to one share of Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off; and 
 
 MP 0 
 
 = 
 
the average Closing Price of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period calculated immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off. 
 
 
 
 Such adjustment shall occur on the 10 th   Trading Day immediately following, and including, the effective date of the Spin-Off. 
For purposes of this Section 8(c), Section 8(a) and Section 8(b) hereof, any dividend or distribution to which this Section 8(c) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock, or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock to which Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof applies (or both), shall be deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness, assets or shares of Capital Stock other than such shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants to which Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof applies (and any Conversion Rate adjustment required by this Section 8(c) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or such options, rights or warrants to which Section 8(a) or 8(b) hereof applies (and any further Conversion Rate adjustment required by Section 8(a) and 8(b) hereof with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except (A) the Close of Business on the Record Date of such dividend or distribution shall be substituted for "the Close of Business on the Record Date," "the Close of Business on the Record Date or the Close of Business on the effective date," "after the Close of Business on the Record Date for such dividend or distribution or the Close of Business on the effective date of such share split or share combination" and "the Close of Business on the Record Date for such distribution" within the meaning of Section 8(a) and 8(b) hereof and (B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding immediately prior to the Close of Business on the Record Date or the Close of Business on the effective date" within the meaning of Section 8(a) hereof. 
If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time while any of the Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, distribute options, rights or warrants to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for, purchase or convert into shares of Capital Stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which op tions, rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events (" Trigger Event"): (x) are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (y) are not exercisable; and (z) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock, shall be dee med not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section 8(c), (and no adjustment to 
 
 
 12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the Conversion Rate under this Section 8(c) shall be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event and a distribution or deemed distribution under the terms of such options, rights or warrants at which time an appropriate adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Rate shall be made in the same manner as provided for under this Section 8(c). If any such options, rights or warrants are subject to events, upon the occurrence of which such options, rights or warrants become exercisable to purchase different securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall be deemed to be the date of distribution and Record Date with respect to new options, rights or warrants for purposes of this Section 8(c) (and a termination or expiration of the existing rights or warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof). In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed distribution) of options, rights or warrants (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 8(c) was made, (1) in the case of any such options, rights or warrants that shall all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case may be, as though it were a distribution under this Section 8(c), equal to the per share redemption or repurchase price received by a holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such options, rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such options, rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the case of such options, rights or warrants that shall have expired or been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted as if such options, rights or warrants had not been issued. 
 (d)    If the Company, during the eighteen month period following the Original Issue Date, shall issue shares of Common Stock or any other security convertible into, exercisable or ex changeable for Common Stock (such Common Stock or other security, " Equity-Linked Securities"), for a consideration per share of Common Stock (or conversion price per share of Common Stock) less than the Current Market Price of Common Stock on the date the Company fixes the offering price (or conversion price) of Equity-Linked Securities, the Conversion Rate shall be increased based on the following formula: 
 
 
 where: 
 
 
 
 CR 0 
 
 = 
 
 the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the issuance of such Equity-Linked Securities; 
 
 CR ' 
 
 = 
 
 the new Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the issuance of such Equity-Linked Securities; 
 
 AC 
 
 = 
 
 the aggregate consideration paid or payable for such Equity Linked Securities; 
 
 OS 0 
 
 = 
 
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of such Equity-Linked Securities; 
 
 OS ' 
 
 = 
 
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of such Equity-Linked Securities or issuable pursuant to such Equity-Linked Securities; and 
 
 SP ' 
 
 = 
 
 the Closing Price of the Common Stock on the date of issuance of such Equity-Linked Securities. 
 
 
 
 The adjustment shall become effective immediately after such issuance. 
 This Section 8(d) shall not apply to Excluded Issuances. 
 (e)    The Company may make increases in the Conversion Rate, in addition to any other increases required by this Section 8, if the Board of Directors (by action of a majority of the directors that are neither "Investor Designees" (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) nor Preferred Directors (" Independent Majority ")) deems it advisable and 
 
 
 13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
necessary to avoid or diminish any income tax to holders of the Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of shares of Common Stock (or issuance of options, rights or warrants for Common Stock) or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes or for any other reason provided, however, that if there are any Investor Designees or Preferred Directors on the Board of Directors at such time, the Company may not take such action without the approval of the Investor Designees and Preferred Directors, which approval may only be withheld if the Investor Designees and Preferred Directors reasonably determine that such action is likely to result in a material increase in U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax to holders of Series A Preferred Stock. If the Company takes any action affecting the Common Stock, other than an action described in Sections 8(a) though 8(d), which upon a determination by the Board of Directors by action of an Independent Majority, such determination intended to be a "fact" for purposes of Section 151(a) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, would materially adversely affect the conversion rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Conversion Rate shall be increased, to the extent permitted by law, in such manner, if any, and at such time, as the Board of Directors by action of an Independent Majority determines in good faith to be equitable  in the circumstances. 
 Section 9 Voting Rights . 
 (a) General.

 (2) Term.  Each Preferred Director shall serve until the next annual meeting of the shareholders of the Company and until his or her successor is elected and qualifies in accordance with this Section 9(b) and the Bylaws, unless such Preferred Director is earlier removed in accordance with the Bylaws or Investor Rights Agreement, resigns or is otherwise unable to serve. Subject to the Investor Rights Agreement, in the event any Preferred Director is removed, resigns or is unable to serve as a member of the Board of Directors, the Investor Majority shall have the right to fill such vacancy. Each Preferred Director may only be elected to the Board of Directors by the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with  this Section 9(b), and each such director's seat shall otherwise remain vacant. 
 (3) Non-Limitation of Voting Rights.

 (B)the purchase, redemption or other acquisition for consideration by the Company, directly or indirectly, of any Common Stock, other Junior Stock or Parity Stock (except as necessary to effect (1) a reclassification of Junior Stock for or into other Junior Stock, (2) a reclassification of Parity Stock for or into other Parity Stock with the same or lesser aggregate liquidation preference, (3) a reclassification of Parity Stock into Junior Stock, (4) the exchange or conversion of one share of Junior Stock for or into another share of Junior Stock, (5) the exchange or conversion of one share of Parity Stock for or into another share of Parity Stock with the same or lesser per share liquidation amount or (6) the exchange or conversion of one share of Parity Stock into Junior Stock), in each case if, at the time of such purchase, redemption or other acquisition, dividends on the Series A Prefe rred Stock have not been paid in full in cash;

 (3)any statutory share exchange of the Company with another Person (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition); or 
 (4)any tender offer or exchange offer which, in combination with any related transactions, would result in a Change of Control of the Company (in which case, the Reorganization Event  for such purposes shall be all such transactions taken together), 
in each case in which holders of Common Stock would be entitled to receive cash, securities or other property for their shares of Common Stock (any such event specified in this Sec tion 10(a), a " Reorganization Event"), each share of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Reorganization Event shall (subject to conversion rights pursuant to Section 7), in the event of a Change of Control, be exchanged for (or in the event that the transaction is not a Change of Control, be exchanged for the right to receive upon conversion of the Series A Preferre d Stock thereafter

at the time of the holder's election, in accordance with the terms hereof) whichever of the following has the greatest value (as determined by the Board of Directors in its reasonable discretion): (A) an amount in cash equal to the sum of (1) the Liquidation Preference per share of the Series A Preferred Stock   plus  (2) an amount per share equal to accrued but unpaid dividends not previously added to the Liquidation Preference from and including the immediately preceding Dividend Payment Date  to but excluding the date on which such Reorganization Event occurs (the " Reorganization Event Date "); (B) an amount equal to the   product   of (I) the Per Share Amount as of the Reorganization Event Date   multiplied  by (II) the amount of cash, securities or other property (such securities or other property having a value equal to its fair market value as reasonably determined by the Board of Directors) distributed or to be distributed in respect of the Common Stock in connection with such Reorganization Event to a holder of Common Stock that was not the counterparty to the Reorganization Event or an Affiliate of such counterparty (such cash, securities and other property, the " Exchange Property"); and (C) to the extent the Reorganization Event constitutes or would constitute a Fundamental Change, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) 101%   multiplied   by (y) the sum of (1) the Liquidation Preference per share of the Series A Preferred Stock   plus  (2) an amount per share equal to accrued but unpaid dividends not previously added to the Liquidation Preference from and including the immediately preceding Dividend Payment Date  to, but excluding, the Reorganization Event Date;   provided ,   however, that the Company shall not distribute cash, securities or other property as provided in this Section 10(a) to either the holders of the Common Stock or the Preferred Stock to the extent such distribution would be prohibited by any provision of any Debt Document. In case of any Reorganization Event, provision shall be made in such transaction so that the holders of any Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled, but not obligated, to participate in whole or in part in such Reorganization Event directly by surrendering such Series A Preferred Stock in exchange for the Exchange Property receivable in such Reorganization Event applicable to such Series A Preferred Stock on an as converted basis. 
 (b)In the event that (i) the Board of Directors determines pursuant to Section 10(a) that the Series A shall be exchanged for Exchange Property and (ii) the holders of the shares of the Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the form of consideration to be received in such transaction, the "Exchange Property" that holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive shall be determined by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

The Company (or any successor) shall, within 20 days of the occurrence of any Internal Reorganization Event, provide written notice to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock of the occurrence of such event.
