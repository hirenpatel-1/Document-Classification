 ARTICLE VI: SHARES AND THEIR TRANSFER 
 
 SECTION 6.1   Certificates for Stock . 
 
Every owner of stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to have a certificate or certificates, to be in such form as the Board shall prescribe, certifying the number and class or series of shares of the stock of the Corporation owned by such owner. The certificates representing shares of such stock shall be numbered in the order in which they shall be issued and shall be signed in the name of the Corporation by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or any Vice President, and by the Secretary. Any or all of the signatures on the certificates may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed, or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon, any such certificate, shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, such certificate may nevertheless be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as though the person who signed such certificate, or whose facsimile signature shall have been placed thereupon, were such an officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. A record shall be kept of the respective names of the persons, firms or corporations owning the stock represented by such certificates, the number and class or series of shares represented by such certificates, respectively, and the respective dates thereof, and in case of cancellation, the respective dates of cancellation. Every certificate surrendered to the Corporation for exchange or transfer shall be canceled, and no new certificate or certificates shall be issued in exchange for any existing certificate until such existing certificate shall have been so canceled, except in cases provided for in Section 6.4 hereof.

The person in whose name shares of stock stand on the books of the Corporation shall be deemed the owner thereof for all purposes as regards the Corporation. Whenever any transfer of shares shall be made for collateral security, and not absolutely, such fact shall be so expressed in the entry of transfer if, when the certificate or certificates shall be presented to the Corporation for transfer, both the transferor and the transferee request the Corporation to do so. 
 
 SECTION 6.3   Regulations . 
 
The Board may make such rules and regulations as it may deem expedient, not inconsistent with these Bylaws, concerning the issue, transfer and registration of certificates for shares of the stock of the Corporation.

 SECTION 6.4   Lost, Stolen, Destroyed, and Mutilated Certificates . 
 
In any case of loss, theft, destruction, or mutilation of any certificate of stock, another may be issued in its place upon proof satisfactory to the Board of such loss, theft, destruction, or mutilation and upon the giving of a bond of indemnity to the Corporation in such form and in such sum as the Board may direct; provided, however, that a new certificate may be issued with out requiring any bond when, in the judgment of the Board, it is proper so to do. 
 
 ARTICLE VII: INDEMNIFICATION 
 
 SECTION 7.1   Indemnification of Directors and Officers . 
 
To the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (provided that the effect of any such amendment shall be prospective only) (the "Delaware Law"), a director of the Corporation shall not be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of his or her fiduciary duty as a director. The Corporation shall indemnify, in the manner and to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware Law (but in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), any person (or the estate of any person) who is or was a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether or not by or in the right of the Corporation, and whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. The Corporation may, to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware Law, purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any such person against any liability which may be asserted against such person. The Corporation may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including without limitation a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such sums as may become necessary or desirable to effect the indemnification as provided herein. To the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware Law, the indemnification provided herein shall include expenses as incurred (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement and any such expenses shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the person seeking indemnification to repay such amounts if it is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Section 7.1, no advance shall be made by the Corporation if a determination is reasonably and promptly made by the Board by a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested Directors, or (if such a quorum is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs) by independent legal counsel to the Corporation, that, based upon the facts known to the Board or such counsel at the time such determination is made, (a) the party seeking an advance acted in bad faith or deliberately breached his or her duty to the Corporation or its stockholders, and (b) as a result of such actions by the party seeking an advance, it is more likely than not that it will ultimately be determined that such party is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7.1. The indemnification provided herein shall not be deemed to limit the right of the Corporation to indemnify any other person for any such expenses to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware Law, nor shall it be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any person seeking indemnification from the Corporation may be entitled under any agreement, the Corporation's Bylaws, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. The Corporation may, but only to the extent that the Board of Directors may (but shall not be obligated to) authorize from time to time, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Section 7.1 as it applies to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 SECTION 7.2   Indemnification of Employees and Agents . 
 
Subject to Section 7.1, the Corporation may, but only to the extent that the Board may (but shall not be obligated to) authorize from time to time, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article VII as they apply to the indemnification and advancement of expen ses of directors and officers of the Corporation. 
 
 SECTION 7.3   Enforcement of Indemnification . 
 
The rights to indemnification and the advancement of expenses conferred above shall be contract rights. If a claim under this Article VII is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days after written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of such claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expenses of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) any suit by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel or stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall either create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such a dvancement of expenses, under this Article VII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.
