 (A)  Procedure. Any indemnification (but not advancement of expenses) under this Article VII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, as the same exists or hereafter may be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment). Such determination shall be made with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination (a) by a majority vote of the directors who were not parties to such proceeding (the "Disinterested Directors"), even though less than a quorum, (b) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, (c) if there are no such Disinterested Directors, or if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (d) by the stockholders. 
 (B)  Advances for Expenses. Expenses (including attorneys' fees, costs and charges) incurred by a director or officer of the Corporation in defending a proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VII. The majority of the Disinterested Directors may, in the manner set forth above, and upon approval of such director or officer of the Corporation, authorize the Corporation's counsel to represent such person, in any pro ceeding, whether or not the Corporation is a party to such proceeding. 
 (C)  Procedure for Indemnification. Any indemnification or advance of expenses (including attorney's fees, costs and charges) under this Article VII shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60 days upon the written request of the director or officer (and, in the case of advance of expenses, receipt of a written undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified therefor pursuant to the terms of this Article VII). The right to indemnification or advances as granted by this Article VII shall be enforceable by the director or officer in any court of competent jurisdiction, if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no d isposition thereof is made within 60 days. Such 
 
 
person's costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his/her right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such action shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advance of expenses (including attorney's fees, costs and charges) under this Article VII where the required undertaking, if any, has been received by the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, as the same exists or hereafter may be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its independent legal counsel and its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he/she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, as the same exists or hereafter may be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), nor the fact that there has been an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its independent legal counsel and its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claima nt has not met the applicable standard of conduct. 
 (D)  Other Rights; Continuation of Right to Indemnification. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article VII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or statutory), bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his/her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office or while employed by or acting as agent for the Corporation, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administers of such person. All rights to indemnification under this Article VII shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each director or officer of the Corporation who serves or served in such capacity at any time while this Article VII is in effect. Any repeal or modification of this Article VII or any repeal or modification of relevant provisions of the DGCL or any other applicable laws shall not in any way diminish any rights to indemnification of such director or officer or the obligations of the Corporation arising hereunder with respect to any proceeding arising out of, or relating to, any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of such modification or repeal. For the purposes of this Article VII, references to "the Corporation" include all constituent corporations absorbed in a consolidation or merger as well as the resulting or surviving corporation, so that any person who, following such consolidation or merger, is a director or officer of such a constituent corporation or is serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other entity shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VII, with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation during the period following such consolidation or merger, as he would if he/she had served the resulting or surviving corporation in the same capacity. 
 (E)  Insurance. The Corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was or has agreed to become a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other entity, against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him or on his behalf in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him ag ainst such liability under the provisions of this Article VII;  provided, however, that such insurance is available on acceptable terms, which determination shall be made by a vote of a majority of the Board of Directors. 
 (F)  Savings Clause. If this Article VII or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each person entitled to indemnification under the first paragraph of this Article VII as to all costs, expenses, liabilities and losses (including attorneys' fees and related costs, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties, penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such person and for which indemnification is available to such person pursuant to this Article VII to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article VII that shall not have been invalidated an d to the full extent permitted by applicable law. 
 
 
 ARTICLE VIII 
 ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT/SPECIAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS
