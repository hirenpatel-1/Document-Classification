Special meetings of the shareholders may be called by the chairman of the board, a majority of the board of directors, or, upon written demand, by the holders of not less than  one-tenth (1/10) of all the shares entitled to vote at such meeting. The place of said meetings shall be the principal office of the Corporation, unless otherwise designated by the director s. 
 3.  Notice of Shareholder Meetings. Written or printed notice stating the place, day, and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called and the person or persons calling the meeting, shall be delivered either personally or by mail or at the direction of the president, secretary, officer, or person calling the meeting to each shareholder entitled to vote at the meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be delivered not less than ten (10) days nor more than two (2) months before the date of the meeting, and shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail addressed to the shareholder at his address as it appears on the stock transfer books of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid. The person giving such notice shall certify that the notice required by this paragraph has been given. 
 4.  Quorum Requirements. A majority of the shares entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. A meeting may be adjourned despite the absence of a quorum, and notice of an adjourned meeting need not be given if the time and place to which the meeting is adjourned are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. When a quorum is present at any meeting, a majority in interest of the stock there represented shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of the charter, these bylaws, or by the laws of Tennessee, a larger or different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern the decision of such quest ion. 
 5.  Waiver of Notice. Any shareholder may waive in writing notice of any meeting either before, at or after the meeting. Attendance by a shareholder in person or by proxy at a meeting shall constitute  a waiver of objection to lack of notice or defective notice and a waiver 
 
 
of objection to consideration of a matter that was not described in the meeting notice unless the shareholder objects in the manner required by law. 
 6.  Voting and Proxies. Every shareholder shall be entitled to one (1) vote for each share of stock standing in his name on the books of the Corporation at the time of any regular or special meeting. Every shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting may do so either in person or by written proxy, which proxy shall be filed with the secretary of the meeting before being voted. Such proxy shall entitle the holders thereof to vote at any adjournment of such meeting, but shall not be valid after the final adjournment thereof. No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of eleven (11) months from the date of its execution unless otherwise provided in the proxy. 
 7.  Procedures for Bringing Business before Shareholder Meeting. At an annual or special meeting of shareholders, only such business shall be conducted, and only such proposals shall be acted upon, as shall have been properly brought before an annual or special meeting of shareholders. To be properly brought before an annual or special meeting of shareholders, business must be (i) in the case of a special meeting called by the Chairman of the Board or at the request of the Board of Directors, specified in the notice of the special meeting (or any supplement thereto), or (ii) in the case of an annual meeting properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the annual or special meeting by a shareholder. For business to be properly brought before such a meeting of shareholders by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a shareholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the date of the meeting; provided, however, that if fewer than 100 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholders to be timely must be so delivered or received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the earlier of (i) the day on which such notice of the date of such meeting was mailed or (ii) the day on which such public disclosure was made.

Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at a meeting of shareholders except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article I, Section 7. The Chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these Bylaws, and if the Chairman should so determine, the Chairman shall so declare to the me eting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted. 
 8.  SEC Proxy Rules. In addition to complying with the provisions of Article I, Section 7, a shareholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and t he rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set 
 
 
forth in Article I, Section 7. Nothing in Article I, Section 7 shall be deemed to affect any rights of shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. For such proposals to be acted upon at a meeting, however, compliance with the notice provisions of Article I, S ection 7 is also required.
