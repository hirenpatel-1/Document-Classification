THIRD, ARTICLE VI, Section 2 of the Restated Articles is hereby amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: 
"2. By-laws. The board of directors may amend, add to or repeal the By-laws, in whole or in part, except with respect to any provision thereof which by law or the By-laws requires action by the shareholders. The By-laws may, but are not required to, provide that in a meeting of shareholders other than a Contested Election Meeting (as defined below), when a quorum is present at the meeting, a nominee for election as a director at such meeting shall be elected to the board of directors only if the votes cast "for" such nominee's election exceed the votes cast "against" such nominee's election (with "abstentions," "broker non-votes" and "withheld" votes not counted as a vote "for" or "against" such nominee's election). In a Contested Election Meeting, when a quorum is present at the meeting, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in the election at such Contested Election Meeting. A meeting of shareholders shall be a "Contested Election Meeting" if there are more persons nominated for election as directors at such meeting than there are directors to be elected at such meeting, determined as of the tenth day preceding the date of the corporation's first notice to shareholders of such meeting sent pursuant to the By-laws (the "Determination Date"); provided, however, that if in accordance with the By-laws, shareholders are entitled to make nominations during a period of time that ends after the otherwise applicable Determination Date, the Determination Date shall instead be as of the end of such period." 
FOURTH, this Amendment will become effective at the time and on the date when these Articles of Amendment were received for filing.
