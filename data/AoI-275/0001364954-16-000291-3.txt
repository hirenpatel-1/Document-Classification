 Section 1.2 :      Special Meetings .  Special meetings of stockholders for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Board acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the " Whole Board," which shall mean the total number of authorized directors, whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships.

Each person who was or is made a party to, or is threatened to be made a party to, or is involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or inve stigative (a " Proceeding"), by reason of the fact that such person (or a person of whom such person is the legal representative), is or was a member of the Board or officer of the Corporation or a Reincorporated Predecessor (as defined below) or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation or a Reincorporated Predecessor as a member of the board of directors, officer or trustee of another corporation, or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans (for purposes of this Article VI , an " Indemnitee"), shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expenses, liability and loss (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such Indemnitee in connection therewith, provided such Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner that the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful. Such indemnification shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of such Indemnitees' heirs, executors and administrators. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall indemnify any such Indemnitee seeking indemnity in connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initia ted by such Indemnitee only if such Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board 
 
 
 9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or such indemnification is authorized by an agreement approved by the Board. As used herein, the term the " Reincorporated Predecessor" means a corporation that is merged with and into the Corporation in a statutory merger where (a) the Corporation is the surviving corporation of such merger; (b) the primary purpose of such merger is to change the corporate domicile of the Reincorporated Predecessor to Delaware. 
 
 Section 6.2 :      Advance of Expenses .  Except as otherwise provided in a written indemnification agreement between the Corporation and an Indemnitee, the Corporation shall pay all expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by such an Indemnitee in defending any such Proceeding as they are incurred in advance of its final disposition;   provided ,   however, that (a) if the DGCL then so requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by such an Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it should be determined ultimately by final judicial decision from which there is no appeal that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VI or otherwise; and (b) the Corporation shall not be required to advance any expenses to a person against whom the Corporation directly brings a claim, in a Proceeding, alleging that such person has breached such person's duty of loyalty to the Corporation, committed an act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, or derived an improper personal benefit from a transaction . 
 
 Section 6.3:      Non-Exclusivity of Rights .  The rights conferred on any person in this Article VI shall not be exclusive of any other right that such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaw, agreement, vote or consent of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. Additionally, nothing in this Article VI shall limit the ability of the Corporation, in its discretion, to indemnify or advance expenses to persons whom the Corporation is not obligated to indemnify or advance expenses pursuant to this Art icle VI. 
 
 Section 6.4 :      Indemnification Contracts .  The Board is authorized to cause the Corporation to enter into indemnification contracts with any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or any person serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including employee benefit plans, providing indemnification or advancement rights to such person. Such rights may be greater than those provided in this Article VI. 
 
 Section 6.5:      Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit .  The following shall apply to the extent not in conflict with any indemnification contract provided for in Section 6.4 above. 
 
 6.5.1     Right to Bring Suit. If a claim under Section 6.1 or 6.2 of this Article VI is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be thirty (30) days, the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (a) any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (b) in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in applicable law. 
 
 6.5.2     Effect of Determination. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in applicable law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. 
 
 6.5.3     Burden of Proof. In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Artic le VI, or otherwise, shall be on the Corporation. 
 
 Section 6.6 :      Nature of Rights .  The rights conferred upon Indemnitees in this Article VI shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer or trustee and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators. Any amendment, repeal or modification of any provision of this Article VI that adversely affects any right of an Indemnitee or an Indemnitee's successors shall be prospective only, and shall not adversely 
 
 
 10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
affect any right or protection conferred on a person pursuant to this Article VI and existing at the time of such amendment, repeal or modification.
