 (i) 
 
 is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of FHLBank, or 
 
 
 
 (ii) 
 
is or was serving at the request of FHLBank as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or 
 
 
 
 (iii) 
 
rendered or attempted to render emergency aid including, without limitation, first aid, rescue breathing, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or use of an automated external defibrillator, on FHLBank premises or at any FHLBank-sponsored event, function or activity, if such person is or was a director, officer or employee of FHLBank at the time of such action or a ctions, 
 
 
against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement, actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of FHLBank; and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of FHLBank, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe  that such person's conduct was unlawful. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b) 
 
 Actions By or in the Right of FHLBank. FHLBank shall indemnify any officer or director who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, by or in the right of FHLBank to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of FHLBank, or is or was serving at the request of FHLBank as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of FHLBank and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to FHLBank unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is reasonably and fairly entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the  court shall deem proper. 
 
 
 
 (c) 
 
 Success on the Merits or Otherwise. To the extent that a current or former director or officer of FHLBank has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section 8.3(a) or (b), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such director or officer shall be indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such p erson in connection therewith, including attorney fees. 
 
 
 
 (d) 
 
 Determination to Indemnify. Any indemnification under Section 8.3(a) or (b), unless ordered by a court, shall be made by FHLBank only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that (1) indemnification of the present or former director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 8.3(a) or (b), and (2) in the case of an employee or agent, such permissible indemnification is in the best interest of FHLBank and appropriate under the circumstances. Such determination shall be made (1) by the Board by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding (hereinafter referred to as "disinterested directors"), or (2) by a committee of disinterested directors designated by majority vote of disinterested directors, even though less than a quorum; or (3) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion. 
 
 
 
 (e) 
 
 Advance Payment of Expenses. Payments of expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by a current director or officer in connection with a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by FHLBank in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, beginning thirty (30) days from the date of receipt by FHLBank of such person's written application for indemnification, including a certification and supporting statement of that person's belief that he or she ultimately will become entitled to indemnification under this Section 8.3 and an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification by FHLBank as authorized in this Section 8.3. But, such expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by former directors and officers may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board deems appropriate, including that no such advance payment shall be made, or continued to be made, if at any time a disinterested majority of a quorum of FHLBank's directors reasonably concludes that the director or officer would not likely become entitled to indemnification under this Section 8.3. In the case of such a finding, advanced payments to which the director or officer is determined not entitled under this paragraph shall be reimbursed to FHLBank. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent FHLBank from imposing contractual conditions on the advance payment of costs and expenses as FHLBank deems warranted to protect its interests. 
 
 
 
 (f) 
 
 Indemnification not Exclusive. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other sections of this Section 8.3 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in a perso n's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. 
 
 
 
 (g)
