 ARTICLE I 
 OFFICES 
 Section 1.1      Offices.  The Board of Directors may establish and change the principal office or place of business of the Company at any time and may cause the Company to establish other offices or plac es of business in various jurisdictions. 
 ARTICLE II 
 MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS 
 Section 2.1      Place.  All meetings of shareholders shall be held at the principal executive office of the Company or at such other place as shall be set by the Board of Directors as stated in the notice of the meeting.  For purposes of these Bylaws, all references to "shareholders" of the Company shall have the same meaning as the term "Shareholders" as used and defined in the Company's Limited Liability Company Agreement (as it may be amended from time to time, the "LLC Agreement"). 
 Section 2.2      Annual Meeting.  An annual meeting of the shareholders for the election of directors and the transaction of any business within the powers of the Company shall be called by the Board of Directors and shall be held on a date and at the time set by the Board of Directors.  Failure to hold an annual meeting does not invalidate the Company's existence or affect any otherwise  valid acts of the Company. 
 Section 2.3      Special Meetings.  The chairman of the board, if any, or a majority of the entire Board of Directors may call a special meeting of the shareholders.  Nothing in these Bylaws shall be construed to  permit the shareholders to cause a special meeting of the shareholders to be called. 
 Section 2.4      Notice of Regular or Special Meetings.  If and to the extent required by law, the secretary shall give to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting written notice stating the time and place of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting or as otherwise may be required by any statute, the purpose for which the meeting is called, either by mail, by recognized national courier service, by presenting it to such shareholder personally, by leaving it at the shareholder's residence or usual place of business or by any other means, including electronic delivery, permitted by the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, the Exchange Act and any applicable Exchange Rule.  If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the U.S. mail addressed to the shareholder at the shareholder's address as it appears on the records of the Company, with postage thereon prepaid.  If transmitted 
 
 
 
 
 
 
electronically, such notice shall be deemed to be given when transmitted to the shareholder by an electronic transmission to any address or number of the shareholder at which the shareholder receives electronic transmissions.  The Company may give a single notice to all shareholders who share an address, which single notice shall be effective to any shareholder at such address, unless a shareholder objects to receiving such single notice or revokes a prior consent to receiving such single notice.  Failure to give notice of any meeting to one or more shareholders, or any irregularity in such notice, shall not affect the validity of any meeting fixed in accordance with this ARTICLE II or the validity of any proce edings at any such meeting. 
 Section 2.5      Notice of Adjourned Meetings.  It shall not be necessary to give notice of the time and place of any adjourned meeting or of the business to be transacted thereat other than by announcement at the meeting at  which such adjournment is taken. 
 Section 2.6      Meeting Business.  Except as otherwise expressly set forth elsewhere in these Bylaws, no business shall be transacted at an annual or special meeting of shareholders except as specifically designated in the notice or otherwise properly brought before the shareholders by or at the direction of the Board of Directors. 
 Section 2.7      Organization of Shareholder Meetings.  Every meeting of shareholders shall be conducted by an individual appointed by the Board of Directors to be chairperson of the meeting or, in the absence of such appointment, by the chairman of the board, if there be one, or, in the case of the absence of the chairman of the board, by a Managing Director in their order of seniority, or, in the absence of all of the Managing Directors, by one of the following officers present at the meeting in the following order: the vice chairman of the board, if there be one, the president, the vice presidents in their order of seniority or, in the absence of such officers, a chairperson chosen by the shareholders by the vote of holders of common shares of the Company representing a majority of the votes cast on such appointment by shareholders present in person or represented by proxy.  The secretary, an assistant secretary or a person appointed by the Board of Directors or, in the absence of such appointment, a person appointed by the chairperson of the meeting shall act as secretary of the meeting and record the minutes of the meeting.  If the secretary presides as chairperson at a meeting of the shareholders, then the secretary shall not also act as secretary of the meeting and record the minutes of the meeting.  The order of business and all other matters of procedure at any meeting of shareholders shall be determined by the chairperson of the meeting.  The chairperson of the meeting may prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and take such action as, in the discretion of such chairperson, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation: (a) restricting admission to the time set for the commencement of the meeting; (b) limiting attendance at the meeting to shareholders of record of the Company, their duly authorized proxies or other such persons as the chairperson of the meeting may determine; (c) limiting participation at the meeting on any matter to shareholders of record of the Company entitled to vote on such matter, their duly authorized proxies or other such persons as the chairperson of the meeting may determine; (d) limiting the time allotted to questions or comments by participants; (e) determining when and for how long the polls should be opened and when the polls should be closed; (f) maintaining order and security at the meeting; (g) removing any shareholder or other person who refuses to comply with meeting procedures, rules or guidelines as set forth by the chairperson of the meeting; (h) concluding a meeting or recessing or adjourning the meeting to a later date and time and at a place announced at the meeting; and (i) complying with any state and 
 
 
 2 
 
 
 
 
local laws and regulations concerning safety and security.  Without limiting the generality of the powers of the chairperson of the meeting pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the chairperson may adjourn any meeting of shareholders for any reason deemed necessary by the chairperson, including, without limitation, if (i) no quorum is present for the transaction of the business, (ii) the Board of Directors or the chairperson of the meeting determines that adjournment is necessary or appropriate to enable the shareholders to consider fully information that the Board of Directors or the chairperson of the meeting determines has not been made sufficiently or timely available to shareholders or (iii) the Board of Directors or the chairperson of the meeting determines that adjournment is otherwise in the best interests of the Company.  Unless otherwise determined by the chairperson of the meeting, meetings of shareholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the general rules of parliamentary procedure or any otherwise established rules of order. 
 Section 2.8      Quorum.  A quorum for action at any meeting of shareholders shall be as set forth in the LLC Agreement.  If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of shareholders, the chairperson of the meeting shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time without the Company having to set a new record date or provide any additional notice of such meeting, subject to any obligation of the Company to give notice pursuant to Section 2.5.  At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified.  The shareholders present, either in person or by proxy, at a meeting of shareholders which has been duly called and convened and at which a quorum was established may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum th en being present at the meeting. 
 Section 2.9      Voting.  The vote required for any matter to be voted upon by the shareholders shall be as set forth in the LLC Agreement.  There shall not be cumulative voting of the common shares of t he Company. 
 Section 2.10      Proxies.  A shareholder may cast the votes entitled to be cast by him or her either in person or by proxy executed by the shareholder or by his or her duly authorized agent in any manner permitted by law.  Such proxy shall be filed with such officer of the Company or third party agent as the Board of Directors shall have designated for such purpose for verification prior to or at such meeting.  Any proxy relating to shares of the Company shall be valid until the expiration date therein or, if no expiration is so indicated, until the time permitted under Delaware law or as otherwise provided in the LLC Agreement.  At a meeting of shareholders, all questions concerning the qualification of voters, the validity of proxies, and the acceptance or rejection of votes, shall be decided by or on behalf of the chairperson of the meeting, subject to Section 2.13. 
 Section 2.11      Record Date.  The Board of Directors may fix the date for determination of shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of shareholders.  If no date is fixed for the determination of the shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at any meeting of shareholders, only persons in whose names shares entitled to vote are recorded on the share records of the Company at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given shall be entitled to vote at such meeting.

 Section 2.12      Voting of Shares by Certain Holders.  Shares of the Company registered in the name of a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, if entitled to be voted, may be voted by the president or a vice president, a general partner, managing member or trustee thereof, as the case may be, or a proxy appointed by any of the foregoing individuals, unless some other person who has been appointed to vote such shares pursuant to a bylaw or a resolution of the governing body of such corporation or other entity or pursuant to an agreement of the partners of the partnership presents a certified copy of such bylaw, resolution or agreement, in which case such person may vote such shares.  Any trustee or other fiduciary may vote shares of the Company registered in his or her name as such fiduciary, either in person or by proxy.  Notwithstanding the apparent authority created by the prior two sentences of this Section 2.12 and the first two sentences of Section 9.5(a) of the LLC Agreement, the Board of Directors or the chairperson of the meeting may require that such person acting for a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity provide documentary evidence of his or her authority to vote the shares and of the fact that the beneficial owner of the shares has been properly solicited and authorized such person to vote as voted, and in the absence of such satisfactory evidence, the Board of Directors or the chairperson may determine such votes have not been valid ly cast. 
 Section 2.13      Inspectors. 
 (a)     Before or at any meeting of shareholders, the chairperson of the meeting may appoint one or more persons as inspectors for such meeting.  In case any person who may be appointed as an inspector fails to appear or act, the vacancy may be filled by appointment made by the Board of Directors or at the meeting by the chairperson of the meeting.  Such inspectors, if any, shall (i) ascertain and report the number of shares of the Company represented at the meeting, in person or by proxy, and the validity and effect of proxies, (ii) receive and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, (iii) report such tabulation to the chairperson of the meeting, (iv) hear and determine all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote and (v) perform such other acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all shareholders.  In the absence of such a special appoin tment, the secretary may act as the inspector. 
 (b)     Each report of an inspector shall be in writing and signed by him or her or by a majority of them if there is more than one inspector acting at such meeting.  If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be the report of the inspectors.  The report of the inspector or inspectors on the number of shares of the Company represented at the  meeting and the results of the voting shall be   prima facie   evidence thereof. 
 Section 2.14     Nominations and Other Proposals to be Considered at Meetings of Shareholders.  Nominations of individuals for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of other business to be considered by the shareholders at meetings of shareholders may be properly brought before the meeting only as set forth in this Section 2.14.  Nothing in this Section 2.14 shall be deemed to affect any right of a shareholder to request inclusion of a proposal in, or the right of the Company to omit a non-binding, precatory proposal from, any proxy statement filed by the Company with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (or any successor provision) under the Exchange Act.  All judgments and determinations made by the Board of Directors or the chairperson  of the meeting, as applicable, under this Section 2.14 (including, without limitation, 
 
 
 4 
 
 
 
 
judgments and determinations as to the validity of a proposed nomination or a proposal of other business for consideration by shareholders) shall be final and binding unless determ ined by an arbitration panel or a court of competent jurisdiction to have been made in bad faith. 
 Section 2.14.1      Annual Meetings of Shareholders . 
 (a)     Any shareholder of the Company may recommend to the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors an individual as a nominee for election to the Board of Directors.  Such recommendation shall be made by written notice to the Chair of such committee and the secretary of the Company, which notice should contain or be accompanied by the information and documents with respect to such recommended nominee and shareholder that such shareholder believes to be relevant or helpful to the Nominating and Governance Committee's deliberations.  In considering such recommendation, the Nominating and Governance Committee may request additional information concerning the recommended nominee or the shareholder(s) making the recommendation.  The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors will consider any such recommendation in its discretion.

 Section 2.14.2      Shareholder Nominations or Other Proposals Causing Covenant Breaches or Defaults.  At the same time as the submission of any shareholder nomination or proposal of other business to be considered at a shareholders meeting that, if approved and implemented by the Company, would cause the Company or any subsidiary (as defined in Section 2.14.5(c)) of the Company to be in breach of any covenant of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or otherwise cause a default (in any case, with or without notice or lapse of time) in any existing debt instrument or agreement of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or other material contract or agreement of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, the proponent shareholder or shareholders shall submit to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company (a) evidence satisfactory to the Board of Directors of the lender's or contracting party's willingness to waive the breach of covenant or default or (b) a detailed plan for repayment of the indebtedness to the lender or curing the contractual breach or default and satisfying any resulting damage claim, specifically identifying the actions to be taken or the source of funds, which plan must be satisfactory to the Board of Directors in its discretion, and evidence of the availability to the Company of substitute credit or contractual arrangements similar to the credit or contractual arrangements which are implicated by the shareholder nomination or other proposal that are at least as favorable to the Company, as determined by the Board of Directors in its discretion.  As an example and not as a limitation, at the time these Bylaws are being adopted, the Company is party to a bank credit facility that contains covenants which prohibit certain changes in the management and policies of the Company without the approval of the lenders; accordingly, a shareholder nomination or proposal which implicates these covenants shall be accompanied by a waiver of these covenants duly executed by the banks or by evidence satisfactory to the Board of Directors of the availability of funding to the Company to repay outstanding indebtedness under this credit facility and of the availability of a new credit facility on terms as favorable to the Company as the existing credit facility.  As a further example and not as a limitation, at the time these Bylaws are being adopted, the Company is party to lease and related agreements with Hospitality Properties Trust or its subsidiaries ("Hospitality Properties Trust").  Those agreements contain covenants which prohibit certain changes in the management and policies of the Company without the approval of Hospitality Properties Trust.  Accordingly, a shareholder nomination or proposal which implicates these covenants shall be accompanied by a waiver of these covenants duly executed by the applicable Hospitality Properties Trust entity or by evidence satisfactory to the Board of Directors of the availability of alternative facilities for lease and operation by the Company on terms as favorable to the Company as the applicable arrangement and of funds for the payment by the Company of any amounts required under the applicable agreement or otherwise as a result of any breach or termination of the agreement with Hospitality Propert ies Trust.

 Section 2.14.3      Shareholder Nominations or Other Proposals Requiring Governmental Action.  If (a) submission of any shareholder nomination or proposal of other business to be considered at a shareholders meeting that could not be considered or, if approved, implemented by the Company without the Company, any subsidiary of the Company, the proponent shareholder, any Proposed Nominee of such shareholder, any Proposed Nominee Associated Person of such Proposed Nominee, any Shareholder Associated Person of such shareholder, the holder of proxies or their respective affiliates or associates filing with or otherwise notifying or obtaining the consent, approval or other action of any federal, state, municipal or other governmental or regulatory body (a "Governmental Action") or (b) such shareholder's ownership of shares of the Company or any solicitation of proxies or votes or holding or exercising proxies by such shareholder, any Proposed Nominee of such shareholder, any Proposed Nominee Associated Person of such Proposed Nominee, any Shareholder Associated Person of such shareholder, or their respective affiliates or associates would require Governmental Action, then, at the same time as the submission of any shareholder nomination or proposal of other business to be considered at a shareholders meeting, the proponent shareholder or shareholders shall submit to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company (x) evidence satisfactory to the Board of Directors that any and all Governmental Action has been given or obtained, including, without limitation, such evidence as the Board of Directors may require so that any nominee may be determined to satisfy any suitability or other requirements or (y) if such evidence was not obtainable from a governmental or regulatory body by such time despite the shareholder's diligent and best efforts, a detailed plan for making or obtaining the Governmental Action prior to the election of any such Proposed Nominee or the implementation of such proposal, which plan must be satisfactory to the Board of Directors in its discretion.  As an example and not as a limitation, at the time these Bylaws are being adopted, the Company holds a controlling ownership position in a company being formed and licensed as an insurance company in the State of Indiana.  The laws of the State of Indiana have certain regulatory requirements for any person who seeks to control (as defined under Indiana law) a company which itself controls an insurance company domiciled in the State of Indiana, including by soliciting proxies representing 10% or more of its voting securities.  Accordingly, a shareholder who seeks to exercise proxies for a nomination or a proposal affecting the governance of the Company shall obtain any applicable approvals from the Indiana insurance regulatory authorities prior to exercising such proxies.  Similarly, as a further example and not as a limitation, at the time these Bylaws are being adopted, the Company has a controlling ownership interest in gaming businesses located in Louisiana and in Nevada.  Applicable Louisiana and Nevada law requires that a director be approved by the applicable state's Gaming Control Board.  Such approval process requires that any Proposed Nominee submit a detailed personal history and financial disclosures.  Accordingly, a shareholder nomination shall be accompanied by evidence that the Proposed Nominee has been approved by the applicable Gaming Control Board to be a director, or if the applicable Gaming Control Board has not approved such an application, then the shareholder nomination shall be accompanied by a copy of completed personal history and financial disclosure forms of the Proposed Nominee as submitted or to be submitted to the applicable Gaming Control Board so that the Board of Directors may determine the like lihood that the Proposed Nominee will receive such approval.

 Section 2.14.5     General . 
 (a)     If information submitted pursuant to this Section 2.14 by any shareholder proposing a nominee for election as a director or any proposal for other business at a meeting of shareholders shall be deemed by the Board of Directors incomplete or inaccurate, any authorized officer or the Board of Directors or any committee thereof may treat such information as not having been provided in accordance with this Section 2.14.  Any notice submitted by a shareholder pursuant to this Section 2.14 that is deemed by the Board of Directors inaccurate, incomplete or otherwise fails to satisfy completely any provision of this Section 2.14 shall be deemed defective and shall thereby render all proposals and nominations set forth in such notice defective.  Upon written request by the secretary of the Company or the Board of Directors or 
 
 
 13 
 
 
 
 
any committee thereof (which may be made from time to time), any shareholder proposing a nominee for election as a director or any proposal for other business at a meeting of shareholders shall provide, within three Business Days after such request (or such other period as may be specified in such request), (i) written verification, satisfactory to the secretary or any other authorized officer or the Board of Directors or any committee thereof, in his, her or its discretion, to demonstrate the accuracy of any information submitted by the shareholder pursuant to this Section 2.14, (ii) written responses to information reasonably requested by the secretary, the Board of Directors or any committee thereof and (iii) a written update, to a current date, of any information submitted by the shareholder pursuant to this Section 2.14 as of an earlier date.

It is the responsibility of a shareholder who wishes to make a nomination or other proposal to comply with the requirements of Section 2.14; nothing in this Section 2.14.5(a) or otherwise shall create any duty of the Company, the Board of Directors or any committee thereof nor any officer of the Company to inform a shareholder that the information submitted pursuant to this Section 2.14 by or on behalf of such shareholder is incomplete or inaccurate or not otherwise in accordance with this Section 2.14 nor require the Company, the Board of Directors, any committee of the Board of Directors or any officer of the Company to request clarification or updating of information provided by any shareholder but the Board of Directors, a committee thereof or the secretary acting on behalf of the Board of Directors or a committee, may do so in its, his or her discretion.

 Section 3.2      Independent Directors and Managing Directors .

An "Independent Director" is one who is not an employee of the Company or The RMR Group LLC (or its permitted successors and assigns under the Amended and Restated Business Management and Shared Services Agreement entered into between the Company and The RMR Group LLC, as the same may be in effect from time to time, "RMR LLC"), who is not involved in the Company's day to day activities, who meets the qualifications of an independent director (not including the specific independence requirements applicable only to members of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors) under Exchange Rules and the applicable rules of the SEC, as those requirements may be amended from time to time.

If at any time the Board of Directors shall not be comprised of a number of Managing Directors as is required under this Section  3.2, the Board of Directors shall take such actions as will cure such condition;   provided  that the fact that the Board of Directors does not have the requisite number of Managing Directors or has not taken such action at any time or from time to time shall not affect th e validity of any action taken by the Board of Directors.

 ARTICLE VIII 
 REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND DISCLOSURE 
 Section 8.1      Actions Requiring Regulatory Compliance Implicating the Company.  If any shareholder (whether individually or constituting a group, as determined by the Board of Directors), by virtue of such shareholder's ownership interest in the Company or actions taken by the shareholder affecting the Company, triggers the application of any requirement or regulation of any federal, state, municipal or other governmental or regulatory body on the Company or any subsidiary (for purposes of this ARTICLE VIII, as defined in Section 2.14.5(c)) of the Company or any of their respective businesses, assets or operations, including, without limitation, any obligations to make or obtain a Governmental Action (as defined in Section 2.14.3), such shareholder shall promptly take all actions necessary and fully cooperate with the Company to ensure that such requirements or regulations are satisfied without restricting, imposing additional obligations on or in any way limiting the business, assets, operations or prospects of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company.  If the shareholder fails or is otherwise unable to promptly take such actions so to cause satisfaction of such requirements or regulations, the shareholder shall promptly divest a sufficient number of shares of the Company necessary to cause the application of such requirement or regulation to not apply to the Company or any subsidiary of the Company.  If the shareholder fails to cause such satisfaction or divest itself of such sufficient number of shares of the Company by not later than the tenth (10th) day after triggering such requirement or regulation referred to in this Section 8.1, then any shares of the Company beneficially owned by such shareholder at and in excess of the level triggering the application of such requirement or regulation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be deemed to constitute shares of the Company in excess of the Ownership Limit (as defined in Section 8.1 of the LLC Agreement) and be subject to Article VIII of the LLC Agreement and any actions triggering the application of such a requirement or regulation may be deemed by the Company to be of no force or effect.  Moreover, if the shareholder who triggers the application of any regulation or requirement fails to satisfy the requirements or regulations or to take curative actions within such ten (10) day period, the Company may take all other actions which the Board of Directors deems appropriate to require compliance or to preserve the value of the Company's assets; and the Company may charge the offending shareholder for the Company's costs and expenses as well as any damages which may result to the Company. 
As  an example and not as a limitation, at the time these Bylaws are being adopted, the Company holds a controlling interest in gaming businesses in Louisiana and Nevada. Louisiana law provides that any person who owns five percent (5%) or more of gaming businesses in Louisiana shall provide detailed personal history and financial information and be found suitable by the Louisiana Gaming Control Board. Under certain circumstances, an "institutional investor," as defined under Louisiana gaming law, may be presumed suitable or qualified upon submitting documentation sufficient to establish qualifications as an institutional investor as provided under Louisiana gaming law. Nevada gaming law provides that any person who beneficially owns more than five percent (5%) of any class of voting securities of the Company must report such ownership to the Nevada Gaming Commission and any person who beneficially owns more than ten percent (10%) of any class of voting securities of the Company must apply for, be investigated by, and obtain relevant approvals and findings of suitability from the Nevada Gaming Commission. Under certain circumstances, an "institutional investor," as defined under 
 
 
 27 
 
 
 
 
Nevada gaming law, which acquires not more than twenty-five percent (25%) of any class of the Company's voting securities may apply to the Nevada Commission for a waiver of such finding of suitability if such institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only. Further, upon request of the Nevada Gaming Commission, any person holding any of the Company's securities may be required to apply to the Nevada Gaming Commission for a determination of suitability. If a person who is required or requested to file for a determination of suitability with respect to the Company and refuses to provide the Company with information required to be submitted to  applicable gaming regulatory authority, or if the Louisiana Gaming Control Board or the Nevada Gaming Commission, as applicable, declines to approve such person's holding Company securities, then, in either event, the Company  securities held by such person may be deemed to be securities in excess of the Ownership Limit and subject to the provisions of Article VIII of the LLC Agreement. Copies of the forms required to be submitted to the Louisiana Gaming Control Board and the Nevada Gaming Commission, as applicable, may be obtained by request directed to the secretary. 
As a further example and not as a limitation, at the time these Bylaws are being adopted, the Company holds a controlling ownership position in a company being formed and licensed as an insurance company in the State of Indiana.  The laws of the State of Indiana have certain regulatory requirements for any person who seeks to control (as defined under Indiana law) a company which itself controls an insurance company domiciled in the State of Indiana, including by exercising proxies representing ten percent (10%) or more of the Company's voting securities.  Accordingly, if a shareholder seeks to exercise proxies for a matter to be voted upon at a meeting of the Company's shareholders without having obtained any applicable approvals from the Indiana insurance regulatory authorities, such proxies representing ten percent (10%) or more of the Company's voting securities will, subject to Sect ion 8.3, be void and of no further force or effect. 
 Section 8.2      Compliance With Law.  Shareholders shall comply with all applicable requirements of federal and state laws, including all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, in connection with such shareholder's ownership interest in the Company and all other laws which apply to the Company or any subsidiary of the Company or their respective businesses, assets or operations and whi ch require action or inaction on the part of the shareholder. 
 Section 8.3      Limitation on Voting Shares or Proxies.  Without limiting the provisions of Section 8.1, if a shareholder (whether individually or constituting a group, as determined by the Board of Directors), by virtue of such shareholder's ownership interest in the Company or its receipt or exercise of proxies to vote shares owned by other shareholders, would not be permitted to vote the shareholder's shares of the Company or proxies for shares of the Company in excess of a certain amount pursuant to applicable law (including by way of example, applicable state insurance regulations) but the Board of Directors determines that the excess shares or shares represented by the excess proxies are necessary to obtain a quorum, then such shareholder shall not be entitled to vote any such excess shares or proxies, and instead such excess shares or proxies may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be voted by the Company's applicable management services provider (or by another person designated by the directors) in proportion to the total shares otherwise voted on such matter.

 Section 8.4      Representations, Warranties and Covenants Made to Governmental or Regulatory Bodies.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, any representation, warranty or covenant made by a shareholder with any governmental or regulatory body in connection with such shareholder's interest in the Company or any subsidiary of the Company shall be deemed to be simultaneously made to, for the benefit of and enforceable by, the Company and any applicable su bsidiary of the Company. 
 Section 8.5      Board of Directors' Determinations.  The Board of Directors shall be empowered to make all determinations regarding the interpretation, application, enforcement and compliance with any matters referred to or contem plated by these Bylaws.

In the event of any Transfer which does not involve a transfer of securities of the Company within the meaning of Delaware law ( "Securities," and individually, a "Security") but which would cause a 5-percent Shareholder to violate a restriction on Transfers provided for in this ARTICLE IX, a sufficient amount of Securities of such 5-percent Shareholder and/or any Person whose ownership of Securities is attributed to such 5-percent Shareholder shall be deemed to be Excess Securities and shall be treated as provided in Section 9.4, including, without limitation, being deemed to constitute shares of the Company in excess of the Ownership Limit (as defined in Section 8.1 of the LLC Agreement) and be subject to Article VIII of the LLC Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, no such 5-percent Shareholder shall be required, pursuant to this Section 9.5, to dispose of any interest that is not a Security.

To the fullest extent permitted by law and without limiting any other remedies of the Company and related matters provided elsewhere in these Bylaws or in the LLC Agreement, any shareholder subject to the provisions of this ARTICLE IX who knowingly violates the provisions of this ARTICLE IX and any Persons controlling, controlled by or under common control with such shareholder shall be jointly and severally liable to the Company for, and shall indemnify and hold the Company harmless against, any and all damages suffered as a 
 
 
 32 
 
 
 
 
result of such violation, including but not limited to damages resulting from a reduction in, or elimination of, the Company's ability or right to utilize its Tax Benefits, and att orneys' and auditors' fees incurred in connection with such violation.

Shareholders of the Company may be notified of such determination through a filing with the SEC or such other method of notice as the Board of Directors may determine.

 Section 9.13      Benefits Of This Article IX.

 ARTICLE XVI 
 ARBITRATION 
 Section 16.1      Procedures for Arbitration of Disputes.  A Dispute (as defined in the LLC Agreement) or any disputes, claims or controversies relating in any way to such a Dispute or Disputes shall, on the demand of any party to such Dispute, be resolved through binding and final arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") then in effect, except as those Rules may be modified in this ARTICLE XVI.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the provisions of this ARTICLE XVI shall not apply to any request for a declaratory judgment or similar action regarding the meaning, interpretation or validity of any provision of the LLC Agreement or these Bylaws, but such request shall be heard and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction; and (b) in the event a Dispute involves both a question of the meaning, interpretation or validity of any provision of the LLC Agreement or these Bylaws and any other matter in dispute, the arbitration of such other matter in dispute, if dependent upon a determination of the meaning, interpretation or validity of any provision of the LLC Agreement or these Bylaws, shall be stayed until a final, non-appealable judgment regarding such meaning, interpretation or validity has been rendered by a  court of competent jurisdiction. 
 Section 16.2      Arbitrators.  There shall be three (3) arbitrators.  If there are only two (2) parties to the Dispute, each party shall select one (1) arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after receipt by respondent of a copy of the demand for arbitration.  If there are more than two (2) parties to the Dispute, all claimants, on the one hand, and all respondents, on the other hand, shall each select, by the vote of a majority of the claimants or the respondents, as the case may be, one (1) arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the demand for arbitration.  The arbitrators may be affiliated or interested persons of the claimants or the respondents, as the case may be.  If either a claimant (or all claimants) or a respondent (or all respondents) fail(s) to timely select an arbitrator then the party (or parties) who has selected an arbitrator may request AAA to provide a list of three (3) proposed arbitrators in accordance with the Rules (each of whom shall be neutral, impartial and unaffiliated with any party) and the party (or parties) that failed to timely appoint an arbitrator shall have ten (10) days from the date AAA provides the list to select one (1) of the three (3) arbitrators proposed by AAA. If the party (or parties) fail(s) to select the second (2nd) arbitrator by that time, the party (or parties) who have appointed the first (1st) arbitrator shall then have ten (10) days to select one (1) of the three (3) arbitrators proposed by AAA to be the second (2nd) arbitrator; and, if he/they should fail to select the second (2nd) arbitrator by such time, AAA shall select, within fifteen (15) days thereafter, one (1) of the three (3) arbitrators it had proposed as the second (2nd) arbitrator.  The two (2) arbitrators so appointed shall jointly appoint the third (3rd) and presiding arbitrator (who shall be neutral, impartial and unaffiliated with any party) within fifteen (15) days of the appointment of the second (2nd) arbitrator.  If the third (3rd) arbitrator has not been appointed within the time limit specified herein, then AAA shall provide a list of proposed arbitrators in accordance with the Rules, and the arbitrator shall be ap pointed by AAA in accordance with a listing, striking and

 ranking procedure, with each party having a limited number of strikes, excluding strikes for cause. 
 Section 16.3      Place of Arbitration .  The place of arbitration shall be Boston, Massachusetts unless otherwise agreed by the parties. 
 Section 16.4      Discovery.  There shall be only limited documentary discovery of documents directly related to the issues in dispute, as may be ordered by the arbitrators.

 Section 16.5      Awards.  In rendering an award or decision (an "Award"), the arbitrators shall be required to follow the laws of the State of Delaware.

Subject to Section 16.7, each party against which an Award assesses a monetary obligation shall pay that obligation on or before the thirtieth (30th) day following the date of such Award or such other date as such Award may provide.

Each party (or, if there are more than two (2) parties to the Dispute, all claimants, on the one hand, and all respondents, on the other hand, respectively) shall bear the costs and expenses of its (or their) selected arbitrator and the parties (or, if there are more than two (2) parties to the Dispute, all claimants, on the one hand, and all respondents, on the other hand) shall e qually bear the costs and expenses of the third (3rd) appointed arbitrator. 
 Section 16.7      Appeals.  Any Award, including but not limited to any interim Award, may be appealed pursuant to the AAA's Optional Appellate Arbitration Rules ("Appellate Rules"). An Award shall not be considered final until after the time for filing the notice of appeal pursuant to the Appellate Rules has expired. Appeals must be initiated within thirty (30) days of receipt of an Award by filing a notice of appeal with any AAA office. Following the appeal process, the decision rendered by the appeal tribunal may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  For the avoidance of doubt, and despite any contrary provision of the Appellate Rules, Section 16.6 shall apply to any appeal pursuant to this Section 16.7 and the appeal tribunal shall not render an Award that would include shifting of any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees) of any party. 
 Section 16.8      Final and Binding.  Following the expiration of the time for filing the notice of appeal, or the conclusion of the appeal process set forth in Section 16.7, an Award shall be final and binding upon the parties thereto and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy between those parties relating to the Dispute, including any claims, counterclaims, issues or accounting

presented to the arbitrators.  Judgment upon an Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, no application or appeal to any court of competent jurisdiction may be made in connection with any question of law arising in the course of arbitration or with respect to any Award, except for actions relating to enforcement of any Award issued hereunder and except for actions seeking interim or other provisional relief in aid of arbitration proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction.
