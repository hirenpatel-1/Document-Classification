(A) Special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation (i) may be called by the Chairman of the Board, if there be one, or the President, (ii) shall be called by the Chairman of the Board or the President at the request in writing of a majority of the Board of Directors, and (iii) shall be called by the Secretary upon the written request of one or more Proposing Person(s) (as defined below) who (x) have Net Long Beneficial Ownership (as defined below) of at least twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation (the "Requisite Percentage") at the time such special meeting request is validly delivered to the Secretary (the "Delivery Date") and (y) have had continuous Net Long Beneficial Ownership of at least the Requisite Percentage for a minimum of one full year prior to the Delivery Date (the "Holding Requirement"), subject to and in compliance with this Section 2.2 and, to the extent applicable to special meetings of stockholders, Section 2.8. Compliance by the Proposing Person(s) with the requirements of this Section 2.2, Section 2.8, to the extent applicable to special meetings of stockholders, and related provisions of these Bylaws shall be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, which  determination shall be binding on the Corporation and its stockholders. 
The term "Net Long Beneficial Ownership" (and its correlative terms), when used to describe the nature of a Proposing Person's ownership of common stock of the Corporation, shall mean those shares of common stock of the Corporation as to which the Proposing Person in question possesses: (i) the sole power to vote or direct the voting of, (ii) the sole economic incidents of ownership (including the sole right to profits and the sole risk of loss), and (iii) the sole power to dispose of or direct the disposition of. The number of shares calculated in accordance with clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) shall not include any shares that, directly or indirectly, underlie any "derivative security" (as such term is defined in  Rule 16a-1(c) under the Exchange Act (as defined 
 
 
below)) that constitutes a "call equivalent position" (as such term is defined in Rule 16a-1(b) under the Exchange Act) and that is, directly or indirectly, held or maintained by a  Proposing Person with respect to any shares of any class or series of shares of the Corporation. 
"Proposing Person" shall mean the holder of record of common stock of the Corporation submitting a special meeting request and the beneficial owner of common stock, if any, on whose behalf such request is made; provided, however, that, with respect to the informational requirements of Section 2.2(B), if the record holder of such common stock is making the Special Meeting Request on behalf of the beneficial owner of such common stock, the term "Proposing Person" shall be deemed to refer solely to such beneficial owner. 
(B) In order for a special meeting to be called upon stockholder request (a "Stockholder Requested Special Meeting"), one or more requests for a special meeting in the form required by this Section 2.2 must be signed by Proposing Person(s) holding the Requisite Percentage and be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation by registered mail, return receipt requested. Such request(s) shall: (i) set forth a statement of the specific purpose or purposes of the meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at such special meeting; (ii) bear the date of signature of each such Proposing Person signing the request; (iii) set forth (a) the name and address of each Proposing Person signing such request, (b) the class and the number of shares of common stock of the Corporation which are owned of record or beneficially by such Proposing Person, (c) the class and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation representing such Proposing Person's Net Long Beneficial Ownership, including a description of all securities or other instruments relating thereto, (d) documentary evidence that the Proposing Person(s) have had continuous Net Long Beneficial Ownership of the Requisite Percentage for a minimum of one full year prior to the Delivery Date, and (e) a certification that the Proposing Person satisfies the Net Long Beneficial Ownership requirement and the Holding Requirement of these Bylaws; (iv) contain the information required by Section 2.8 of these Bylaws as if incorporated in this Section 2.2; (v) contain a representation that the Proposing Person intends to hold the shares of common stock of the Corporation described in clause (iii) of this Section 2.2(B) through the date of the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting; and (vi) contain an acknowledgement by such Proposing Person that any reduction in such stockholder's Net Long Beneficial Ownership with respect to which the special meeting request relates following the Delivery Date shall constitute a revocation of such request to the extent of such reduction. Any Proposing Person may revoke a request for a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation. If, following any such revocation (or any deemed revocation hereunder), at any time before the date of the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, the remaining requests are from Proposing Person(s) holding in the aggregate less than the Requisite Percentage, the Board of Directors, in its discretion, shall cancel the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting. 
(C) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secretary shall not be required to call a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting if: (i) the Board of Directors has called or calls an annual or special meeting of stockholders to be held not later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the Delivery Date at which an identical or substantially similar item (a "Similar Item" and, for purposes of this clause (C), the removal of directors shall be deemed a "Similar Item" with respect to all items of business involving the election or removal of directors) to that included in such request will be presented; or (ii) the special meeting request (a) is received by the Secretary during the period commencing ninety (90) days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting and ending on the date of the next annual meeting; (b) contains a Similar Item to an item that was presented at any meeting of stockholders held within one year prior to the Delivery Date; (c) relates to an item of business that is not a proper subject for action by the stockholders of the Corporation under applicable law; (d) was made in a manner that involved a violation of Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act or other applicable law; or (e) does not c omply with the provisions of this Section 2.2 or, to the extent applicable, Section 2.8. 
(D) Any special meeting of stockholders, including any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, shall be held at such date, time and place, if any, as may be fixed by the Board of Directors in accordance with these Bylaws and in compliance with applicable law; provided that a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall be held within one hundred twenty (120) d ays after the Delivery Date. 
 
 
(E) Any Proposing Person who delivered a valid special meeting request shall further update and supplement such request, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided in such request shall be true and correct: (i) as of the record date for notice of the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, and (ii) as of the date that is fifteen (15) days prior to the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, and such update and supplement shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than five (5) days after the record date for the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting (in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of the record date), and not later than ten (10) days prior to the date for the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting or, if practical, any adjournment or postponement thereof (and, if not practicable, on the first practicable date prior to the date to which the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting has been adjourned or postponed) (in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of fifteen (15) days prior to the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement there of). 
(F) Business transacted at any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall be limited to the purpose(s) stated in the special meeting request; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prohibit the Board of Directors from submitting matters to a vote of the stockholders at any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting. 
 Section 2.3  Place of Meeting; Meetings by Remote Communication. (A) The Board of Directors may designate the place, if any, of any meeting of the stockholders, or may direct that the meeting be held solely by means of remote communication. If the Board of Directors does not (x) designate the place of any meeting or (y) direct that the meeting be held solely by means of remote communication, the meeting shall be held at  the principal office of the Corporation. 
(B) If authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt, stockholders and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of remote communication: (i) participate in a meeting of stockholders; and (ii) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication; provided that (a) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxyholder; (b) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such stockholders and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings; and (c) if any stockholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be maintained by the Corporation. 
 Section 2.4  Notice of Meeting. Unless otherwise required by law, a notice, stating the place of the meeting (or the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed present in person and entitled to vote at such meeting), the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting if such date is different from the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such meeting, the date and time of any meeting of stockholders and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be prepared and delivered by the Corporation not less than ten (10) days nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder of record as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail with postage thereon prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. If given by electronic transmission, such notice shall be deemed given at the time specified in Section 232 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Any previously scheduled meeting of the stockholders may be postponed, canceled or rescheduled by resolution of the Board of Directors upon public notice given prior to the date previously scheduled for such meeting  of stockholders. 
 Section 2.5  Quorum and Adjournment. Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of stockholders, provided 
 
 
that where a separate vote by a class or series (or classes or series) is required, the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of such class or series (or classes or series) shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. The stockholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. The chairman of the meeting or a majority in voting power of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time, whether or not there is such a quorum. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix as the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record  date so fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting. 
 Section 2.6  Voting; Proxies. Except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, each director shall be elected by the vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to that director's election at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present; provided that if, as of the tenth (10th) day preceding the date the Corporation first transmits its notice of meeting for such meeting to the stockholders of the Corporation, or, at any time thereafter, the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected (a "Contested Election"), the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast. For purposes of this Section 2.6, a majority of the votes cast in respect of the election of any director means that the number of votes cast "for" such director's election must exceed the number of votes cast "against" such director's election, and an abstention or broker non-vote will not count as a vote "for" or "against" a director's election. All other matters presented to the stockholders at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall, unless a different or minimum vote is required by the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, the rules or regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, or any law or regulation applicable to the Corporation or its securities, in which case such different or minimum vote shall be the applicable vote on the matter, be decided by a majority of the votes cast on such matter. Such votes may be cast in person or by proxy but no proxy shall be voted on after three years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to the Secretary of the Corporation a revocation of such proxy or a new proxy bearing a later date. The Board of Directors, in its discretion, or the chairman of the meeting, in his or her discretion, may require that any vote s cast at such meeting shall be cast by written ballot. 
 Section 2.7  Inspectors of Elections; Conduct of the Meeting. 
(A) The Board of Directors by resolution may appoint one or more inspectors, which inspector or inspectors may include individuals who serve the Corporation in other capacities, including, without limitation, as officers, employees, agents or representatives of the Corporation, to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. One or more persons may be designated as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate has been appointed to act, or if all inspectors or alternates who have been appointed are unable to act, at a meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before discharging his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The i nspectors shall have the duties prescribed by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. 
(B) The chairman of the meeting shall fix and announce at the meeting the date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting. The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of Directors, the chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to convene and (for any or no reason) to recess and/or adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts 
 
 
as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. In addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, the chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter or business was not properly brought before the meeting and, if such chairman should make such determination and declaration, any such matter or business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted or considered at the meeting. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be requi red to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.

Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver 
 
 
of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any annual or special meeting of the stockholders or the Board of Dire ctors need be specified in any waiver of notice of such meeting. 
 Section 6.6  Audits. The accounts, books and records of the Corporation shall be audited upon the conclusion of each fiscal year by an independent certified public accountant, and it shall be the duty  of the Board of Directors to cause such audit to be made annually.

No formal action shall be required of the Board of Directors or the stockholders to make any such resignation effective. 
 Section 6.8  Indemnification and Insurance. (A) Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while serving as a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, against all expense, liability and loss (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that except as provided in paragraph (B) of this Section 6.8 of this Bylaw with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or  part thereof) was authorized in the first instance by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. 
(B) If a claim under paragraph (A) of this Section 6.8 of this Bylaw is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, or if a claim for any advancement of expenses under this Section 6.8 is not paid in full within thirty days after the Corporation has received a statement or statements requesting such amounts to be advanced, the claimant may at any time thereafter (but not before) bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim to the fullest extent permitted by law. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, any committee of the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, any committee of the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not m et the applicable standard of conduct. 
(C) The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this Bylaw shall not be exclusive o f any other right which any person 
 
 
may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. 
(D) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, l iability or loss under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. 
(E) The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and rights to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Bylaw with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation. 
(F) The right to indemnification conferred in this Bylaw on the persons entitled thereto shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that if the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware requires the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, such advancement shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined t hat such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Bylaw or otherwise. 
(G) For the avoidance of doubt, claimant's right to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided under this Article VI shall (i) vest at the time that such claimant becomes a director or officer of the Corporation or at the time such claimant becomes a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, at the request of the Corporation and (ii) continue as to the claimant even though such claimant m ay have ceased to be a director or officer of the Corporation. 
(H) Any amendment or modification of these Bylaws affecting a claimant's right to indemnification or the advancement of expenses provided under this Article VI shall not alter the claimant's right to indemnification or the advancement of expenses with respect to such claimant's conduct prior to the amendment or modification, without the express written conse nt of such claimant. 
 Section 6.9  Forum Selection. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of this Section 6.9.
