Failure to hold an annual meeting does not invalidate the Corporation's existence or affect any otherwise valid acts of the Corporation. 
 Section 2.3      Special Meetings . 
 (a)     Either the president or a majority of the Board of Directors may call a special meeting of stockholders, which meeting shall be held at such place, date and time as the president o r the Board of Directors, whichever has called the meeting, may designate. 
 (b)     A special meeting of stockholders for a particular purpose and for particular matters to be acted on shall be called by the secretary upon the written request (each, a "Special Meeting Request") of stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting (the "Special Meeting Percentage"), subject to and in  accordance with the following provisions. 
 (i)     Stockholders meeting the Special Meeting Percentage shall deliver to the secretary, by registered mail, return receipt requested, a Special Meeting Request. The Special Meeting Req uest shall: (1) set forth the purpose of, and the matters to be acted upon at, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the meeting; (2) bear the date of signature of each stockholder (or its agent duly authorized in writing) making the Special Meeting Request; (3) set forth the name and address, as they appear in the Corporation's books, of each stockholder making the Special Meeting Request (or on behalf of which it is signed); (4) set forth the class, series and number of all shares of stock of the Corporation which are owned of record and beneficially by each stockholder making the Special Meeting Request (or on behalf of which it is signed); (5) set forth all information relating to each stockholder making the Special Meeting Request (or on behalf of which it is signed) and each matter proposed to be acted on at the meeting which would be required to be disclosed in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the election of Directors in an election contest (even if an election contest is not involved), or would otherwise be required in connection with a solicitation of proxies, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A (or any successor provision) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Exchange Act"), or that would otherwise be required to be disclosed pursuant to the rules of any national securities exchange on which any securities of the Corporation are listed or traded; and (6) include all other documentation and set forth all other information required by Section 2.14. In addition, any stockholder(s) signing a Special Meeting Request (or on behalf of which it is signed) must comply with the ownership requirements set forth in Section 2.14.1(b)(ii)(A) and hold a certificate or certificates evidencing the aggregate number of shares of stock of the Corporation referenced therein as of the time the Special Meeting Request is sent, as of the Special Meeting Percentage Calculation Date (as defined in Section 2.3(b)(ii)), as of the Meeting Record Date (as defined in Section 2.3(b)(iii) ) and as of the date of the applicable special meeting. 
 (ii)     If the Board of Directors preliminarily determines that a Special Meeting Request meets the requirements of Section 2.3(b)(i) and appears to represent, in the aggregate, the Special Meeting Percentage (the date of such determination, the "Preliminary Determination Date"), the Board of Directors shall fix a record date (the "Special Meeting Percentage Calculation Date") to make a final determination as to whether stockholders making the Special Meeting Request(s) satisfy the Special Meeting Percentage. The Special Meeting Percentage Calculation Date shall not precede and shall not be more than ten (10) days after the close of business on the date on which the resolution fixing the Special Meeting Percentage Calculation Date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If the Board of Directors fails to fix a Special Meeting Percentage Calculation Date within ten (10) days after the Preliminary Determination Date, then the close of business on the tenth (10th) day after the Preliminary Determination Date shall be the Special Meeting Percentage Calculation Date. 
 (iii)     Upon a final determination by the Board of Directors that the Special Meeting Request(s) referenced in Section 2.3(b)(ii), together with any additional Special Meeting Request(s) received by the Secretary prior to such determination being made that set forth the same purpose of, and matters to be acted on at, the meeting, represent, in the aggregate, the Special Meeting Percentage, which determination shall occur within ten (10) days after the Special Meeting Percentage Calculation Date (the "Final Determination Date"), the secretary shall inform the stockholders that are signatories to such Special Meeting Request(s) of the reasonably estimated costs of preparing and mailing a notice of the meeting. Upon receipt by the secretary of payment of such reasonably estimated costs from or on behalf of the requesting 
 
 
 -2- 
 
 
 
 
stockholders, the secretary shall give notice of the meeting to all stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, which notice shall state the purpose or purposes of the meeting  and shall otherwise be in accordance with Section 2.4. 
 (c)     A special meeting of stockholders called by the secretary pursuant to Section 2.3(b) shall be held at such place, date and time as may be designated by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that the date of any such special meeting shall be not more than ninety (90) days after the record date for such meeting (the "Meeting Record Date"); and further, that if the Board of Directors fails to fix a Meeting Record Date that is a date within thirty (30) days after the Final Determination Date, the close of business on the thirtieth (30th) day after the Final Determination Date shall be the Meeting Record Date; and further, that if the Board of Directors fails to designate a date, time or place for such special meeting within ten (10) days after the Final Determination Date, such special meeting shall be held on the ninetieth (90th) day after the Meeting Record Date or, if such ninetieth (90th) day is not a business day, on the first (1st) business day preceding such ninetieth (90th) day, at 2:00 p.m. local time, at the principal executive office of the Corporation . 
 Section 2.4      Notice of Regular or Special Meetings. Notice given in writing or by electronic transmission specifying the place, day and hour of any regular or special meeting, the purposes of the meeting, to the extent required by law to be provided, and all other matters required by law shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote, sent to his or her address appearing on the books of the Corporation or theretofore given by him or her to the Corporation for the purpose of notice, by presenting it to such stockholder personally, by leaving it at the stockholder's residence or usual place of business or by any other means permitted by Maryland law. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given once deposited in the U.S. mail addressed to the stockholder at his or her post office address as it appears on the records of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid. If transmitted electronically, such notice shall be deemed to be given when transmitted to the stockholder by an electronic transmission to any address or number of the stockholder at which the stockholder receives electronic transmissions. It shall be the duty of the secretary to give notice of each meeting of the stockholders. The Corporation may give a single notice to all stockholders who share an address, which single notice shall be effective to any stockholder at such address, unless a stockholder objects to receiving such single notice or revokes a prior consent to receiving such single notice. Failure to give notice of any meeting to one or more stockholders, or any irregularity in such notice, shall not affect the validity of any meeting fixed in accord ance with this ARTICLE II or the validity of any proceedings at any such meeting. 
 Section 2.5      Notice of Adjourned Meetings.  It shall not be necessary to give notice of the time and place of any adjourned meeting or of the business to be transacted thereat other than by announcement at the meeting at whi ch such adjournment is taken.

 Section 2.7      Organization of Stockholder Meetings. Every meeting of stockholders shall be conducted by an individual appointed by the Board of Directors to be chairperson of the meeting or, in the absence of such appointment or the absence of the appointed individual, by one of the following officers present at the meeting in the following order: the chairman of the board, if there be one, a Managing Director (in their order of seniority), the president, the vice presidents (in their order of seniority), the secretary, or, in the absence of such officers, a chairperson chosen by the stockholders by the vote of holders of shares of stock of the Corporation representing a majority of the votes cast on such appointment by stockholders present in person or represented by proxy. The secretary, an assistant secretary or a person appointed by the Board of Directors or, in the absence of such appointment, a person appointed by the chairperson of the meeting shall act as secretary of the meeting and record the minutes of the meeting. If the secretary presides as chairperson at a meeting of the stockholders, then the secretary shall not also act as secretary of the meeting and record the minutes of the meeting. The order of business and all other matters of procedure at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined by the chairperson of the meeting. The chairperson of the meeting may prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and take such action as, in the discretion of such chairperson, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation: (a) restricting admission to the time set for the commencement of the meeting; (b) limiting attendance at the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized proxies or other such persons as the chairperson of the meeting may determine; (c) limiting participation at the meeting on any matter to stockholders of record of the Corporation entitled to vote on such matter, their duly authorized proxies or other such persons as the chairperson of the meeting may determine; (d) limiting the time allotted to questions or comments by participants; (e) determining when and for how long the polls should be opened and when the polls should be closed; (f) maintaining order and security at the meeting; (g) removing any stockholder or other person who refuses to comply with meeting procedures, rules or guidelines as set forth by the chairperson of the meeting; (h) concluding a meeting or recessing or adjourning the meeting to a later date and time and at a place announced at the meeting; and (i) complying with any state and local laws and regulations concerning safety and security. Without limiting the generality of the powers of the chairperson of the meeting pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the chairperson may adjourn any meeting of stockholders for any reason deemed necessary by the chairperson, including, without limitation, if (i) no quorum is present for the transaction of the business, (ii) the Board of Directors or the chairperson of the meeting determines that adjournment is necessary or appropriate to enable the stockholders to consider fully information that the Board of Directors or the chairperson of the meeting determines has not been made sufficiently or timely available to stockholders or (iii) the Board of Directors or the chairperson of the meeting determines that adjournment is otherwise in the best interests of the Corporation. Unless otherwise determined by the chairperson of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the general r ules of parliamentary procedure or any otherwise established rules of order. 
 Section 2.8      Quorum. At any meeting of stockholders, the presence in person or by proxy of stockholders entitled to cast one-third (1/3) of all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting shall constitute a quorum. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, at any special meeting of stockholders called upon the written request of stockholders pursuant to 
 
 
 -4- 
 
 
 
 
Section 2.3(b), the presence in person or by proxy of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting shall constitute a quorum. This section shall not affect any requirement under any statute or the charter of the Corporation (the "Charter") for the vote necessary for the adoption of any measure. If, however, such quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the stockholders, the chairperson of the meeting shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time without the Corporation having to set a new record date or provide any additional notice of such meeting, subject to any obligation of the Corporation to give notice pursuant to Section 2.5. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. The stockholders present, either in person or by proxy, at a meeting of stockholders which has been duly called and convened and at which a quorum was established may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum then being present at the meeting.

 Section 2.14.2      Stockholder Nominations or Other Proposals Causing Covenant Breaches or Defaults. At the same time as the submission of any stockholder nomination or proposal of other business to be considered at a stockholders meeting that, if approved and implemented by the Corporation, would cause the Corporation or any subsidiary (as defined in Section 2.14.5(c)) of the Corporation to be in breach of any covenant of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation or otherwise cause a default (in any case, with or without notice or lapse of time) in any existing debt instrument or agreement of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation or other material contract or agreement of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation, the proponent stockholder or stockholders shall submit to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation (a) evidence satisfactory to the Board of Directors of the lender's or contracting party's willingness to waive the breach of covenant or default or (b) a detailed plan for repayment of the indebtedness to the lender or curing the contractual breach or default and satisfying any resulting damage claim, specifically identifying the actions to be taken and the source of funds, which plan must be satisfactory to the Board of Directors in its discretion, and evidence of the availability to the Corporation of substitute credit or contractual arrangements similar to the credit or contractual arrangements which are implicated by the stockholder nomination or other proposal that are at least as favorable to the Corporation, as determined by the Board of Directors in its discretion. As an example and not as a limitation, at the time these Bylaws are being amended and restated, the Corporation is party to a secured revolving credit facility that may prohibit certain changes of control of the Corporation without the approval of the lenders; accordingly, a stockholder nomination or proposal which implicates such provisions shall be accompanied by a waiver thereof duly executed by the required lenders or by evidence satisfactory to the Board of Directors of the availability of funding to the Corporation to repay outstanding indebtedness under this credit facility and of the availability of a new credit facility on terms as favorable to the Corporation as the existing credit facility. As a further example and not as a limitation, at the time these Bylaws are being amended and restated, the Corporation or its subsidiaries are parties to lease, management and related agreements with Senior Housing Properties Trust or its subsidiaries ("Senior Housing"). Those agreements may prohibit certain changes of control of the Corporation without the approval of Senior Housing. Accordingly, a stockholder nomination or proposal which implicates such provisions shall be accompanied by a waiver thereof duly executed by the applicable Senior Housing entity or by evidence satisfactory to the Board of Directors of the availability of alternative facilities for lease and operation by the Corporation on terms as favorable to the Corporation as the applicable arrangement and of funds for the payment by the Corporation of any amounts required under the applicable agreement or otherwise as a result of any breach or termination of the applicable  agreement with Senior Housing. 
 Section 2.14.3      Stockholder Nominations or Other Proposals Requiring Governmental Action. If (a) any stockholder nomination or proposal of other business to be considered at a stockholders meeting could not be considered or, if approved, implemented by the Corporation  without the Corporation, any subsidiary of the Corporation, the proponent 
 
 
 -13- 
 
 
 
 
stockholder, any Proposed Nominee of such stockholder, any Stockholder Associated Person of such stockholder, the holder of proxies or their respective affiliates or associates filing with or otherwise notifying or obtaining the consent, approval or other action of any federal, state, municipal or other governmental or regulatory body (a "Governmental Action") or (b) such stockholder's ownership of shares of stock of the Corporation or any solicitation of proxies or votes or holding or exercising proxies by such stockholder, any Proposed Nominee of such stockholder, any Stockholder Associated Person of such stockholder, or their respective affiliates or associates would require Governmental Action, then, at the same time as the submission of any stockholder nomination or proposal of other business to be considered at a stockholders meeting, the proponent stockholder or stockholders shall submit to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation (1) evidence satisfactory to the Board of Directors that any and all Governmental Action has been given or obtained, including, without limitation, such evidence as the Board of Directors may require so that any Proposed Nominee may be determined to satisfy any suitability or other requirements or (2) if such evidence was not obtainable from a governmental or regulatory body by such time despite the proponent stockholder's diligent and best efforts, a detailed plan for making or obtaining the Governmental Action prior to the election of any such Proposed Nominee or the implementation of such proposal, which plan must be satisfactory to the Board of Directors in its discretion. As an example and not as a limitation, at the time these Bylaws are being amended and restated, the Corporation holds a controlling ownership position in a company formed and licensed as an insurance company in the State of Indiana. The laws of the State of Indiana have certain regulatory requirements for any person who seeks to control (as defined under Indiana law) a company which itself controls an insurance company domiciled in the State of Indiana, including by exercising proxies representing ten percent (10%) or more of its voting securities. Accordingly, a stockholder who seeks to exercise proxies for a nomination or a proposal affecting the governance of the Corporation shall obtain any applicable approvals from the Indiana insurance regulatory authorities prior to exercising such proxies. Similarly, as a further example and not as a limitation, at the time these Bylaws are being amended and restated, the Corporation operates healthcare facilities in various states; such facilities are governed by and subject to the regulatory and licensing requirements of the state in which such facility is located. The licensing terms or regulatory regime of certain states with jurisdiction over the Corporation may require that certain consents or approvals be obtained prior to the Corporation considering or implementing certain actions, including potentially requiring that a Proposed Nominee obtain regulatory approval or consent prior to being nominated for or elected as a Director. Accordingly, a stockholder nomination or other proposal that, if approved, would require the Corporation to obtain the consent or approval of a state authority due to the fact that the Corporation operates licensed healthcare facilities in such state, shall be accompanied by evidence that the stockholder or Proposed Nominee has either secured the required approvals or consents from all applicable state regulatory authorities or if such required approvals have not been obtained, then the stockholder nomination or other proposal shall be accompanied by a copy of any applications or forms required to be completed by the Proposed Nominee or stockholder as submitted or to be submitted to the applicable state regulatory authorities so that the Board of Directors may determine the likelihood that the stockholder or the Proposed Nominee, as applicable, will receive any such required approval.

 Section 2.14.5      General . 
 (a)     If information submitted pursuant to this Section 2.14 by any stockholder proposing a nominee for election as a Director or any proposal for other business at a meeting of stockholders shall be deemed by the Board of Directors incomplete or inaccurate, any authorized officer or the Board of Directors or any committee thereof may treat such information as not having been provided in accordance with this Section 2.14. Any notice submitted by a stockholder pursuant to this Section 2.14 that is deemed by the Board of Directors inaccurate, incomplete or otherwise fails to satisfy completely any provision of this Section 2.14 shall be deemed defective and shall thereby render all proposals and nominations set forth in such notice defective. Upon written request by the secretary or the Board of Directors or any committee thereof (which may be made from time to time), any stockholder proposing a nominee for election as a Director or any proposal for other business at a meeting of stockholders shall provide, within three (3) business days after such request (or such other  period as may be 
 
 
 -15-

If a stockholder fails to provide such written verification, information or update within such period, the secretary or any other authorized officer or the Board of Directors may treat the information which was previously provided and to which the verification, request or update relates as not having been provided in accordance with this Section 2.14. It is the responsibility of a stockholder who wishes to make a nomination or other proposal to comply with the requirements of Section 2.14; nothing in this Section 2.14.5(a) or otherwise shall create any duty of the Corporation, the Board of Directors or any committee thereof nor any officer of the Corporation to inform a stockholder that the information submitted pursuant to this Section 2.14 by or on behalf of such stockholder is incomplete or inaccurate or not otherwise in accordance with this Section 2.14 nor require the Corporation, the Board of Directors, any committee of the Board of Directors or any officer of the Corporation to request clarification or updating of information provided by any stockholder, but the Board of Directors, a committee thereof or the secretary acting on behalf of the Board of Directors or a committee, may do so in its, h is or her discretion. 
 (b)     Only such individuals who are nominated in accordance with this Section 2.14 shall be eligible for election by stockholders as Directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been properly brought before the meeting in accordance with this Section 2.14. The chairperson of the meeting and the Board of Directors shall each have the power to determine whether a nomination or any other business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with this Section 2.14 and, if any proposed nomination or other business is determined not to be in compliance with this Section 2.14, to declare that such defective nomination or p roposal be disregarded.

 (d)     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.14, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable legal requirements, including, without 
 
 
 -16- 
 
 
 
 
limitation, applicable requirements of state law and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 2.14. Nothing in this Section 2.14 shall be deemed to require that a stockholder nomination of an individual for election to the Board of Directors or a stockholder proposal relating to other bu siness be included in the Corporation's proxy statement, except as may be required by law. 
 (e)     The Board of Directors may from time to time require any individual nominated to serve as a Director to agree in writing with regard to matters of business ethics and confidentiality while such nominee serves as a Director, such agreement to be on the terms and in a form determined satisfactory by the Board of Directors, as amended and supplemented from time to time in the discretion of the Board of Directors. The terms of any such agreement may be substantially similar to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics of the Corporation or  any similar code promulgated by the Corporation or may differ from or supplement such Code.

 Section 2.16      Proposals of Business Which Are Not Proper Matters For Action By Stockholders. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, subject to applicable law, any stockholder proposal for business the subject matter or effect of which would be within the exclusive purview of the Board of Directors, shall be deemed not to be a matter upon which the stockholders are entitled to vote. The Board of Directors in its discretion shall be entitled to determine whether a stockholder proposal for business is not a matter upon which the stockholders are entitled to vote pursuant to this Section 2.16, and its decision shall be final and binding unless determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been made in bad faith.

In case of failure to elect Directors at an annual meeting of the stockh olders, the incumbent Directors shall hold over and 
 
 
 -17- 
 
 
 
 
continue to direct the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation until they may resign or until their successors are elected and qualify. The failure of stockholders to elect Directors at an annual meeting of stockholders shall not cause vacancies on the Board of Directors requiring the officers of the Corporation to call a special meeting of stockholders to elect Directors unless all Directors, including holdover Directors, are unwilling or unable to continue to serve. 
 Section 3.2      Independent Directors and Managing Directors. A majority of the Directors holding office shall at all times be Independent Directors; provided, however, that upon a failure to comply with this requirement as a result of the creation of a temporary vacancy which shall be filled by an Independent Director, whether as a result of enlargement of the Board of Directors or the resignation, removal or death of a Director who is an Independent Director, such requirement shall not be applicable. An "Independent Director" is one who is not an employee of the Corporation or The RMR Group LLC (or its permitted successors or assigns under the Amended and Restated Business Management and Shared Services Agreement between the Corporation and The RMR Group LLC, as the same may be in effect from time to time) ("RMR LLC"), who is not involved in the Corporation's day to day activities and who meets the qualifications of an independent director (not including the specific independence requirements applicable only to members of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors) under the applicable rules of each securities exchange upon which shares of stock of the Corporation are listed for trading and the SEC, as those requirements may be amended from time to time. If the number of Directors, at any time, is set at less than five (5), at least one (1) Director shall be a Managing Director. So long as the number of Directors shall be five (5) or greater, at least two (2) Directors shall be Managing Directors. "Managing Directors" shall mean Directors who have been employees, officers or directors of the Corporation or RMR LLC or involved in the day to day activities of the Corporation for at least one (1) year prior to their election. If at any time the Board of Directors shall not be comprised of a majority of Independent Directors, the Board of Directors shall take such actions as will cure such condition; provided that the fact that the Board of Directors does not have a majority of Independent Directors or has not taken such action at any time or from time to time shall not affect the validity of any action taken by the Board of Directors. If at any time the Board of Directors shall not be comprised of a number of Managing Directors as is required under this Section 3.2, the Board of Directors shall take such actions as will cure such condition; provided that the fact that the Board of Directors does not have the requisite number of Managing Directors or has not taken such action at any time or from time to time shall not affect the vali dity of any action taken by the Board of Directors. 
 Section 3.3      Number and Tenure. The Board of Directors may establish, increase or decrease the number of Directors; provided, that the number thereof shall never be less than the minimum number required by the Maryland General Corporation Law (the "MGCL") (or any successor statute), nor more than seven (7); and further, provided, that the tenure of office of a Director shall not be affected by any decrease in the number of Directors.

 Section 3.6      Notice. Notice of any special meeting shall be given by written notice delivered personally or by electronic mail, telephoned, facsimile transmitted, overnight couriered (with proof of delivery) or mailed to each Director at his or her business or residence address.

The Directors present at a meeting of the Board of Directors which has been duly called and convened and at which a quorum was established may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal from the meeting of such number of Directors as would otherwise result in less than a quorum then being present at the meeting. 
 Section 3.8      Voting. The action of the majority of the Directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is or was present shall be the action of the Board of Directors, unless

If enough Directors have withdrawn from a meeting to leave fewer than are required to establish a quorum, but the meeting is not adjourned, the action of the majority of that number of Directors necessary to constitute a quorum at such meeting shall be the action of the Board of Directors, unless the concurrence of a greater proportion is required for such action by applicable law, the Charte r or these Bylaws. 
 Section 3.9      Telephone Meetings. Directors may participate in a meeting by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment if all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time.

 Section 3.11      Waiver of Notice.

 Section 3.12      Vacancies. If for any reason any or all the Directors cease to be Directors, such event shall not terminate the Corporation or affect these Bylaws or the powers of the remaining Directors hereunder (even if fewer than three Directors remain). Except as may be provided by the Board of Directors in setting the terms of any class or series of preferred stock, any vacancy on the Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority of the remaining Directors, even if the remaining Directors do not constitute a quorum. Any Director elected to fill a vacancy, whether occurring due to an increase in size of the Board of Directors or by the death, resignation or removal of any Director, shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of Directors in which the vacancy occurred or was created and until a successor is elected and qualifies. 
 Section 3.13      Compensation. Directors shall be entitled to receive such reasonable compensation for their services as Directors as the Board of Directors may determine from time to time.

 ARTICLE VIII 
   REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND DISCLOSURE 
 Section 8.1      Actions Requiring Regulatory Compliance Implicating the Corporation. If any stockholder (whether individually or constituting a group, as determined by the Board of Directors), by virtue of such stockholder's ownership interest in the Corporation or actions taken by the stockholder affecting the Corporation, triggers the application of any requirement or regulation of any federal, state, municipal or other governmental or regulatory body on the Corporation or any subsidiary (for purposes of this ARTICLE VIII, as defined in Section 2.14.5(c)) of the Corporation or any of their respective businesses, assets or operations, including, without limitation, any obligations to make or obtain a Governmental Action (as defined in Section 2.14.3), such stockholder shall promptly take all actions necessary and fully cooperate with the Corporation to ensure that such requirements or regulations are satisfied without restricting, imposing additional obligations on or in any way limiting the business, assets, operations or prospects of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation. If the stockholder fails or is otherwise unable to promptly take such actions so to cause satisfaction of such requirements or regulations, the stockholder shall promptly divest a sufficient number of shares of stock of the Corporation necessary to cause the application of such requirement or regulation to not apply to the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation. If the stockholder fails to cause such satisfaction or divest itself of such sufficient number of shares of stock of the Corporation by not later than the tenth (10th) day after triggering such requirement or regulation referred to in this Section 8.1, then any shares of stock of the Corporation beneficially owned by such stockholder at and in excess of the level triggering the application of such requirement or regulation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be deemed to constitute shares held in violation of the ownership limitations set forth in Article VI of the Charter and be subject to the provisions of Article VI of the Charter and any actions triggering the application of such a requirement or regulation may be deemed by the Corporation to be of no force or effect. Moreover, if the stockholder who triggers the application of any regulation or requirement fails to satisfy the requirements or regulations or to take curative actions within such ten (10) day period, the Corporation may take all other actions which the Board of Directors 
 
 
 -27- 
 
 
 
 
deems appropriate to require compliance or to preserve the value of the Corporation's assets; and the Corporation may charge the offending stockholder for the Corporation's costs a nd expenses as well as any damages which may result to the Corporation. 
As an example and not as a limitation, at the time these Bylaws are being amended and restated, the Corporation holds a controlling ownership position in a company formed and licensed as an insurance company in the State of Indiana. The laws of the State of Indiana have certain regulatory requirements for any person who seeks to control (as defined under Indiana law) a company which itself controls an insurance company domiciled in the State of Indiana, including by exercising proxies representing ten percent (10%) or more of the Corporation's voting securities. Accordingly, if a stockholder seeks to exercise proxies for a matter to be voted upon at a meeting of the stockholders without having obtained any applicable approvals from the Indiana insurance regulatory authorities, such proxies representing ten percent (10%) or more of the Corporation's voting securities will, subject to Sect ion 8.3, be void and of no further force or effect. 
As a further example and not as a limitation, at the time these Bylaws are being amended and restated, the Corporation operates healthcare facilities in various states which are subject to state regulatory and licensing requirements in each such state. Under the licensing terms or regulatory regime of certain states with jurisdiction over the Corporation, a stockholder which acquires a controlling equity position in the Corporation may be required to obtain regulatory approval or consent prior to or as a result of obtaining such ownership. Accordingly, if a stockholder which acquires a controlling equity position in the Corporation that would require the stockholder or the Corporation to obtain the consent or approval of a state authority due to the fact that the Corporation operates licensed healthcare facilities in such state, and the stockholder refuses to provide the Corporation with information required to be submitted to the applicable state authority or if the state authority declines to approve the stockholder's ownership of the Corporation, then, in either event, shares of stock of the Corporation owned by the stockholder necessary to reduce its ownership to an amount so that the stockholder's ownership of shares of stock of the Corporation would not require it to provide any such information to, or for consent to be obtained from, the state authority, may be deemed by the Board of Directors to be shares of stock held in violation of the ownership limitation in Article VI of the Charter and shall be subject to the provisions of Article VI of the Charter. 
 Section 8.2      Compliance With Law. Stockholders shall comply with all applicable requirements of federal and state laws, including all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, in connection with such stockholder's ownership interest in the Corporation and all other laws which apply to the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation or their respective businesses, assets or operati ons and which require action or inaction on the part of the stockholder. 
 Section 8.3      Limitation on Voting Shares of Stock or Proxies. Without limiting the provisions of Section 8.1, if a stockholder (whether individually or constituting a group, as determined by the Board of Directors), by virtue of such stockholder's ownership interest in the Corporation or its receipt or exercise of proxies to vote shares of stock of the Corporation owned 
 
 
 -28- 
 
 
 
 
by other stockholders, would not be permitted to vote such shares or proxies for such shares in excess of a certain amount pursuant to applicable law (including by way of example, applicable state insurance regulations) but the Board of Directors determines that the excess shares or shares represented by the excess proxies are necessary to obtain a quorum, then such stockholder shall not be entitled to vote any such excess shares or proxies, and instead such excess shares or proxies may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be voted by the Board of Directors (or by another person designated by the Board of Directors) in proportion to the total shares otherwise voted on such matter. 
 Section 8.4      Representations, Warranties and Covenants Made to Governmental or Regulatory Bodies. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any representation, warranty or covenant made by a stockholder with any governmental or regulatory body in connection with such stockholder's interest in the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation shall be deemed to be simultaneously made to, for the benefit of and enforceable by, the Corporation and any ap plicable subsidiary of the Corporation. 
 Section 8.5      Board of Directors' Determinations. The Board of Directors shall be empowered to make all determinations regarding the interpretation, application, enforcement and compliance with any matters referred to or contemp lated by these Bylaws.

 Section 16.2      Arbitrators. There shall be three (3) arbitrators. If there are only two (2) parties to the Dispute, each party shall select one (1) arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after receipt by respondent of a copy of the demand for arbitration. The arbitrators may be affiliated or interested persons of the parties. If there are more than two (2) parties to the Dispute, all claimants, on the one hand, and all respondents, on the other hand, shall each select, by the vote of a majority of the claimants or the respondents, as the case may be, one (1) arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the demand for arbitration. The arbitrators may be affiliated or interested persons of the claimants or the respondents, as the case may be. If either a claimant (or all claimants) or a respondent (or all respondents) fail(s) to timely select an arbitrator then the party (or parties) who has selected an arbitrator may request AAA to provide a list of three (3) proposed arbitrators in accordance with the Rules (each of whom shall be neutral, impartial and unaffiliated with any party) and the party (or parties) that failed to timely appoint an arbitrator shall have ten (10) days from the date AAA provides the list to select one (1) of the three (3) arbitrators proposed by AAA. If the party (or parties) fail(s) to select the second (2nd) arbitrator by that time, the party (or parties) who have appointed the first (1st) arbitrator shall then have ten (10) days to select one (1) of the three (3) arbitrators proposed by AAA to be the second (2nd) arbitrator; and, if he/they should fail to select the second (2nd) arbitrator by such time, AAA shall select, within fifteen (15) days thereafter, one (1) of the three (3) arbitrators it had proposed as the second (2nd) arbitrator. The two (2) arbitrators so appointed shall jointly appoint the third (3rd) and presiding arbitrator (who shall be neutral, impartial and unaffiliated with any party) within fifteen (15) days of the appointment of the second (2nd) arbitrator. If the third (3rd) arbitrator has not been appointed within the time limit specified herein, then AAA shall provide a list of proposed arbitrators in accordance with the Rules, and the arbitrator shall be appointed by AAA in accordance with a listing, striking and ranking procedure, with each party having a limited numbe r of strikes, excluding strikes for cause.
