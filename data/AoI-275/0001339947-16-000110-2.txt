 ARTICLE VI 
 INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS 
 (1)      Right to Indemnification. The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is involved in or is threatened to be involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer (including, without limitation, a trustee) of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (such person, an "indemnitee"), to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment and unless applicable law otherwise requires, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees), actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as provided in Section (7) of this Article VI with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall indemnify an indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by the indemnitee, if and only if the Board of Directors authorized the bringing of the action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) in advance of the c ommencement of the proceeding. 
 (2)      Successful Defense. To the extent that an indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section (1) of this Article VI, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in  connection therewith. 
 
 
 5 
 
 
 
 
 (3)      Advance Payment of Expenses. Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a present or former Director or officer of the Corporation in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding;   provided ,   however, that, to the extent required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, a present Director or officer of the Corporation shall be required to submit to the Corporation, prior to the payment of such expenses, an undertaking (an "undertaking") by or on behalf of such Director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined in a final, non-appealable judicial decision that such Director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation for  such expenses as authorized in this Article VI;   provided ,   further, that a former Director or officer of the Corporation shall be required to submit to the Corporation, prior to the payment of such expenses, an undertaking to the extent an undertaking would be required of a present Director or officer of the Corporation pursuant to this Section (3). 
 (4)      Not Exclusive. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other sections of this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any statute, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. Without limiting the foregoing, the Corporation is authorized to enter into an agreement with any Director or officer of the Corporation providing indemnification for such person against expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement that result from any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including, without limitation, any action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation, that arises by reason of the fact that such person is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, to the fullest extent allowed by law, except that no such agreement shall provide for indemnification for any actions that constitute fraud, actual di shonesty or willful misconduct. 
 (5)      Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under  the provisions of this Article VI. 
 (6)      Certain Definitions. For the purposes of this Article VI, (a) any Director, officer or employee of the Corporation who shall serve or has served as a director or officer of any other corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise of which the Corporation, directly or indirectly, is or was a stockholder or creditor, or in which the  Corporation is or was in any way interested, or (b) any current or former director or officer of 
 
 
 6 
 
 
 
 
any subsidiary corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise wholly owned by the Corporation, shall be deemed to be serving as such director or officer at the request of the Corporation, unless the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall determine otherwise. In all other instances where any person shall serve or has served as a director or officer of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise of which the Corporation is or was a stockholder or creditor, or in which it is or was otherwise interested, if it is not otherwise established that such person is or was serving as such director or officer at the request of the Corporation, the Board of Directors of the Corporation may determine whether such service is or was at the request of the Corporation, and it shall not be necessary to show any actual or prior request for such service. For purposes of this Article VI, references to a corporation include all constituent corporations absorbed in a consolidation or merger (including any constituent of a constituent) as well as the resulting or surviving corporation so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such a constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VI with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would if he had served the resulting or surviving corporation in the same capacity. For purposes of this Article VI, references to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a Director or officer of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such Director or officer with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries, and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Article VI. 
 (7)      Proceedings to Enforce Rights to Indemnification. (a) If a claim under Section (1) of this Article VI is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, or a claim under Section (3) of this Article VI is not paid in full by the Corporation within 30 days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. Any such written claim under Section (1) of this Article VI shall include such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the indemnitee and reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification. Any written claim under Sections (1), (2) and (3) of this Article VI shall include reasonable documentation of the expenses incurred by the indemnitee. 
 (a)     If successful in whole or in part in any suit brought pursuant to Section (7)(a) of this Article VI, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall also be entitled to be paid and indemnified for the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. 
 (b)     In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right 
 
 
 7 
 
 
 
 
to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of ex penses, under this Article VI or otherwise shall be on the Corporation. 
 (8)      Preservation of Rights. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VI shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director or officer of the Corporation, or has ceased to serve at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. Any repeal or modification of this Article VI by the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a Director or officer of the Corporation, or any person serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, tr ust or other enterprise, existing at the time of such repeal or modification. 
 ARTICLE VII 
 DIRECTOR LIABILITY TO THE CORPORATION 
 (1)      Limitation on Liability. A Director's liability to the Corporation for breach of duty to the Corporation or its stockholders shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. In particular, no Director of the Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (a) for any breach of the Director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (b) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct o r a knowing violation of law, (c) under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the State 
 
 
 8 
 
 
 
 
of Delaware, as the same exists or hereafter may be amended, or (d) for any transaction from which the Director derived an improper personal benefit. 
 (2)      Repeal or Modification. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing Section (1) by the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a Di rector of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification. 
 (3)      Amendment. If the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the liability of directors, then a Director of the Corporation shall be free of liability to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as so amended. 
 ARTICLE VIII
