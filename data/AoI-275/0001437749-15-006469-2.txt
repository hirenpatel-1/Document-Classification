 4.4   On or before the Redemption Date in respect of any Series I Class A Preferred Stock, each holder of such shares shall surrender the required certificate or certificates representing such shares to the Corporation in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and upon the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price for such shares shall be made payable, in the manner provided in Section 5.5 hereof, to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof, and each surrendered share certificate shall be canceled and retired.

The deposit shall constitute full payment for the shares to their holders, and from and after the date of the deposit the redeemed share shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding, and holders thereof shall cease to be shareholders with respect to such shares and shall have no rights with respect thereto except the rights to receive from the bank or trust company payments of the Redemption price of the shares, without interest, upon surrender of their certificates thereof. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of one year following the Redemption Date shall be released or repaid to the Corporation, after which the former holders of shares called for redemption shall be entitled to receive payment of the Redemption Price in respect of their shares only from the Corporation.

 Part 5 - Conversion. 
   
 5.1    For the purposes of conversion of the Series I Class A Preferred Stock shall be valued at $1,000 per share ("Value"), and, if converted, the Series I Class A Preferred Stock shall be converted into such number of Common Shares (the "Conversion Shares") as is obtained by dividing the aggregate Value of the shares of Series I Class A Preferred Stock being so converted, together with all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon, by the "Average Stock Price" per share of the Conversion Shares (the "Conversion Price"), subject to adjustment pursuant to the provisions of this Part 5. For purposes of this Part 5, the "Average Stock Price" means the lesser of (x) seventy percent (70%) of the average daily closing bid prices of the Common Shares for the period of five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of subscription by the Holder or (y) seventy percent (70%) of the daily average closing bid prices of Common Shares for the period of five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of the conversion of the Series I Class A Preferred Stock in respect of which such Average Stock Price is determined. The closing price for each trading day shall be determined as provided in the last sentence of Section 3.2. 
   
 5.2   Any holder of Series I Class A Preferred Stock (an "Eligible Holder") may at any time commencing forty-five (45) days after the issuance of any Series I Class A Preferred Stock convert up to one hundred percent (100%) of his holdings of Series I Class A Preferred Stock in accordance with this Part 5. 
   
 5.3  The conversion right granted by Section 5.2 hereof may be exercised only by an Eligible Holder of Series I Class A Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, by the surrender of the share certificate or share certificates representing the Series I Class A Preferred Stock to be converted at the principal office of the Corporation (or at such other place as the Corporation may designate in a written notice sent to the holder by first class mail, postage prepaid, at its address shown on the books of the Corporation) against delivery of that number of whole Common Shares as shall be computed by dividing (I) the aggregate Value of the Series I Class A Preferred Stock so surrendered for conversion plus any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon, if any, by (2) the Conversion Price in effect at the date of the conversion. At the time of conversion of a share of the Series I Class A Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay in cash to the holder thereof an amount equal to all unpaid dividends, if any, accrued thereon to the date of conversion, or at the Corporation's option, issue that number of whole Common Shares which is equal to the product of dividing the amount of such unpaid dividends by the Average Stock Price whether or not declared by the Board. Each Series I Class A Preferred Stock share certificate surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed by its holder. In the event of any exercise of the conversion right of the Series I Class A Preferred Stock granted herein (i) share certificate representing the Common Shares purchased by virtue of such exercise shall be delivered to such holder within three (3) days of notice of conversion, and (ii) unless the Series I Class A Preferred Stock has been fully converted, a new  share certificate representing the Series I Class A Preferred Stock not so converted, if any, shall also be delivered to such holder within three (3) days of notice of conversion. Any Eligible Holder may exercise its right to convert the Series I Class A Preferred Stock by telecopying an executed and completed Notice of Conversion to the Corporation, and within seventy-two (72) hours thereafter, delivering the original Notice of Conversion and the certificate representing the Series I Class A Preferred Stock to the Corporation by express courier. Each date on which a Notice of Conversion is telecopied to and received by the Corporation in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be deemed a conversion date. The Corporation will transmit the Common Shares certificates issuable upon conversion of any Series I Class A Preferred Stock (together with the certificates representing the Series I Class A Preferred Stock not so converted) to the Eligible Holder via express courier within three (3) business days after the conversion date if the Corporation has received the original Notice of Conversion and the Series I Class A Shares certificates being so converted  by such date. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 -5- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 5.4    All Common Shares which may be issued upon conversion of Series I Class A Preferred Stock will, upon issuance, be duly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens, and charges with respect to the issue thereof. At all times that any Series I Class A Preferred Stock is outstanding, the Corporation shall have authorized, and shall have reserved for the purpose of issuance upon such conversion, a sufficient number of Common Shares to provide for the conversion into Common Shares of all Series I Class A Preferred Stock then outstanding at the then effective Conversion Price. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if, at any time, the Conversion Price is decreased, the number of Common Shares authorized and reserved for issuance upon the conversion of the Series I Class A Preferred Stock shall be proportionately increased. 
   
 5.5   The number of Common Shares issued upon conversion of Series I Class A Preferred Stock and the Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time upon the happening of certain events, as follows: 
   
5.5.1 Change of Designation of the Common Shares or the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions in respect of the Common Shares or division of the Common Shares into series. In the case of any amendment to the Articles to change the designation of the Common Shares or the rights, privileges, restrictions or conditions in respect of the Common Shares or division of the Common Shares into series the rights of the holders of the Series I Class A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted so as to provide that upon conversion thereof, the holder of the Series I Class A Preferred Stock being converted shall procure, in lieu of each Common Share theretofore issuable upon such conversion, the kind and amount of shares, other securities, money and property receivable upon such designation, change or division by the holder of one Common Share issuable upon such conversion had conversion occurred immediately prior to such designation, change or division. The Series I Class A Preferred Stock shall be deemed thereafter to provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for i n this Part 5. The provisions of this subsection 5.5.1 shall apply in the same manner to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations, and mergers. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 -6- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
5.5.2 If the Corporation, at any time while any of the Series I Class A Preferred Stock is outstanding, shall amend the Articles so as to change the Common Shares into a different number of shares, the Conversion Price shall be proportionately reduced, in case of such change increasing the number of Common Shares, as of the effective date of such increase, or if the Corporation shall take a record of holders of its Common Shares for the purpose of such increase, as of such record date, whichever is earlier, or the Conversion Price shall be proportionately increased, in the case of such change decreasing the number of  Common Shares, as of the effective date of such decrease or, if the Corporation shall take a record of holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of such decrease, as of such record date, whichever is earlier. 
   
5.5 3 If the Corporation, at any time while any of the Series I Class A Preferred Stock  is outstanding, shall pay a dividend payable in Common Shares (except for any dividends of Common Shares payable pursuant to Part 3 hereof), the Conversion Price shall be adjusted, as of the date the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common Shares for the purposes of receiving such dividend (or if no such record is taken, as of the date of payment of such dividend), to that price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price therefor in effect by a fraction (1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to such dividend, and (2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such dividend (plus in the event that the Corporation paid cash for fractional shares, the number of additional shares which would have been outstanding had the Corporation issued fractional shares in connection with said dividend). 
   
 5.6    Whenever the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to Section 5.5 hereof, the Corporation shall make a certificate signed by its President, or a Vice President and by its Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer, Secretary or Assistant Secretary, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment, the amount of the adjustment, the method by which such adjustment was calculated (including a description of the basis on which the Board of Directors made any determination hereunder), and the Conversion Price after giving effect to such adjustment, and shall cause copies of such certificates to be mailed (by first class mail, postage prepaid) to each holder of the Series I Class A Preferred Stock at its address shown on the books of the Corporation. The Corporation shall make such certificate and mail it to each such holder promptly after each adjustment. 
   
 5.7    No fractional Common Shares shall be issued in connection with any conversion of Series I Class A Preferred Stock, but in lieu of such fractional shares, the Corporation shall make a cash payment therefor equal in amount to the product of the applicable fraction multiplied by the Conversion Price then in effect. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 -7- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
5.8     No Series I Class A Preferred Stock which has been converted into Common Shares shall be reissued by the Corporation;  provided ,  however, that each such share shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued Preferred Stock without designation as to series and may thereafter be issued as a series of Preferred Stock not designated as Series I Class A Preferred Stock. 
   
 Part 6 - pari ty with Oth er Shares of Class A Preferred Shares. 
   
6.1     If any cumulative dividends or accounts payable or return of capital in respect of Series I Class A Preferred Stock are not paid in full, the owners of all series of outstanding Preferred Stock shall participate rateably in respect of accumulated dividends and return of capital. 
   
 Part 7 - Amendment. 
   
7.1     In addition to any requirement for a series vote pursuant to the GCL in respect of any amendment to the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation that adversely affects the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions of the Series I Class A Preferred Stock, the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching to the Series I Class A Preferred Stock: may be amended by an amendment to the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation so as to affect such adversely only if the Corporation has obtained the affirmative vote at a duly called and held series meeting of the holders of the Series I Class A Preferred Stock or written consent by the holders of a majority of the Series I Class A Preferred Stock then outstanding. Notwithstanding the above, the number of authorized shares of such class or classes of stock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting as a single  class ,  irrespective of this Section 7.1.

For purposes of this Part 5, the "Average Stock Price" means the lesser of (x) seventy percent (70%) of the average daily closing bid prices of the Common Shares for a period of five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of subscription by the Holder or (y) seventy percent (70%) of the average daily closing bid prices of Common Shares for the period of five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the date of the conversion of the Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock in respect of which such Average Stock Price is determined. The closing price for each trading day shall be determined as provided in the last sentence of Section 3.2. 
   
 5.2       Any holder of Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock (an "Eligible Holder") may at any time commencing forty-five (45) days after the issuance of any Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock convert up to one hundred percent (100%) of his holdings of Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock in accordance with this Part 5.

 5.3       The conversion right granted by Section 5.2 hereof may be exercised only by an Eligible Holder of Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, by the surrender of the share certificate or share certificates representing the Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock to be converted at the principal office of the Corporation (or at such other place as the Corporation may designate in a written notice sent to the holder by first class mail, postage prepaid, at its address shown on the books of the Corporation) against delivery of that number of whole Common Shares as shall be computed by dividing (1) the aggregate Value of the Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock so surrendered for conversion plus any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon, if any, by (2) the Conversion Price in effect at the date of the conversion. At the time of conversion of a share of the Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay in cash to the holder thereof an amount equal to all unpaid dividends, if any, accrued thereon to the date of conversion, or, at the Corporation's option, issue that number of whole Common Shares which is equal to the product of dividing the amount of such unpaid dividends by the Average Stock Price whether or not declared by the Board. Each Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock share certificate surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed by its holder. In the event of any exercise of the conversion right of the Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock granted herein (i) share certificate representing the Common Shares purchased by virtue of such exercise shall be delivered to such holder within three (3) days of notice of conversion, and (ii) unless the Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock has been fully converted, a new share certificate representing the Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock not so converted, if any, shall also be delivered to such holder within three (3) days of notice of conversion. Any Eligible Holder may exercise its right to convert the Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock by telecopying an executed and completed Notice of Conversion to the Corporation, and within seventy-two (72) hours thereafter, delivering the original Notice of Conversion and the certificate representing the Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock to the Corporation by express courier. Each date on which a Notice of Conversion is telecopied to and received by the Corporation in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be deemed a conversion date. The Corporation will transmit the Common Shares certificates issuable upon conversion of any Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock (together with the certificates representing the Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock not so converted) to the Eligible Holder via express courier within three (3) business days after the conversion date if the Corporation has received the original Notice of Conversion and the Series   2 Class B Shares certificates being so  converted  by such date. 
   
 5.4       All Common Shares which may be issued upon conversion of Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock will, upon issuance, be duly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens, and charges with respect to the issue thereof. At all times that any Series  2 Class B Preferred Stock is outstanding, the Corporation shall have authorized, and shall have reserved for the purpose of issuance upon such conversion, a sufficient number of Common Shares to provide for the conversion into Common Shares of all Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock then outstanding at the then effective Conversion Price. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if, at any time, the Conversion Price is decreased, the number of Common Shares authorized and reserved for issuance upon the conversion of the Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock shall be proportionately increased.

The  Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock shall be deemed thereafter to provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Part 5. The provisions of this subsection 5.5.1 shall apply in the same manner to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations, and mergers. 
   
 5.5.2    If the Corporation, at any time while any of the Series   2 Class  B Preferred Stock is outstanding, shall amend the Articles so as to change the Common Shares into a different number of shares, the Conversion Price shall be proportionately reduced, in ease of such change increasing the number of Common Shares, as of the effective date of such increase, or if the Corporation shall take a record of holders of its Common Shares for the purpose of such increase, as of such record date, whichever is earlier, or the Conversion Price shall be proportionately increased, in the case of such change decreasing the  number of Common Shares, as of the effective date of such decrease or, if the Corporation shall take a record of holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of such decrease, as of such record date, whichever is earlier. 
   
5.5.3    If the Corporation, at any time while any of the Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock is outstanding, shall pay a dividend payable in Common Shares (except for any dividends of Common Shares payable pursuant to Part 3 hereof), the Conversion Price shall be adjusted, as of the date the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its Common Shares for the purposes of receiving such dividend (or if no such record is taken, as of the date of payment of such dividend), to that price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price therefor in effect by a fraction (1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to such dividend, and (2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such dividend (plus in the event that the Corporation paid cash for fractional shares, the number of additional shares which would have been outstanding had the Corporation issued fractional shares in connection with said dividend).

 5.6         Whenever the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to Section 5.5 hereof, the Corporation shall make a certificate signed by its President, or a Vice President and by its Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer, Secretary or Assistant Secretary, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment, the amount of the adjustment, the method by which such adjustment was calculated (including a description of the basis on which the Board of Directors made any determination hereunder), and the Conversion Price after giving effect to such adjustment, and shall cause copies of such certificates to be mailed (by first class mail, postage prepaid) to each holder of the Series  2 Class B Preferred Stock at its address shown on the books of the Corporation. The Corporation shall make such certificate and mail it to each such holder promptly after each adjustment. 
   
5.7       No fractional Common Shares shall be issued in connection with any conversion of Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock, but in lieu of such fractional shares, the Corporation shall make a cash payment therefor equal in amount to the product of the applicable fraction multiplied by the Conversion Price then in effect. 
   
5.8       No Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock which has been converted into Common Shares shall be reissued by the Corporation;  provided ,  however, that each such share shall be restored to the status of authorized but unissued Preferred Stock without designation as to series and may thereafter be issued as a series of Preferred Stock not designated as Series 2 Class B Preferred Stock.

 6.2         For purposes of this resolution, any stock of any class or series of   the  Corporation  shall  be deemed to rank:

 4.1.1     Up to one thousand eight hundred thirty-three (1,833) shares of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock may be converted at the Conversion Price (as that term is defined in Section 4.2 below) at any time on or after October 1,   1996; 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 -3- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 4.1.2    Up to one thousand eight hundred thirty-three (1,833) shares of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock may be converted at the Conversion Price at any time on or after November 1, 1996; and, 
   
 4.1.3    Up to one thousand eight hundred thirty-four (1,854) shares of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock may be converted at the Conversion Price on or after December 1, 1996. 
   
 4.2            Conversion Price .   As used herein, the term Conversion Price shall be the product of   (i)  the average closing bid quotation of the Common Stock as reported on the over-the-counter market, or the closing sale price if listed on a national securities exchange, for the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the date of the Conversion Notice referred to in Section 4.3 below multiplied by (ii) seventy-five percent (75%). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price shall not be (i) less than a minimum of $.75 per share ("Minimum Conversion Price") or (ii) more than a maximum of $1.50 per share ("Maximum Conversion Price"). If, after July 1, 1996, the Corporation sustains a net loss, on a consolidated basis, in each of two   (2)  consecutive quarters, as determined under generally accepted accounting principles, the Minimum Conversion Price shall be reduced $.25 a share, but there shall be no change to, or reduction of, the Maximum Convention Price. For the purpose of determining whether the Corporation has had a net loss in each of two (2) consecutive quarters, at no time shall a quarter that has already been considered in such determination be considered in any subsequent determination (as an example the third quarter of 1996 in which there is a net profit and the fourth quarter of 1996 in which there is a net loss shall be considered as two consecutive quarters, and, as a result, the fourth quarter of 1996 shall not be considered along with the first quarter of 1997 as two (2) consecutive quarters, but the first quarter of 1997 must be considered with the second quarter of 1997 for the purposes of such determination). For the purposes of this Section 4.2, a "quarter" is a three (3) month period ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. If any of the outstanding shares of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock are converted, in whole or in part, into Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Part 4, the number of shares of whole Common Stock to be issued to the holder as a result of such conversion shall be determined by dividing (a) the aggregate Liquidation Value of the Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock so surrendered for conversion by (b) the Conversion Price in effect at the date of the conversion. At the time of conversion of shares of the Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay in cash to the holder thereof an amount equal to all unpaid and accrued dividends, if any, accrued thereon to the date of conversion, or, at the Corporation's option, in lieu of paying cash for the accrued and unpaid dividends, issue that number of shares of whole Common Stock which is equal to the product of dividing the amount of such unpaid and accrued dividends to the date of conversion on the shares of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock so converted by the Conversion Price in effect at the date of conversion. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 -4- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4.3            Mechanics of Conversion . Any holder of the Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock who wishes to exercise its Conversion Rights pursuant to Section 4.1 of this Part 4 must, if such shares are not being held in escrow by the Corporation's attorneys, surrender the certificate therefor at the principal executive office of the Corporation, and give written notice, which may be via facsimile transmission, to the Corporation at such office that it elects to convert the same (the "Conversion Notice"). In the event that the shares of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock are being held in escrow by the Corporation's attorneys, no delivery of the certificates shall be required. No Conversion Notice with respect to any shares of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock can be given prior to the time such shares of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock are eligible for conversion in accordance with the provision of Section 4.1 above. Any such premature Conversion Notice shall automatically be null and void. The Corporation shall, within five (5) business days after receipt of an appropriate and timely Conversion Notice (and certificate, if necessary), issue to such holder of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock or its agent a certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he shall be entitled; it being expressly agreed that until and unless the holder delivers written notice to the Corporation to the contrary, all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock hereunder are to be delivered by the Corporation to a party designated in writing by the holder in the Conversion Notice for the account of the holder and such shall be deemed valid delivery to the holder of such shares of Common Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made only after both the certificate for the shares of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock to be converted have been surrendered and the Conversion Notice is received by the Corporation (or in the event that no surrender of the Certificate is required, then only upon the receipt by the Corporation of the Conversion Note) (the "Conversion Documents"), and the person or entity whose name is noted on the certificate evidencing such shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock at and after such time. In the event that the Conversion Notice is sent via facsimile transmission, the Corporation shall be deemed to have received such Conversion Notice on the first business day on which such facsimile Conversion Notice is actually received. If the Corporation fails to deliver to the holder or its agent the certificate representing the shares of Common Stock that the holder is entitled to receive as a result of such conversion within five (5) business days after receipt by the Corporation from the holder of an appropriate and timely Conversion Notice and certificates pursuant to the terms of this Section 4.3, the Corporation shall pay to the holder U.S. $1.000 for each day that the Corporation is late in delivering such certificate to the holder or its agent. 
   
 4.4            Adjustments to   Conversion Price for Stock Dividends and for Combinations or   Subdivisions of Common Stock. If the Corporation at any time or from time to time while shares of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding shall declare or pay, without consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock, or shall effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock (by stock split, reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock or in any right to acquire Common Stock), or if the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Price in effect immediately before such event shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such event, be proportionately decreased or increased, as appropriate. If the Corporation shall declare or pay, without consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock payable in any right to acquire Common stock for no consideration, then the Corporation shall be deemed to have made a dividend payable in Common Stock in an amount of shares equal to the maximum number of shares issuable upon exercise of such rights to acquire Common Stock. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 -5- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 4.5.           Adjustments for Reclassification and Reorganization. If the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for in Section 4.4 hereof), the Conversion Price then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted so that the Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion of the Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock immediately before that change. 
   
 4.6            Common Stock Duly Issued. All Common Stock which may be issued upon conversion of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock will, upon issuance, be duly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens, and charges with respect to the issue thereof. 
   
 4.7            Notice of Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of any Conversion Price pursuant to this Part 4, the Corporation, at its expense, within a reasonable period of time, shall compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock a notice setting forth such adjustment or readju stment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based. 
   
 4.8            Issue Taxes . The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other taxes that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion of the Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock pursuant thereto;  provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to pay any transfer taxes resulting from any transfer requested by any holder of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock in connection with such conversion. 
   
 4.9            Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall, from time to time, be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series 3 Class C Preferred stock, and, if at any time, the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in reasonable efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 -6- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 4.10          Fractional Shares .  No fractional share shall be issued upon the conversion of any share or shares of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock (including fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share. If after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the Issuance of a fractional share of Common Stock, such fractional share shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share, 
   
 4.11          Notice. Any notices required by the provisions of this Part 4 to be given to the holders of shares of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at his address appearing on the books of the Corporation. 
   
 4.12          Business Day. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a day when the federal and state banks located in the State of New York are required or permitted to close. 
   
 Part 5 -   Redemption . 
   
 5.1            Redemption During First 180 Days . At any time, and from time to time, during the first one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of issuance of the Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock, the Corporation may, at its sole option, but shall not be obligated to, redeem, in whole or in part, the then outstanding Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock at a price per share of U. S. $1,300.00 each ("First Six Months Redemption Price"). The Company may exercise such redemption by giving the holder of the Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock written notice of such redemption at any time during such 180-day period. 
   
 5.2            Other Rights of Redemption by the Corporation. At any time, and from time to time, after one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the issuance of any Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock, if the average of the closing bid price of the Common Stock for ten (10) consecutive days shall be in excess of $2.50 per share, the Corporation may, at its sole option, but shall not be obligated to, redeem, in whole or in part, the then outstanding Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock at a price per share of U. S. $1,000 each (the "Redemption Price") (such price to be adjusted proportionately in the event of any change of the Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock into a different number of shares of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock). 
   
 5.3            Mechanics of Redemption. Thirty (30) days prior to any date stipulated by the Corporation for the redemption of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock (the "Redemption Date"), written notice (the "Redemption Notice") shall be mailed to each holder of record on such notice date of the Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock. The Redemption Notice shall state; (i) the Redemption Date of such shares, (ii) the number of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock to be redeemed from the holder to whom the Redemption Notice is addressed, (iii) instructions for surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, of a share certificate or share certificates representing the number of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock to be redeemed from such holder, and (iv) instructions as to how to specify to the Corporation the number of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock to be redeemed as provided in this Part 5 and, if the Redemption Notice is mailed to the Holder after the first one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of issuance of the Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock, the number of shares to be converted into Co mmon Stock as provided in Part 4 hereof.

If the redemption occurs pursuant to Section 5.2 hereof, then, upon receipt of the Redemption Notice, any holder of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock shall have the option, at its sole election, to specify what portion of its Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock called for redemption in the Redemption Notice shall be redeemed as provided in this Part 5 or converted into Common Stock in the manner provided in Part 4 hereof, except that, notwithstanding any provision of such Part 4 to the contrary, such holder shall have the right to convert into Common Stock that number of Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock called for redemption in the Redemption Notice. 
   
 5.5            Surrender of Certificates. On or before the Redemption Date in respect of any Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock, each holder of such shares shall surrender the required certificate or certificates representing such shares to the Corporation in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and upon the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price for such shares shall be made payable, in the manner provided in Section 5.5 hereof, to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof, and each surrendered share certificate shall be canceled and retired.

On the Redemption Date in respect of any Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock or prior thereto, the Corporation shall deposit with any bank or trust company having a capital and surplus of at least U.S. $50,000,000, as a trust fund, a sum equal to the aggregate First Six Months Redemption Price or the Redemption Price, whichever is applicable, of all such shares called from redemption (less the aggregate Redemption Price for those Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock in respect of which the Corporation has received notice from the holder thereof of its election to convert Series 3 Class C Preferred Stock into Common Stock), with irrevocable instructions and authority to the bank or trust company to pay, on or after the Redemption Date, the First Six Months Redemption Price or the Redemption Price, whichever is applicable, to the respective holders upon the surrender of their share certificates. The deposit shall constitute full payment for the shares to their holders, and from and after the date of the deposit the redeemed shares shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding, and holders thereof shall cease to be shareholders with respect to such shares and shall have no rights with respect thereto except the rights to receive from the bank or trust company payments of the First Six Months Redemption Price or the Redemption Price, whichever is applicable, of the shares, without interest, upon surrender of their certificates thereof. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of one year following the Redemption Date shall be released or repaid to the Corporation, after which the former holders of shares called for redemption shall be entitled to receive payment of the First Six Months Redemption Price or the Redemption Price, whichever is applicable, in respect of their shares only from the Corporation.

The Liquidation Value of the Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock shall be $1.000 per outstanding share of the Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock (the "Liquidation Value"). The dividend is payable semi-annually within seven (7) business days after each of December 31 and June 30 of each year, commencing December 31, 1997 (each, a "Dividend Declaration Date").

 4.1.1     Up to one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) shares of Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock may be converted at the Conversion Price (as that term is defined in Section 4.2 below) at any time on or after October 5, 1997; and, 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 -4- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 4.1.2     Up to an additional one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) shares of Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock may be converted at the Conversion Price at any time on or after November 5, 1997. 
   
 4.2     Conversion Price. Subject to the terms hereof, as used herein, the term Conversion Price per outstanding share of Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock shall be the product of the lesser of (i) the average closing bid quotation of the Common Stock as reported on the over-the-counter market, or the closing sale price if listed on a national securities exchange, for the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the date of the Conversion Notice referred to in Section 4.3 below multiplied by eighty percent (80%) or (ii) U.S. $1.6875. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price shall not be less than a minimum of $.75 per share ("Minimum Conversion Price"), which Minimum Conversion Price shall be eliminated from and after September 6, 1998. If any of the outstanding shares of Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock are converted, in whole or in part, into Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Part 4, the number of shares of whole Common Stock to be issued to the holder as a result of such conversion shall be determined by dividing (a) the aggregate Liquidation Value of the Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock so surrendered for conversion by (b) the Conversion Price in effect at the date of the conversion. At the time of conversion of shares of the Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay in cash to the holder thereof an amount equal to all unpaid and accrued dividends, if any, accrued thereon to the date of conversion, or, at the Corporation's option, in lieu of paying cash for the accrued and unpaid dividends, issue that number of shares of whole Common Stock which is equal to the quotient of the amount of such unpaid and accrued dividends to the date of conversion on the shares of Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock so converted divided by the Stock Dividend Price, as defined in Section 3.1 hereof, in effect at the date of conversion.

 4.3     Mechanics of Conversion . Any holder of the Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock who wishes to exercise its Conversion Rights pursuant to Section 4.1 of this Part 4 must, if such shares are not being held in escrow by the Corporation's attorneys, surrender the certificate therefor at the principal executive office of the Corporation, and give written notice, which may be via facsimile transmission, to the Corporation at such office that it elects to convert the same (the "Conversion Notice"). In the event that the shares of Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock are being held in escrow by the Corporation's attorneys, no delivery of the certificates shall be required. No Conversion Notice with respect to any shares of Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock can be given prior to the time such shares of Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock are eligible for conversion in accordance with the provision of Section 4.1 above, except as provided in Section 4.4. Any such premature Conversion Notice shall automatically be null and void. The Corporation shall, within five (5) business days after receipt of an appropriate and timely Conversion Notice (and certificate, if necessary), issue to such holder of Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock or its agent a certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he shall be entitled; it being expressly agreed that, until and unless the holder delivers written notice  to the Corporation to the contrary, all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock hereunder are to be delivered by the Corporation to a party designated in writing by the holder in the Conversion Notice for the account of the holder and such shall be deemed valid delivery to the holder of such shares of Common Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made only after both the certificate for the shares of Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock to be converted have been surrendered and the Conversion Notice is received by the Corporation (or in the event that no surrender of the Certificate is required, then only upon the receipt by the Corporation of Use Conversion Notice) (the "Conversion Documents"), and the person or entity whose name is noted on the certificate evidencing such shares or Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock at and after such time. In the event that the Conversion Notice is sent via facsimile transmission, the Corporation shall be deemed to have received such Conversion Notice on the first business day on which such facsimile Conversion Notice is actually received. If the Corporation fails to deliver to the holder or its agent the certificate representing the shares of Common Stock that the holder is entitled to receive as a result of such conversion within seven (7) business days after receipt by the Corporation from the holder of an appropriate and timely Conversion Notice and certificates pursuant to the terms of this Section 4.3 ("Seven (7) Business Day Period"), then, upon the written demand of RBB Bank Aktiengesellschaft ("RBB Bank"), the holder of the Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock, for payment of the penalty described below in this Section 4.3, which demand must be received by the Corporation no later than ten (10) calendar days after the expiration of such Seven (7) Business Day Period, the Corporation shall pay to RBB Bank the following penalty for each business day after the Seven (7) Business Day Period until the Corporation delivers to the holder or its agent the certificate representing the shares of Common Stock that the holder is entitled to receive as a result of such conversion: business day eight (8) - U.S. $1,000: business day nine (9) - U.S. $2,000, and each business day thereafter an amount equal to the penalty due on the immediately preceding business day times two (2) until the Corporation delivers to the holder or its agent the certificate representing the shares of Common Stock that the holder is entitled to receive as a result  of such conversion. 
 
   
 4.4     Merger or Consolidation . In case of either (a) any merger or consolidation to which the Corporation is a party (collectively, the "Merger"), other than a Merger in which the Corporation is the surviving or continuing corporation, or (b) any sale or conveyance to another corporation of all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Corporation (collectively. the "Sale"), and such Merger or Sale becomes effective (x) while any shares of Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock are outstanding and prior to the date that the Corporation's Registration Statement covering up to 1,482,000 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock is declared effective by the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission or (y) prior to the end of the restriction periods in Section 4.1, then, in such event, the Corporation or such successor corporation, as the cast may be, shall make appropriate provision so that the holder of each share of Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have the right to convert such share of Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities and property receivable upon such Merger or Sale by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock could have been convened into immediately prior to such Merger or Sale, subject to adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Part 4.

 4.4    Adjustments to Conversion Price for Stock Dividends and for Combinations or Subdivisions of Common Stock. If the Corporation at any time or from time to time while shares of Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding shall declare or pay, without consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock, or shall effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock (by stock split, reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock or in any right to acquire Common Stock), or if the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Price in effect immediately before such event shall, concurrently with the effectiveness o f such event, be proportionately decreased or increased, as appropriate. 
   
 4.5     Adjustments for Reclassification and Reorganization. If the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for in Section 4.4 hereof), the Conversion Price then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted so that the Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders of Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion of the Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock immediately before that change. 
   
 4.6     Common Stock Duly Issued. All Common Stock which may be issued upon conversion of Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock will, upon issuance, be duly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens, and charges with respect to the issue thereof. 
   
 4.7     Notice of Adjustments . Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of any  Conversion Price pursuant to this Part 4, the Corporation, at its expense, within a reasonable period of time, shall compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock a notice setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustmen t is based.

 4.10     Fractional Shares. No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any share or shares of Series 4 Class D Preferred Stock.

If any of the outstanding shares of Series 5 Class E Preferred Stock are converted, in whole or in part, into Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Part 4, the number of shares of whole Common Stock to be issued to the holder as a result of such conversion shall be determined by dividing (a) the aggregate Liquidation Value of the Series 5 Class E Preferred Stock so surrendered for conversion by (b) the Conversion Price in effect at the date of the conversion. At the time of conversion of shares of the Series 5 Class E Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay in cash to the holder thereof an amount equal to all unpaid and accrued dividends, if any, accrued thereon to the date of conversion, or, at the Corporation's option, in lieu of paying cash for the accrued and unpaid dividends, issue that number of shares of whole Common Stock which is equal to the quotient of the amount of such unpaid and accrued dividends to the date of conversion on the shares of Series 5 Class E Preferred Stock so converted divided by the Stock Dividend Price, as defined in Section 3.1 hereof, in effect at the date of conversion.

Times (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed during the period for which the dividend is to be paid, and the denominator of which is 365.

 Part 4-Conversion . The holders of the Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock shall have rights to convert the shares of Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock into shares of the Corporation's Common Stock, par value $.001 per share ("Common Stock"), as follows (the "Conversion Rights"):

 4.1.2       Up to  an additional one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) shares of Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock may be converted at the Conversion Price at any lime on or after November 5, 1997. 
   
 4.2             Conversion Price . Subject to the terms hereof, as used herein, the Conversion Price per outstanding share of Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock shall be $1,8125, except that, in the event the average closing bid price per share of the Common Stock for 20 of any 30 consecutive trading days after March 1, 1998 shall be less than $2.50 as reported on the over-the-counter market, or the closing sale price if listed on a national securities exchange, the Conversion Price shall thereafter be the product of the lesser of (i) the average closing bid quotation of the Common Stock as reported on the over-the-counter market or the closing sale price if listed on a national securities exchange, for the five trading days immediately preceding the date of the Conversion Notice referred to in Section 4.3 below multiplied by eighty percent (80%) or (ii) $1.8125. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price shall not be less than a minimum of $.75 per share ("Minimum Conversion Price"), which Minimum Conversion Price shall be eliminated from and after September 6, 1998. If any of the outstanding shares of Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock are converted, in whole or in part, into Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Part 4 the number of shares of whole Common Stock to be issued to the holder as a result of such conversion shall be determined by dividing (a) the aggregate Liquidation Value of the Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock so surrendered for conversion by (b) the Conversion Price as of such conversion. At the time of conversion of shares of the Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay in cash to the holder thereof an amount equal to all unpaid and accrued dividends, if any, accrued thereon to the date of conversion, or, at the Corporation's option, in lieu of paying cash for the accrued and unpaid dividends, issue that number of whole shares of Common Stock which is equal to the quotient of the amount of such unpaid and accrued dividends to the date of conversion on the shares of Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock so converted divided by the Stock Dividend Price as defined in Part 3 hereof, in effect at the date of conversion.

 4.3             Mechanics o f Conversion . Any holder of the Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock who wishes to exercise its Conversion Rights pursuant to Section 4.1 of this Part 4 must, if such shares are not being held in escrow by the Corporation's attorneys, surrender the certificate therefor at the principal executive office of the Corporation, and give written notice, which may be via facsimile transmission, to the Corporation at such office that it elects to convert the same (the "Conversion Notice"). In the event that the shares of Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock are being  held in escrow by the Corporation's attorneys, no delivery of the certificates shall be required. No Conversion Notice with respect to any shares of Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock can be given prior to the time such shares of Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock are eligible for conversion in accordance with the provision of Section 4.1 above, except as provided in Section 4.4.  Any such premature Conversion Notice shall automatically be null and void.  The Corporation shall, within five (5) business days after receipt of an appropriate and timely Conversion Notice (and certificate, if necessary), issue to such holder of Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock or its agent a certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he shall be entitled; it being expressly agreed that until and unless the holder delivers written notice to the Corporation to the contrary, all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock hereunder are to be delivered by the Corporation to a party designated in writing by the holder in the Conversion Notice for the account of the holder and such shall be deemed valid delivery to the holder of such shares of Common Stock.  Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made only after both the certificate for the shares of Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock to be converted have been surrendered and the Conversion Notice is received by the Corporation (or in the event that no surrender of the Certificate is required, then only upon the receipt by the Corporation of the Conversion Notice) (the "Conversion Documents"), and the person or entity whose name is noted on the certificate evidencing such shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for ail purposes as the record holder or such shares of Common Stock at and after such time. In the event that the Conversion Notice is sent via facsimile transmission, the Corporation shall be deemed to have received such Conversion Notice on the first business day on which such facsimile Conversion Notice is actually received. If the Corporation fails to deliver to the holder or its agent the certificate representing the shares of Common Stock that the holder is entitled to receive as a result of such conversion within seven (7) business days after receipt by the Corporation from the holder of an appropriate and timely Conversion Notice and certificates pursuant to the terms of this Section 4.3 ("Seven (7) Business Day Period"), then, upon the written demand of RBB Bank Aktiengesellschaft ("RBB Bank"), the holder of the Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock, for payment of the penalty described below in this Section 4.3, which demand must be received by the Corporation no later than ten (10) calendar days after the expiration of such Seven (7) Business Day Period, the Corporation shall pay to RBB Bank the following penalty for each business day after the Seven (7) Business Day Period until the Corporation delivers to the holder or its agent the certificate representing the shares of Common Stock that the holder is entitled to receive as a result of such conversion: business day eight (8) - U.S. $1,000; business day nine (9) - U.S. $2,000, and each business day thereafter an amount equal to the penalty due on the immediately preceding business day times two (2) until the Corporation delivers to the holder or its agent the certificate representing the shares of Common Stock that the holder is entitled to receive as a result of such conversion.

S. Securities and Exchange Commission or (y) prior to the end of the restriction periods in Section 4.1, then, in such event, the Corporation or such successor corporation, as the case may be, shall make appropriate provision so that the holder of each share of Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have the right to convert such share of Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities and property receivable upon such Merger or Sale by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock could have been converted into immediately prior to such Merger or Sale, subject to adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Part 4. 
   
 4.5             Adjustments to Conversion Price for Stock Dividends and for   Combinations or Subdivisions of Common Stock . If the Corporation at any time or from time to time while shares of Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding shall declare or pay, without consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock, or shall effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock (by stock split, reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend In Common Stock or in any right to acquire Common Stock), or if the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Price in effect immediately before such event shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of  such event, be proportionately decreased or increased, as appropriate. 
   
 4.6             Adjustments for Reclassification and Reorganization . If the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for in Section 4.4 hereof), the Conversion Price shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted so that the Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders of Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion of the Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock immediately before that change.

Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of any Conversion Price pursuant to this Part 4, the Corporation, at its expense, within a reasonable period of time, shall compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock a notice setting forth such adjustment or readjus tment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based.

 4.11           Fractional Shares . No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any share or shares of Series 6 Class F Preferred Stock.

If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of a fractional share of Common Stock, such fractional share shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share.

Subject to the terms hereof, as used herein, the term Conversion Price per outstanding share of Preferred Stock shall be One Dollar and 875/100 ($1 .875): except that after the expiration of one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Closing Date if the average of the closing bid price per share of Common Stock quoted on the NASDAQ (or the closing bid price of the Common Stock as quoted on the national securities exchange if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NASDAQ but is listed for trading on a national securities exchange) for the five (5) trading days immediately prior to the particular date of each Conversion Notice (as defined below) is less than Two Dollars and 34/100 ($2.34), then the Conversion Price for that particular conversion shall be eighty percent (80%) of the average of the closing bid price of the Common Stock on the NASDAQ (or if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NASDAQ but is listed for trading on a national securities exchange then eighty percent (80%) of the average of the closing bid price of the Common Stock on the national securities exchange) for the five (5) trading days immediately prior to the particular date of the Conversion Notice.

Such conversion shall be deemed to have been effected as of the close of business on the date on which the telecopy or facsimile Conversion Notice shall have been received by the Corporation, and the rights of the Holder of such share or shares of Preferred Stock shall cease, at such time, and the Holder or Holders shall be deemed to have become the Holder or Holders of record of the shares of Common Stock represented thereby.

If Shareholder Approval is required as set forth in the above paragraph, the Corporation shall take all necessary steps to obtain such Shareholder Approval upon receipt of  the Conversion Notice triggering the need for Shareholder Approval ("Current Conversion Notice").

In the event that the Corporation elects to pay the accrued dividends due as of a Dividend Declaration Date on an outstanding share of the Series 9 Class I Preferred Stock in Common Stock of the Corporation, the holder of such share shall receive that number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation equal to the product of (a) the quotient of (i) the Dividend Rate divided by (ii) the average of the closing bid quotation of the Corporation's Common Stock as reported on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system ("NASDAQ"), or the average closing sale price if listed on a national securities exchange, for the five (5) trading days immediately prior to the Dividend Declarati on Date  (the "Stock Dividend Price"), times (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed during the period for which the dividend is to be paid and the denominator of which is 365. Dividends on the Series 9 Class I Preferred Stock shall be cumulative, and no dividends or other distributions shall be paid or declared or set aside for payment  on the Corporation's Common Stock until all accrued and unpaid dividends on all outstanding shares of Series 9 Class I Preferred Stock shall have been paid or declared and set aside for payment. 
 
   
 Part 4 -   Conversion . The holders of the Series 9 Class I Preferred Stock shall have rights to convert the shares of Series 9 Class I Preferred Stock into shares of the Corporation's Common Stock, as follows (the "Conversion Rights"): 
   
 
 4.1        Right to Convert . The Series 9 Class I Preferred Stock shall be convertible into shares of   Common Stock at any time. 
   
 
 4.2        Conversion Price. Subject to the terms hereof, as used herein, the Conversion Price per outstanding share of Series 9 Class I Preferred Stock shall be $1.8125, except that, in the event the average closing bid price per share of the Common Stock as reported on the over-the-counter market, or the closing sale price if listed on a national securities exchange, for the five (5) trading days prior to the particular date of conversion shall be less than $2.265, the Conversion Price for only such particular conversion shall be the product of the average closing bid quotation of the Common Stock as reported on the over-the-counter market, or the closing sale price  if listed on a national securities exchange, for the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the date of the Conversion Notice   referred  to in Section 4.3 below in connection with such conversion multiplied by eighty percent  (80%), Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price shall  not be less than a minimum of $.75 per share ("Minimum Conversion Price"), which Minimum Conversion Price shall be eliminated from and after September 6, 1998. If any of the outstanding shares of Series 9 Class I Preferred Stock we converted, in whole or in part, into Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Part 4, the number of shares of whole Common Stock to be issued to the holder as a result of such conversion shall be determined by dividing (a) the aggregate Liquidation Value of the Series 9 Class I Preferred Stock so surrendered for conversion by (b) the Conversion Price as of such conversion.  At the time of conversion of shares of the Series 9 Class I Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay in cash to the holder thereof an amount equal to all unpaid and accrued dividends, if any, accrued thereon to the date of conversion, or, at  the Corporation's option, in lieu of paying cash for the accrued and unpaid dividends, issue that number of whole shares of Common Stock which   is equal to the quotient of the amount of such unpaid and accrued dividends to the date of conversion on the shares of Series 9 Class I Preferred Stock so converted divided by the Stock Dividend Price, as defined in Part 3 hereof, in effect at the date of conversion.

Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made only after both the certificate for the shares of Series 9 Class I Preferred Stock to be converted have been surrendered and the Conversion Notice is received by the Corporation (the "Conversion Documents"), and the person or entity whose name is noted on the certificate evidencing such shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock at and after such time. In the event that the Conversion Notice is sent via facsimile transmission, the Corporation shall be deemed to have received such Conversion Notice on the first business day on which such facsimile Conversion Notice is actually  received.

S. Securities and Exchange Commission or (y) prior to the end of the restriction periods in Section 4.1, then, in such event, the Corporation or such successor corporation, as the case may be, shall make appropriate provision so that the holder of each share of Series 9 Class I Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have the right to convert such share of Series 9 Class I Preferred Stock into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities and property receivable upon such Merger or Sale by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series 9 Class I Preferred Stock could have been converted into immediately prior to such Merger or Sale, subject to adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided  for  in this Part 4.

If, after July 1, 1996, the Corporation sustains a net loss, on a consolidated basis, in each of two (2) consecutive quarters, as determined under generally accepted accounting principles, the Minimum Conversion Price shall be reduced $.25 a share, but there shall be no change to, or reduction of, the Maximum Conversion Price. For the purpose of determining whether the Corporation has had a net loss in each of two (2) consecutive quarters, at no time shall a quarter that has already been considered in such determination be considered in any subsequent determination (as an example the third quarter of 1996 in which there is a net profit and the fourth quarter of 1996 in which there is a net loss shall be considered as two consecutive quarters, and, as a result, the fourth quarter of 1996 shall not be considered along with the first quarter of 1997 as two (2) consecutive quarters, but the first quarter of 1997 must be considered with the second quarter of 1997 for the purposes of such determination). For the purposes of this Section 4.2, a "quarter" is a three (3) month period ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. If any of the outstanding shares of Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock are converted, in whole or in part, into Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Part 4, the number of shares of whole Common Stock to be issued to the holder as a result of such conversion shall be determined by dividing (a) the aggregate Liquidation Value of the Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock so surrendered for conversion by (b) the Conversion Price in effect at the date of the conversion. At the time of conversion of shares of the Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay in cash to the holder thereof an amount equal to all unpaid and accrued dividends, if any, accrued thereon to the date of conversion, or, at the Corporation's option, in lieu of paying cash for the accrued and unpaid dividends, issue that number of shares of whole Common Stock which is equal to the product of dividing the amount of such unpaid and accrued dividends to the date of conversion on the shares of Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock so converted by the Conversion Price in effect at the date of conversion.

 4.4            Mechanics of Conversion . Any holder of the Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock who wishes to exercise its Conversion Rights pursuant to Section 4.1 of this Part 4 must, if such shares are not being held in escrow by the Corporation's attorneys, surrender the certificate therefor at the principal executive office of the Corporation, and give written notice, which may be via facsimile transmission, to the  Corporation at such office that it elects to convert the same (the "Conversion Notice"). In the event that the shares of Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock are being held in escrow by the Corporation's attorneys, no delivery of the certificates shall be required. No Conversion Notice with respect to any shares of Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock can be given prior to the time such shares of Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock are eligible for conversion in accordance with the provision of Section 4.1 above. Any such premature Conversion Notice shall automatically be null and void. The Corporation shall, within five (5) business days after receipt of an appropriate and timely Conversion Notice (and certificate, if necessary), issue to such holder of Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock or its agent a certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he shall be entitled; it being expressly agreed that until and unless the holder delivers written notice to the Corporation to the contrary, all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock hereunder are to be delivered by the Corporation to a party designated in writing by the holder in the Conversion Notice for the account of the holder and such shall be deemed valid delivery to the holder of such shares of Common Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made only after both the certificate for the shares of Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock to be converted have been surrendered and the Conversion Notice is received by the Corporation (or in the event that no surrender of the Certificate is required, then only upon the receipt by the Corporation of the Conversion Notice) (the "Conversion Documents"), and the person or entity whose name is noted on the certificate evidencing such shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock at and after such time. In the event that the Conversion Notice is sent via facsimile transmission, the Corporation shall be deemed to have received such Conversion Notice on the first business day on which such facsimile Conversion Notice is actually received. If the Corporation fails to deliver to the holder or its agent the certificate representing the shares of Common Stock that the holder is entitled to receive as a result of such conversion within five (5) business days after receipt by the Corporation from the holder of an appropriate and timely Conversion Notice and certificates pursuant to the terms of this Section 4.3, the Corporation shall pay to the holder U.S. $1,000 for each day that the Corporation is late in delivering such certificate to the h older or its agent. 
   
 4.5           Adjustments to Conversion Price for Stock Dividends and for Combinations or Subdivisions of Common Stock . If the Corporation at any time or from time to time while shares of Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding shall declare or pay, without consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock, or shall effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock (by stock split, reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock or in any right to acquire Common Stock), or if the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Price in effect immediately before such event shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such event, be proportionately decreased or increased, as appropriate. If the Corporation shall declare or pay, without consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock payable in any right to acquire Common stock for no consideration, then the Corporation shall be deemed to have made a dividend payable in Common Stock in an amount of shares equal to the maximum number of shares issuable upon exercise of such rights to acquire Common Stock.

 4.6.            Adjustments for Reclassification and Reorganization . If the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for in Section 4.4 hereof), the Conversion Price then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted so that the Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders of Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion of the Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock immediately before that change. 
   
 4.7            Common Stock Duly Issued . All Common Stock which may be issued upon conversion of Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock will, upon issuance, be duly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens, and charges with respect to the issue thereof. 
   
 4.8            Notice of Adjustments . Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of any Conversion Price pursuant to this Part 4, the Corporation, at its expense, within a reasonable period of time, shall compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock a notice setting forth such adjustment or readju stment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based. 
   
 4.9            Issue Taxes . The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other taxes that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion of the Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock pursuant thereto;  provided ,  however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to pay any transfer taxes resulting from any transfer requested by any holder of Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock in connection with such conversion. 
   
 4.10          Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion . The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall, from time to time, be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series 11 Class K Preferred stock, and, if at any time, the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in reasonable efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation.

 4.11          Fractional Shares . No fractional share shall be issued upon the conversion of any share or shares of Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock (including fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of a fractional share of Common Stock, such fractional share shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share. 
   
 4.12          Notices . Any notices required by the provisions of this Part 4 to be given to the holders of shares of Series 11 Class K Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at his address appearing on the books of the Corporation. 
   
 4.13          Business Day . As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a day when the federal and state banks located in the State of New York are required or permitted to close.

 5.4            Rights of Conversion Upon Redemption .

Dividends shall accrue from the first day of the semi-annual period in which such dividend may be payable, except with respect to the first semi-annual dividend which shall accrue from March 1, 1998. In the event that the Corporation elects to pay the accrued dividends due as of a Dividend Declaration Date on an outstanding share of the Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock in Common Stock of the Corporation, the holder of such share shall receive that number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation equal to the product of (a) the quotient of (i) the Dividend Rate divided by (ii) the average of the closing bid quotation of the Corporation's Common Stock as reported on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system ("NASDAQ"), or the average closing sale price if listed on a national securities exchange, for the five (5) trading days immediately prior to the Dividend Declaration Date (the "Stock Dividend Price"), times (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed during the period for which the dividend is to be paid and the denominator of which is 365.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price shall not be less than a minimum of $1.50 per share ("Minimum Conversion Price") for a period of twenty-four (24) months from the date of issuance of the Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock. If any of the outstanding shares of Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock are converted, in whole or in part, into Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Part 4, the number of shares of whole Common Stock to be issued to the holder as a result of such conversion shall be determined by dividing (a) the aggregate Liquidation Value of the Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock so surrendered for conversion by (b) the Conversion Price as of such conversion. At the time of conversion of shares of the Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay in cash to the holder thereof an amount equal to all unpaid and accrued dividends, if any, accrued thereon to the date of conversion, or, at the Corporation's option, in lieu of paying cash for the accrued and unpaid dividends, issue that number of whole shares of Common Stock which is equal to the quotient of the amount of such unpaid and accrued dividends to the date of conversion on the shares of Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock so converted divided by th e Stock Dividend Price, as defined in Part 3 hereof, in effect at the date of conversion.

 4.3             Mechanics of Conversion . Any holder of the Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock who wishes to exercise its Conversion Rights pursuant to Section 4.1 of this Part 4 must, if such shares are not being held in escrow by the Corporation's attorneys, surrender the certificate therefor at the principal executive office of the Corporation, and give written notice, which may be via facsimile transmission, to the Corporation at such office that it elects to convert the same (the "Conversion Notice"). In the event that the shares of Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock are being held in escrow by the Corporation's attorneys, no delivery of the certificates shall be required. The Corporation shall, within five (5) business days after receipt of an appropriate and timely Conversion Notice (and certificate, if necessary), issue to such holder of Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock or its agent a certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he shall be entitled; it being expressly agreed that until and unless the holder delivers written notice to the Corporation to the contrary, all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock hereunder are to be delivered by the Corporation to a party designated in writing by the holder in the Conversion Notice for the account of the holder and such shall be deemed valid delivery to the holder of such shares of Common Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made only after both the certificate for the shares of Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock to be converted have been surrendered and the Conversion Notice is received by the Corporation (or in the event that no surrender of the Certificate is required, then only upon the receipt by the Corporation of the Conversion Notice) (the "Conversion Documents"), and the person or entity whose name is noted on the certificate evidencing such shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock at and after such time. In the event that the Conversion Notice is sent via facsimile transmission, the Corporation shall be deemed to have received such Conversion Notice on the first business day on which such facsimile Conversion Notice is actually received. If the Corporation fails to deliver to the holder or its agent the certificate representing the shares of Common Stock that the holder is entitled to receive as a result of such conversion of the Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock within seven (7) business days after receipt by the Corporation from the holder of an appropriate and timely Conversion Notice and certificates pursuant to the terms of this Section 4.3 ("Seven (7) Business Day Period"), then, upon the written demand of RBB Bank Aktiengesellschaft ("RBB Bank"), the holder of the Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock, for payment of the penalty described below in this Section 4.3, which demand must be received by the Corporation no later than ten (10) calendar days after the expiration of such Seven (7) Business Day Period, the Corporation shall pay to RBB Bank the following penalty for each business day after the Seven (7) Business Day Period until the Corporation delivers to the holder or its agent the certificate representing the shares of Common Stock that the holder is entitled to receive as a result of such conversion: business day eight (8) - U.S. $1,000; business day nine (9) - U.S. $2,000, and each business day thereafter an amount equal to the penalty due on the immediately preceding business day times two (2) until the Corporation delivers to the holder or its agent the certificate representing the shares of Common Stock that the holder is entitled to recei ve as a result of such conversion. 
   
 4.4             Merger or Consolidation . In case of either (a) any merger or consolidation to which the Corporation is a party (collectively, the "Merger"), other than a Merger in which the Corporation is the surviving or continuing corporation, or (b) any sale or conveyance to another corporation of all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Corporation (collectively, the "Sale"), and such Merger or Sale becomes effective (x) while any shares of Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock are outstanding and prior to the date that the Corporation's Registration Statement covering up to 1,379,311 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock is declared effective by the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission or (y) prior to the end of the restriction periods in Section 4.1, then, in such event, the Corporation or such successor corporation, as the case may be, shall make appropriate provision so that the holder of each share of Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have the right to convert such share of Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities and property receivable upon such Merger or Sale by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock could have been converted into immediately prior to such Merger or Sale, subject to adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adj ustments provided for in this Part 4.

 4.5            Adjustments to Conversion Price for Stock Dividends and for Combinations or Subdivisions of Common Stock. If the Corporation at any time or from time to time while shares of Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding shall declare or pay, without consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock, or shall effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock (by stock split, reclassification or otherwise man by payment of a dividend in Common Stock or in any right to acquire Common Stock), or if the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Price in effect immediately before such event shall, concurrently with the effectiveness o f such event, be proportionately decreased or increased, as appropriate. 
   
 4.6             Adjustments for Reclassification and Reorganization . If the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for in Section 4.4 hereof), the Conversion Price shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted so that the Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders of Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion of the Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock immediately before that change. 
   
 4.7             Common Stock Duly Issued . All Common Stock which may be issued upon conversion of Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock will, upon issuance, be duly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens, and charges with respect to the issue thereof. 
   
 4.8             Notice of Adjustments . Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of any Conversion Price pursuant to this Part 4, the Corporation, at its expense, within a reasonable period of time, shall compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock a notice setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based.

 4.11             Fractional Shares . No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any share or shares of Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock (including fractions thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share, If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of a fractional share of Common Stock, such fractional share shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share. 
   
 4.12             Notices . Any notices required by the provisions of this Part 4 to be given to the holders of shares of Series 12 Class L Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at his address appearing on the books of the Corporation.

 RESTRICTIONS AND CONDITIONS ATTACHING TO THE 
 SERIES 13 CLASS M CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK 
   
 RE:     DESIGNATION OF SERIES 13 CLASS M PREFERRED STOCK. 
   
 RESOLVED:            That The designations, powers, preferences and rights of the Series 13 Class M Convertible Preferred Stock be, and they hereby are, as set forth below: 
   
 1.            Number of Shares of Common Stock of Series 13 Class M Convertible Preferred Stock 
   
The Corporation hereby authorizes the issuance of up to two thousand two hundred fifty-two (2,252) shares of Series 13 Class M Convertible Preferred Stock par value $.001 per share (the "Preferred Stock"). This Preferred Stock shall pay an annual dividend based on a 365 day calendar year of 4% of the Liquidation Value (as defined in Section 3 hereof) ("Dividend Rate"), payable semiannually within ten (10) business days after each subsequent June 30th and December 31st (each a "Dividend Declaration Date"), and shall be payable in cash or shares of the Corporation's par value $.001 per share common stock (Common Stock) at the Corporation's option. The first Dividend Declaration Date shall be December 31st, 1998. 
   
In the event that the Corporation elects to pay the accrued dividends due as of a Dividend Declaration Date on the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock in Common Stock of the Corporation, the Holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall receive that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of (a) the quotient of (i) the Dividend Rate divided by (ii) the average of the closing bid quotation of the Corporation's Common Stock as reported on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system ("NASDAQ"), or if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NASDAQ but is listed for trading on a national securities exchange, the average closing bid price of the Common Stock as quoted on such national exchange, for the five (5) trading days immediately prior to the Dividend Declaration Date (the "Stock Dividend Price"), times (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed during the period for which the dividend is to be paid, and the denominator of which is 365. Dividends on the Preferred Stock shall be cumulative, and no dividends or other distributions shall be paid or declared or set aside for payment on the Corporation's Common Stock until all accrued and unpaid dividends on all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall have been paid or declared and set aside for payment.

 2.            Voting. 
   
Except as provided under Section 242 of the GCL, holders of Preferred Stock (the "Holders") shall not have the right to vote on any matter. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 242 of the GCL or Section 4 hereof, the number of authorized shares of any class or classes of stock of the Corporation may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242 of the GCL. 
   
 3.            Liquidation. 
   
In the event of a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Corporation, the Holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution to holders of its capital stock, before any payment or distribution shall be made to holders of shares of Common Stock or any other class of stoc k ranking junior to the Preferred Stock, an amount per share of Preferred Stock equal to  $1,000 (the "Liquidation Value") plus any accrued and unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock. If upon such liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the assets to be distributed among the Holders of Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit payment to the Holders of Preferred Stock of the amount distributable as aforesaid, then the entire assets of the Corporation to be so distributed shall be distributed ratably among the Holders of Preferred Stock and shares of such other classes or series ranking on a parity with the shares of this Preferred Stock in proportion to the full distributable amounts for which holders of all such parity shares are entitled upon such distribution, liquidation, or winding up. Upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, after the Holders of Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full the amounts to which they shall be entitled, the remaining net assets of the Corporation may be distributed to the holders of stock ranking on liquidation junior to the Preferred Stock and the Holders of the Preferred Stock shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation. Written notice of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up, stating a payment date, the amount of the liquidation payments and the place where said liquidation payments shall be payable, shall be given by mail, postage prepaid or by telex or facsimile to non-U.S. residents, not less than 10 days prior to the payment date stated therein, to the Holders of record of Preferred Stock, such notice to be addressed to each such Holder at its address as shown by the records of the Corporation. For purposes hereof the shares of Common Stock, shall rank on liquidation junior to the Preferred Stock. 
   
 4.            Restrictions. 
   
The Corporation will not amend or modify the terms of its Restated Certificate of Incorporation so as to adversely alter or change the Preferred Stock at any time when shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding, without the approval of the Holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock given in writing or by vote at a meeting, consenting or voti ng (as the case may be) separately as a series, except where the vote or written consent of the Holders of a greater number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation is required by law or by the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, as amended.

Subject to the terms hereof, as used herein, the term Conversion Price per outstanding share of Preferred Stock shall be One Dollar and 875/100 ($1.875); except that after the expiration of one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Closing Date if the average of the closing bid price per share of Common Stock quoted on the NASDAQ (or the closing bid price of the Common Stock as quoted on the national securities exchange if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NASDAQ but is listed for trading on a national securities exchange) for the five (5) trading days immediately prior to the particular date of each Conversion Notice (as defined below) is less than Two Dollars and 34/100 ($2.34), then the Conversion Price for that particular conversion shall be eighty percent (80%) of the average of the closing bid price of the Common Stock on the NASDAQ (or if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NASDAQ but is listed for trading on a national securities exchange then eighty percent (80%) of the average of the closing bid price of the Common Stock on the national securities exchange) for the five (5) trading days immediately prior to the particular date of the Conversion Notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price shall not be less than a minimum of $1.50 per share ("Minimum Conversion Price") for a period of twenty-four (24) months from the date of issuance of the Preferred Stock. 
   
If any of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock are converted, in whole or in part, into Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Section 5(b), the number of shares of whole Common Stock to be issued to the Holder as a result of such conversion shall be determined by dividing (a) the aggregate Stated Value of the Preferred Stock so surrendered for conversion by (b) the Conversion Price in effect on the date of that particular Conversion Notice relating to such conversion. At the time of conversion of shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay in cash to the holder thereof an amount equal to all unpaid and accrued dividends, if any, accrued thereon on the shares of Preferred so converted to the date of the Conversion Notice relating to such conversion, or, at the Corporation's option, in lieu of paying cash for the accrued and unpaid dividends, issue that number of shares of whole Common Stock which is equal to the quotient of the amount of such unpaid and accrued dividends to the date of the Conversion Notice relating to such conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock so converted divided by the Stock Dividend Price, in effect at the date of the Conversion Notice relating to such conversion.

 (d)            Issuance of Certificates - Time Conversion Effected. Promptly, but in no event more than six (6) business days, after the receipt by facsimile of the Conversion Notice referred to in Subparagraph (5)(c); and provided within the six (6) business days the Corporation receives the certificate or certificates for the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, the Corporation shall issue and deliver, or cause to be issued and delivered, to the Holder, registered in the name of the Holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock are converted. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been effected as of the close of business on the date on which the telecopy or facsimile Conversion Notice shall have been received by the Corporation, and the rights of the Holder of such share or shares of Preferred Stock shall cease, at such time, and the Holder or Holders shall be deemed to have become the Holder or Holders of record of the shares of Common Stock represented thereby. 
   
In the event that the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred, is not delivered within six (6) business days of the date the Company receives the Conversion Notice, the Company shall pay to the Buyer, by wire transfer, as liquidated damages for such failure and not as a penalty, for each $100,000 of Preferred sought to be converted, $500 for each of the first five (5) calendar days and $1,000 per calendar day thereafter that the shares of Common Stock are not delivered, which liquidated damages shall begin to run from the seventh (7th) business day after the Conversion Date.

The Company understands that a delay in the issuance of the shares of Common Stock could result in economic loss to the Holder.

In the event of a Merger or Sale, where the Corporation is not the surviving Corporation, the Holder shall have the right to redeem all of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock at 120% of the Liquidation Value of each share of Preferred Stock then outstanding plus all accrued and unpaid dividends (the "Redemption Amount"). The Corporation shall pay this Redemption Amount in cash within ten (10) business days of receipt by the Corporation of notice from the Holder, and receipt by the Corporation of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock duly endorsed by the Holder to the Corporation.

 (h)            Adjustments for Reclassification and Reorganization . If the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of Common Stock of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination or shares of Common Stock provided for in Section 5(g) hereof), the Conversion Price then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted so that the Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders of Preferred Stock would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number of shares of Common Stock of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion of the Preferred Stock immediately before that change.

If the redemption occurs after the first year after the first issuance of Series 13 Class M Preferred Stock, then, upon receipt of the Redemption Notice, any holder of Series 13 Class M Preferred Stock shall have five business days during which it may exercise the option, at its sole election, to specify what portion of its Series 13 Class M Preferred Stock called for redemption in the Redemption Notice shall be redeemed as provided in this Part 6 or converted into Common Stock in the manner provided in Part 5 hereof, except that, notwithstanding any provision of such Part 5 to the contrary, after one year from the date of first issuance of the Preferred Stock, such holder shall have the right to convert into Common Stock that number of Series 13 Class M   Preferred Stock called for redemption in the Redemption Notice. 
   
 (d)            Surrender of Certificates. On or before the Redemption Date in respect of any Series 13 Class M Preferred Stock, each holder of such shares Shall surrender the required certificate or certificates representing such shares to the Corporation in the manner and at the place designated in the Redemption Notice, and upon the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price for such shares shall be made payable, in the manner provided hereof, to the order of the person whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof, and each surrendered share certificate shall be canceled and retired. If a share certificate is surrendered and all the shares evidenced thereby are not being redeemed (as described below), the Corporation shall cause the Series 13 Class M Preferred Stock which are not being redeemed to be registered in the names of the persons or entity whose names appear as the owners on the respective surrendered share certificates and deliver such certificate to such person. 
   
 (e)            Payment. On the Redemption Date in respect of any Series 13 Class M Preferred Stock or prior thereto, the Corporation shall deposit with any bank or trust company having a capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000, as a trust fund, a sum equal to the aggregate Redemption Price of all such shares called from redemption (less the aggregate Redemption Price for those Series 13 Class M Preferred Stock in respect of which the Corporation has received notice from the holder thereof of its election to convert Series 13 Class M Preferred Stock into Common Stock), with irrevocable instructions and authority to the bank or trust company to pay, on or after the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price to the respective holders upon the surrender of their share certificates. The deposit shall constitute full payment for the shares to their holders, and from and after the date of the deposit the redeemed shares shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding, and holders thereof shall cease to be shareholders with respect to such shares and shall have no rights with respect thereto except the rights to receive from the bank or trust company payments of the Redemption Price of the shares, without interest, upon surrender of their certificates thereof. My funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of one year following the Redemption Date shall be released or repaid to the Corporation, after which the former holders of shares called for redemption shall be entitled to receive payment of the Redemption Price in respect of their shares only from the Corporation.

The Liquidation Value of the Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock shall be $1,000.00 per share (the "Dividend Rate"). The dividend is payable semi-annually within seven (7) business days after each of December 31 and June 30 of each year, commencing December 31, 1999 (each, a "Dividend Declaration Date"). Dividends shall be paid only with respect to shares of Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock actually issued and outstanding on a Dividend Declaration Date and to holders of record as of the Dividend Declaration Date. Dividends shall accrue from the first day of the semi-annual period in which such dividend may be payable, except with respect to the first semi-annual dividend which shall accrue from August 3, 1999. In the event that the Corporation elects to pay dividends in Common Stock of the Corporation, each holder of the Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock shall receive shares of Common Stock of the Corporation equal to the quotient of (i) the Dividend Rate in effect on the applicable Dividend Declaration Date dividend by (ii) the average of the closing bid quotation of the Common Stock as reported on the over-the-counter market, or the closing sale price if listed on a national securities exchange, for the five (5) trading days immediately prior to the Dividend Declaration Date (the "Stock Dividend Price").

 -4- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4.2             Right to Convert . The Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock may be convertible into shares of Common Stock at any time on or after April 20, 2000. 
   
 4.3             Conversion Price . As used herein, the term Conversion Price shall be the product of (i) the average closing bid quotation of the Common Stock as reported on the over-the-counter market, or the closing sale price if listed on a national securities exchange, for the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the date of the Conversion Notice referred to in Section 4.4 below multiplied by (ii) seventy-five percent (75 %), subject to the provisions of this Section 4.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price shall not be (i) less than a minimum of $1.50 per share for a period of twenty-four (24) months from April 20, 1999. or, after twenty-four (24) months from April 20, 1999, a minimum of $.50 per share (as applicable, the "Minimum Conversion Price") or (ii) more than a maximum of $1.50 per share ("Maximum Conversion Price"). If, after July 1,1996, the Corporation sustains a net loss, on a consolidated basis, in each of two (2) consecutive quarters, as determined under generally accepted accounting principles, the Minimum Conversion Price shall be reduced $.25 a share, but there shall be no change to, or reduction of, the Maximum Conversion Price. For the purpose of determining whether the Corporation has had a net loss in each of two (2) consecutive quarters, at no time shall a quarter that has already been considered in such determination he considered in any subsequent determination (as an example the third quarter of 1996 in which there is a net profit and the fourth quarter of 1996 in which there is a net loss shall he considered as two consecutive quarters, and, as a result the fourth quarter of 1996 shall not be considered along with the first quarter of 1997 as two (2) consecutive quarters, but the first quarter of 1997 must be considered with the second quarter of 1997 for the purposes of such determination). For the purposes of this Section 4.3, a "quarter" is a three (3) month period ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31. If any of the outstanding shares of Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock are converted, in whole or in part, into Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Part 4, the number of shares of whole Common Stock to be issued to the holder as a result of such conversion shall be determined by dividing (a) the aggregate Liquidation Value of the Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock so surrendered for conversion by (b) the Conversion Price in effect at the date of the conversion. At the time of conversion of shares of the Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay in cash to the holder thereof an amount equal to all unpaid and accrued dividends, if any, accrued thereon to the date of conversion, or, at the Corporations option, in lieu of paying cash for the accrued and unpaid dividends, issue that number of shares of whole Common Stock which is equal to the product of dividing the amount of such unpaid and accrued dividends to the date of conversion on the shares of Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock so convened by the Conversion Price in e ffect at the date of conversion.

 4.4           Mechanics of Conversion . Any holder of the Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock who wishes to exercise its Conversion Rights pursuant to the terms of this Part 4 must, if such shares are not being held in escrow by the Corporation's attorneys surrender the certificate therefor at the principal executive office of the Corporation, and give written notice, which may be via facsimile transmission, to the Corporation at such office that it elects to convert the same (the "Conversion Notice"). In the event that the shares of Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock are being held in escrow by the Corporation's attorneys, no delivery of the certificates shall be required. No Conversion Notice with respect to any shares of Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock can be given prior to the time such shares of Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock are eligible for conversion in accordance with the provision of Section 4.1 above. Any such premature Conversion Notice shall automatically be null and void. The Corporation shall, within five (5) business days after receipt of an appropriate and timely Conversion Notice (and certificate, if necessary), issue to such holder of Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock or its agent a certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he shall be entitled; it being expressly agreed that until and unless the holder delivers written notice to the Corporation to the contrary, all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock hereunder are to be delivered by the Corporation to a party designated in writing by the holder in the Conversion Notice for the account of the holder and such shall be deemed valid delivery to the holder of such shares of Common Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made only after both the certificate for the shares of Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock to be converted have been surrendered and the Conversion Notice is received by the Corporation (or in the event that no surrender of the Certificate is required, then only upon the receipt by the Corporation of the Conversion Notice) (the "Conversion Documents"), and the person or entity whose name is noted on the certificate evidencing such shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion Shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock at and after such time. In the event that the Conversion Notice is sent via facsimile transmission, the Corporation shall be deemed to have received such Conversion Notice on the first business day on which such facsimile Conversion Notice is actually received. If the Corporation fails to deliver to the holder or its agent the certificate representing the shares of Common Stock that the holder is entitled to receive as a result of such conversion within five (5) business days after receipt by the Corporation from the holder of an appropriate and timely Conversion Notice and certificates pursuant to the terms of this Section 4.4, the Corporation shall pay to the holder U.S. $1,000 for each day that the Corporation is late in delivering such certificate to the holder or its agent. 
   
 4.5            Adjustments to Conversion Price for Stock Dividends and for Combinations or Subdivisions of Common Stock . If the Corporation at any time or from time to time while shares of Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding shall declare or pay, without consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock, or shall effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock (by stock split, reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock or in any right to acquire Common Stock), or if the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Price in effect immediately before such event shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such event, be proportionately decreased or increased, as appropriate. If the Corporation shall declare or pay, without consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock payable in any right to acquire Common stock for no consideration, then the Corporation shall be deemed to have made a dividend payable in Common Stock in an amount of shares equal to the maximum number of shar es issuable upon exercise of such rights to acquire Common Stock. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 -6- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4.6.           Adjustments for Reclassification and Reorganization .  If the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for in Section 4.5 hereof), the Conversion Price then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted so that the Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders of Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the holders upon conversion of the Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock immediately before that change. 
   
 4.7             Common Stock Duly Issued .  All Common Stock which may be issued upon conversion of Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock will, upon issuance, be duly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens, and charges with respect to the issue thereof. 
   
 4.8             Notice of Adjustments .  Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of any Conversion Price pursuant to this Part 4, the Corporation, at its expense, within a reasonable period of time, shall compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock a notice setting forth such adjustment or readjus tment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based. 
   
 4.9             Issue Taxes . The Corporation shall pay any and all issue and other taxes that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion of the Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock pursuant thereto;  provided however , that the Corporation shall not be obligated to pay any transfer taxes resulting from any transfer requested by any holder of Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock in connection with such conversion, 
   
 4.10          Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion . The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall, from time to time, be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series 14 Class N Preferred stock and, if at any time, the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall, not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in reasonable efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation.

 4.11          Fractional Shares .  No fractional share shall be issued upon the conversion of any share or shares of Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock (including fractions  thereof) issuable upon conversion of more than one share of Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock by a holder thereof shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the conversion would result in the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of a fractional share of Common Stock, such fractional  share shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share. 
   
 4.12          Notices . Any notices required by the provisions of this Part 4 to be given to the holders of shares of Series 14 Class N Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at his address appearing on the books of the Corporation. 
   
 4.13          Business Day . As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a day when the federal and state banks located in the State of New York are required or permitted to close.

 4.3        Conversion Price. Subject to the terms hereof, as used herein, the Conversion Price per outstanding share of Series 15 Class O Preferred Stock shall be $1.8125, except that, in the event he average closing bid price per share of the Common Stock as reported on the  over -the-counter market, or the closing sale price if listed on a national securities exchange, for the five (5) trading days prior to the particular date of conversion shall be less than $2.265, the Conversion Price   for only such particular conversion shall be the product of the average closing bid  quotation of the Common Stock as reported on the over-the-counter market, or the closing sale price if listed on a national securities exchange, for the five (5) trading  days immediately preceding the date of the Conversion Notice referred to in  Section 4.4 below in connection with such conversion multiplied by eighty percent   (80%),  subject to the provisions of this Section 4.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Conversion Price shall not be less than a minimum of $1.50 per share ("Minimum Conversion Price")  for a period of twenty-four (24) months from April 20, 1999. If any of the outstanding shares of Series 15 Class O Preferred Stock are converted, in whole or in part, into Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Part 4, the number of shares of whole Common Stock to be issued to the  holder as a result of such conversion shall be determined by dividing (a) the aggregate Liquidation Value of the Series 15 Class O Preferred Stock so surrendered for conversion by (b) the Conversion Price as of such conversion. At  the time of conversion of shares of the Series 15 Class O Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay in cash to the holder thereof an amount to all unpaid and accrued dividends, if any, accrued thereon to the date of conversion, or at the Corporation's option, in lieu of paying cash for the accrued and unpaid dividends, issue that number of whole shares of Common Stock which is equal to the quotient of the amount of such unpaid and accrued dividends to the date of conversion on the shares of Series 15 Class O Preferred Stock so converted divided by the Stock Dividend Price, as defined in Part 3 hereof, in effect at the date of conversion.

In the event that the shares of Series 15 Class O Preferred Stock are being held in escrow by the Corporation's attorneys, no delivery of the certificates shall be required. The Corporation shall, within five (5) business days after receipt of an appropriate and timely Conversion Notice (and certificate, if necessary), issue to such holder of Series 15 Class O Preferred Stock or its agent a certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock to which he shall be entitled; it being expressly agreed the until and unless the holder delivers written notice to the Corporation to the contrary, all shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series 15 Class O Preferred Stock hereunder are to be delivered by the Corporation to a party designated in writing by the holder in the Conversion Notice for the account  of the holder and such shall be deemed valid delivery to the holder of such shares of Common Stock. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made only after both the certificate for the shares of Series 15 Class O Preferred Stock to be converted have been surrendered and the Conversion Notice is received by the Corporation (or in the event that no surrender of the Certificate is required, then only upon the receipt by the Corporation of the Conversion Notice) (the "Conversion Documents"), and the person or entity whose name is noted on the certificate evidencing such shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purpose as the record holder of such shares of Common Stock at and after such time. In the event that the Conversion Notice is sent via facsimile transmission, the Corporation shall be deemed to have received  such Conversion Notice on the first business day on which such facsimile Conversion Notice is actually received. If the Corporation fails to deliver to the holder or its agent the certificate representing the shares of Common Stock that the holder is entitled to receive as a result of such conversion of the Series 15 Class O Preferred Stock within seven (7) business days after receipt by the Corporation from the holder of an appropriate and timely Conversion Notice and certificates pursuant to the terms of this section 4.4 ("Seven (7) Business Day Period"), then, upon the written demand of RBB Bank Aktiengesellschaft ("RBB Bank"), the holder of the Series 15 Class O Preferred Stock, for payment of the penalty described below in this Section 4.4, which demand must be received by the Corporate no later than ten (10) calender days after the expiration of such Seven (7) Business Day Period, the Corporation shall pay to RBB Bank the following penalty for each business day after the Seven (7) Business Day Period until the Corporation delivers to the holder or its agent the certificate representing the shares of Common Stock that the holder is entitled to receive as a result of such conversion: business day eight (8) - U.S. $1,000; business day nine (9) - U.S. $2,000, and each business day thereafter an amount equal to the penalty due on the immediately preceding business day times two (2) until the Corporation delivers to the holder or its agent the certificate representing the  shares of Common Stock that the holder is entitled to receive as a result of such conversion.

If the Corporation at any  time or from time to time while shares of Series 15 Class O Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding shall declare or  pay, without consideration, any dividend on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock, or shall effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock (by stock split, reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock or in any right to acquire Common Stock), or if the outstanding shares of Common Stoc k shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or o therwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion   Price in effect immediately before such event shall, concurrently with the   effectiveness of such event, be proportionately decreased or increased, as   appropriate. 
   
 4.7         Adjustments for Reclassification and Reorganization .

 4.8        Common Stock Duly Issued .  All Common Stock which may be issued  upon conversion of Series 15 Class O Preferred Stock will, upon issuance, be duly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens, and charges with respect to the issue thereof. 
   
 4.9        Notice of Adjustments .  Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or  readjustment of any Conversion Price pursuant to this Part 4, the Corporation, at its expense, within a reasonable period of time, shall compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Series 15 Class O Preferred Stock a notice setting forth such adjustment  or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based.

If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the conversion would result in the issuance of a fractional share of Common Stock, such fractional share shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share. 
   
 4.13        Notices. Any notices required by the provisions of this Part 4 to be given to the holders of shares of Series 15 Class O Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at his address appearing on the books of the Corporation.

 (b)     Conversion Dates. The Preferred Stock may be convertible into shares of Common Stock at any time after April 20, 2000. 
   
 (c)     Right to Convert; Conversion Price. Subject to the terms hereof, as used herein, the term Conversion Price per outstanding share of Preferred Stock shall be One Dollar and 875/100 ($1.875); except that after the expiration of one hundred and eighty (180) days after the Closing Date if the average of the closing bid price per share of Common Stock quoted on the NASDAQ (or the closing bid price of the Common Stock as quoted on the national securities exchange if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NASDAQ but is listed for trading on a national securities exchange) for the five (5) trading days immediately prior to the particular date of each Conversion  Notice  (as defined below) is less than Two Dollars and 34/100 ($2.34), then the Conversion Price for that particular conversion shall be eighty percent (80% )  of  the average of the closing bid price of the Common Stock on the NASDAQ (or if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NASDAQ but is listed for trading on a national securities exchange then eighty percent (80%) of the average of the closing bid price of the Common Stock on the national securities exchange) for the five (5) trading days immediately prior to the particular date of the Conversion Notice.

 (d)      Conversion Notice.  The right of conversion shall  he exercised by the Holder thereof by telecopying or faxing an executed and completed written notice signed by an authorized representative of the Holder, ("Conversion Notice") to the Corporation that the Holder elects to convert a specified number of shares of Preferred Stock representing a specified Stated Value thereof into shares of Common Stock and by delivering by express c ourier the certificate or certificates of Preferred Stock being  converted to the Corporation at its principal office (or such other office or agency of the Corporation as the Corporation may designate by notice in writing to the Holders of the Preferred Stock). The business date indicated on a Conversion Notice which is telecopied to and received by the Corporation in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be deemed a Conversion Date. The Conversion Notice shall include therein the Stated Value of shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and a calculation (a) of the Stock Dividend Price, (b) the Conversion Price, and (c)  the  number   of  Shares of Common Stock to be issued in connection with such conversion.

 (e)       Issuance of Certificates - Time Conversion Effected. Promptly, but in no event more than six (6) business days, after the receipt by facsimile of the Conversion Notice referred to in Subparagraph (5)(c); and provided within the six (6) business days the Corporation receives the certificate or certificates for the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, the Corporation shall issue and deliver, or cause to be issued and delivered, to the Holder, registered in the name of the Holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock are converted. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been effected as of the close of business on the date on which the telecopy or facsimile Conversion Notice shall have been received by the Corporation, and the rights of the Holder of such share or shares of Preferred Stock shall cease, at such time, and the Holder or Holders shall be deemed to have become the Holder or Holders of record of the shares of Common Stock represented thereby. 
   
In the event that the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred, are not delivered within six (6) business days of the date the Corporation receives the Conversion Notice, the Corporation shall pay to the Holder, by wire transfer, as liquidated damages for such failure and not as a penalty, for each $100,000 of Preferred sought to be converted, $500 for each of the first five (5) calendar days and $1,000 per calendar day thereafter that the shares of Common Stock are not delivered, which liquidated damages shall begin to run from the seventh (7th) business day after the Conversion Date. Any and all payments required pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable only in cash. Notwithstanding the above, liquidated damages shall not exceed $2,000.00 per day. In addition to the liquidated damages set forth herein, in the event the Corporation fails to deliver the shares of Common Stock within six  (6) business days after the Conversion date, the Corporation agrees to issue the larger number of shares   of Common Stock derived from (i) the original Conversion Notice, or (ii) utilizing the  five lowest closing bid prices of the Corporation's shares of Common Stock beginning on the Conversion Date and ending on the day the shares of Common Stock are delivered. The Corporation understands that a delay in the issuance of the shares of Common Stock could result in economic loss to the Holder.

In the event of a Merger or Sale, where the Corporation is not the surviving Corporation, the Holder shall have the right to redeem all of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock at 120% of the Liquidation Value of each share of Preferred Stock then outstanding plus all accrued and unpaid dividends (the "Redemption Amount").

The deposit shall constitute full payment for the shares to their holders, and from and after the date of the deposit the redeemed shares shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding, and holders thereof shall cease to be shareholders with respect to such shares and shall have no rights with respect thereto except the rights to receive from the bank or trust company payments of the Redemption Price of the shares, without interest, upon surrender of their certificates thereof.

 RESTRICTIONS AND CONDITIONS ATTACHING TO THE 
 SERIES 17 CLASS Q CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK 
   
 RE: DESIGNATION OF SERIES 17 CLASS Q CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK. 
   
 RESOLVED:      That the designations, powers, preferences and rights of the Series 17 Class Q Convertible Preferred Stock be, and they hereby are, as set forth below: 
 
     
 1. 
 
Designation, Number of Shares of Preferred Stock of Series 17 Class Q Convertible Preferred Stock and Dividends. 
 
 
   
The Corporation hereby authorizes the issuance of up to two thousand five hundred (2,500) shares of Series 17 Class Q Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $.001 per share (the "Preferred Stock"). The holders of the Preferred Stock (individually, the "Holder," and collectively, the "Holders") are entitled to receive if, when and as declared by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board") out of funds legally available therefore, cumulative dividends at an annual dividend rate, based on a 365 day calendar year, of 5% of the Liquidation Value (as defined in Section 3 hereof) ("Dividend Rate") for each share of the Preferred Stock then issued and outstanding as of the acceptable declaration of such dividend, payable semiannually within ten (10) business days after each subsequent June 30th and December 31st (each a "Dividend Declaration Date"), and shall be payable in cash or shares of the Corporation ' s common stock, par value $.001 per share ("Common Stock"), at the Corporation 's option. The first Dividend Declaration Date shall be December 31st, 2001. Dividends shall be paid only with respect to the shares of Preferred Stock actually issued and outstanding on the Dividend Declaration Date and to Holders of record on the Dividend Declaration Date. Dividends shall accrue from the first day of the semi-annual dividend period in which such dividend may be payable, except with respect to the first semi-annual dividend which shall accrue from the date of the issuance of the Preferred Stock. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 - 1 - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
In the event that the Board elects to pay the accrued dividends due as of a Dividend Declaration Date on the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock in Common Stock of the Corporation, the Holder of each share of Preferred Stock shall receive that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of (a) the quotient of (i) the Dividend Rate divided by (ii) the average of the  average closing bid quotation of the Corporation's Common Stock as reported on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system ("NASDAQ"), or if the Common Stock is not listed for trading on the NASDAQ but is listed for trading on a national securities exchange, the average closing price of the Common Stock as quoted on such national exchange, for the five (5) trading days immediately prior to the Dividend Declaration Date (the "Stock Dividend Price"), times (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days elapsed during the period for which the dividend is to be paid, and the denominator of which is 365. Dividends on the Preferred Stock shall be cumulative, and no dividends or other distributions shall be paid or declared or set aside for payment on the Corporation's Common Stock until all accrued and unpaid dividends on all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall have been paid or declared and set aside for payment. 
   
 2.           Voting. 
   
Except as provided under Section 242(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("GCL"), the Preferred Stock shall not have any voting rights and the Holders of the Preferred Stock shall not have the right to vote on any matter. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 242 of the GCL, the number of authorized shares of any class or classes of stock of the Corporation may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242 of the GCL. 
   
 3.           Liquidation. 
   
In the event of a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Corporation, the Holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Corporation legally available for distribution to holders of its capital stock, before any payment or distribution shall be made to holders of shares of Common Stock or any other class of stock ranking junior to the Preferred Stock, an amount per share of the Preferred Stock equal to $1.000 (the "Liquidation Value"), plus any accrued and unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock. If upon such liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the assets to be distributed among the Holders of the Preferred Stock shall be insufficient to permit payment to the Holders of the Preferred Stock of the amount distributable as aforesaid, then the entire assets of the Corporation to be so distributed shall be distributed ratably among the Holders of the Preferred Stock and shares of such other classes or series ranking on a parity with the shares of the Preferred Stock in proportion to the full distributable amounts for which holders of all such parity shares are entitled upon such distribution, liquidation, or winding up. Upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, after the Holders of Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full the amounts to which they shall be entitled, the remaining net assets of the Corporation may be distributed to the holders of stock ranking on liquidation junior to the Preferred Stock and the Holders of the Preferred Stock shall have no right or claim to any of the remaining assets of the Corporation. Written notice of such liquidation, dissolution or winding up, stating a payment date, the amount of the liquidation payments and the place where said liquidation payments shall be payable, shall  be given by mail, postage prepaid or by telex or facsimile to non-U.S. residents, not less than 10 days prior to the payment date stated therein, to the Holders of record of the Preferred Stock, such notice to be addressed to each such Holder at its address as shown by the records of the Corporation. For purposes hereof, the shares of Common Stock shall rank on liquidation junior to the Preferred Stock.

 4.           Optional Conversion. 
   
The Holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall have the following conversion rights to convert the shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock of the Corporation as follows; 
   
 (a)           Intentionally left blank. 
   
 (b)             Right to Convert; Conversion Price. Subject to the terms hereof, as used herein the term Conversion Price per outstanding share of Preferred Stock shall be One Dollar and 50/100 ($1.50). If any of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock are converted, in whole or in part, into Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Section 4, the number of shares of whole Common Stock to be issued as a result of such conversion shall be determined by dividing (a) the aggregate Liquidation Value of the Preferred Stock so surrendered for conversion by (b) the Conversion Price in effect on the date of that particular Conversion Notice relating to such conversion. At the time of conversion of shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay in cash to the Holder thereof an amount equal to all unpaid and accrued dividends, if any, accrued thereon on the shares of the Preferred Stock so converted to the date of the Conversion Notice relating to the shares of Preferred Stock so converted under such conversion, or, at the Corporation 's option, in lieu of paying cash for the accrued and unpaid dividends, issue that number shares of whole Common Stock which is equal to the quotient of the amount of such unpaid and accrued dividends to the date of the Conversion Notice relating to such conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock so converted divided by the Stock Dividend Price in effect at the date of the Conv ersion Notice relating to such conversion. 
   
 (c)             Conversion Notice. The right of conversion shall be exercised by the Holder thereof by telecopying or faxing an executed and completed written notice signed by an authorized representative of the Holder ("Conversion Notice"), to the Corporation that the Holder elects to convert a specified number of shares of Preferred Stock representing a specified Liquidation Value thereof into shares of Common Stock and by delivering by express courier the certificate or certificates of Preferred Stock being converted to the Corporation at its principal office (or such other office or agency of the Corporation as the Corporation may designate by notice in writing to the Holders of the Preferred Stock). The business date indicated on a Conversion Notice which is telecopied to and received by the Corporation in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be deemed a Conversion Date. The Conversion Notice shall include therein the Liquidation Value of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, and a calculation (a) of the Stock Dividend Price, (b) the Conversion Price, and (c) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued in connection with such conversion. The Corporation shall have the right to review the calculations included in the Conversion Notice, and shall provide notice of any discrepancy or dispute therewith within five (5) business days of the receipt thereof. The Holder shall deliver to the Corporation an original Conversion Notice and the original Preferred to be converted within three (3) business days from the date of the Conversion Notice. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 - 3 - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 (d)             Issuance of Certificates - Time   Conversion   Effected. Promptly, but in no event more than fifteen (15) business days, after the receipt by facsimile of the Conversion Notice referred to in Section 4(c); and provided within the ten (10) business days the Corporation receives the certificate or certificates for the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, the Corporation shall issue and deliver, or cause to be issued and delivered, to the Holder, registered in the name of the Holder, a certificate or certificates for the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock are converted. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been effected as of the close of business on the date on which the telecopy or facsimile Conversion Notice shall have been received by the Corporation, and the rights of the Holder of such share or shares of Preferred Stock shall cease at such time, and the Holder or Holders shall be deemed to have become the holder or holders of record of the shares of Common Stock represented thereby. 
   
 (e)             Fractional Shares of Common Stock. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of any Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock.  All fractional shares of Common Stock shall be aggregated and then rounded down to the nearest whole share of Common Stock. In case the number of shares of Preferred Stock represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered pursuant to this Section 4(c) exceeds the number of shares of Common Stock converted, the Corporation shall, upon such conversion, execute and deliver to the Holder, at the expense of the Corporation, a new certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Preferred Stock represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered which are not to be converted. 
   
 (f)             Merger or Consolidation. In case of either (a) any merger or consolidation to which the Corporation is a party (collectively, the "Merger"), other than a Merger in which the Corporation is the surviving or continuing corporation, or (b) any sale or conveyance to another corporation of all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Corporation (collectively, the "Sale"), and such Merger or Sale becomes effective while any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding and prior to the date that the Corporation's Registration Statement covering all the Conversion Shares is declared effective by the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), the Corporation or such successor corporation as the case may be, shall make appropriate provision so that the Holder of each share of Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have the right to convert such share of Preferred Stock into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities and property receivable upon such Merger or Sale by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock could have been converted into immediately prior to such Merger or Sale, subject to adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 4. 
   
 (g)            Adjustments to Conversion Price for Stock Dividends and for Combinations or Subdivisions of Common Stock. If the Corporation, at any time or from, time to time while shares of Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding, shall declare or pay, any dividend on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock, or shall effect a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Common Stock (by stock split, reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in Common Stock), or if the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then the Conversion Price in effect immediately before such event shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such event, be proportionately decreased or increased, as appropriate. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 - 4 - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
   
 (h)             Adjustments for Reclassification and Reorganization. If the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of common stock of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination or shares of Common Stock provided for in Section 5(g) hereof), the Conversion Price then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted so that the Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the Holders of Preferred Stock would otherwise have been entitled to receive, a number of shares of common stock of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to receipt by the Holders upon conversion of the Preferred Stock immediately before that change. 
   
 (i)             Other Adjustments to Conversion Price. Except as provided in subsection 4(j), if, after the Closing Date and during the period that any of the Preferred Stock is issued and outstanding, the Corporation shall sell (a) any shares of Common Stock for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such sale, or (b) any rights, warrants or other securities entitling the holders thereof to convert such securities into Common Stock at a price per share (determined by dividing (i) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation in consideration of the sale of such rights, warrants or other securities plus the total amount, if any, payable to the Corporation upon exercise or conversion thereof by (ii) the number of additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of such securities) which is less than the Conversion Price in effect on the date of such sale, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted as of the date of such sale to the amount per share received and to be received by the Corporation in connection with such sale, conversion and exercise as determined above. The Holders may, if approved by the Holders of record representing a majority of the then issued and outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, waive their rights to any adjustment to the Conversion Price in connection with a particular sale covered by this Section 4(i), and, in the event of such waiver, no adjustment to the Conversion Price shall be made under this Section 4(i) as a result of such sal e. 
   
 (j) No Adjustments. No adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be required in the case of (i) the grant by the Corporation of stock options to employees of the Corporation under a Stock Option Plan approved by the stockholders of the Company or (ii) the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of stock options (a) referred to in clause (i) hereof and (b) granted by the Corporation wh ich grant had triggered an adjustment in the Conversion Price.

Prior to any date stipulated by the Corporation for the redemption of Preferred Stock (the "Redemption Date"), written notice (the "Redemption Notice") shall be mailed to each Holder of record on such notice date of the Preferred Stock. The Redemption Notice shall state: (i) the Redemption Date of such shares, (ii) the number of Preferred Stock to be redeemed from the holder to whom the Redemption Notice is addressed, (iii) instructions for surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, of a share certificate or share certificates representing the number of Preferred Stock to be redeemed from such Holder, and (iv) instructions as to how to specify to the Corporation the number of Preferred Stock to be redeemed as provided i n this Section  5. 
   
 (c)             Rights of Conversion Upon Redemption. If the redemption occurs, then, upon receipt of the Redemption Notice, any Holder of Preferred Stock shall have five business days during which it may exercise the option, at its sole election, to specify what portion of its Preferred Stock called for redemption in the Redemption Notice shall be redeemed as provided in this Section 5 or converted into Common Stock in the manne r provided in Section 4 hereof.

If a share certificate is surrendered and all the shares evidenced thereby are not being redeemed (as described below), the Corporation shall cause the Preferred Stock which are not being redeemed to be registered in the names of the persons or entity whose names appear as the owners on the respective surrendered share certificates and deliver such certificate to such person. 
   
 (e)             Payment. On the Redemption Date in respect of any Preferred Stock or prior thereto, the Corporation shall deposit with any bank or trust company having a capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000, as a trust fund, a sum equal to the aggregate Redemption Price of all such shares called from redemption (less the aggregate Redemption Price for those Preferred Stock in respect of which the Corporation has received notice from the holder thereof of its election to convert Preferred Stock into Common Stock), with irrevocable instructions and authority to the bank or  trust company to pay, on or after the Redemption Date, the Redemption Price to the respective holders upon the surrender of their share certificates. The deposit shall constitute full payment for the shares to their holders, and from and after the date of the deposit the redeemed shares shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding, and holders thereof shall cease to be shareholders with respect to such shares and shall have no rights with respect thereto except the rights to receive from the bank or trust company payments of the Redemption Price of the shares, without interest, upon surrender of their certificates thereof. Any funds so deposited and unclaimed at the end of one year following the Redemption Date shall be released or repaid to the Corporation, after which the former holders of shares called for redemption shall be entitled to receive payment of the Redemption Price in respect of their shares only from the Corporation.

 Section  2.     D ividends and Distributions . 
   
 (a)     Subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any shares of any series of the Corporation's preferred stock ranking prior and superior to the shares of Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, if any, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of Common Stock, par value $.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), of the Corporation, and of any other junior stock, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly  dividends payable in cash on the last business day of March, June, September and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1, or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of the Common Stock, or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such  event. 
   
 (b)     The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock);  provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1 per share on the Series A Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. 
   
 (c)     Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to  the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarte rly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding.

 (b)     Except as otherwise provided herein, in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, of the Corporation, in any other Certificate of Designation of the Corporation or by applicable law, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of Common Stock and the holders of any other class or series of capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.

 (iii)     redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any Common Stock or stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such Common Stock or junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock; or

 CERTIFICATE OF AMENDMENT 
 OF 
 THE RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, AS AMENDED, OF 
 PERMA-FIX ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, INC. 
   
PERMA-FIX ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, INC., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, hereby certifies as follows: 
   
 FIRST:  The name of the corporation is Perma-Fix Environmental Services, Inc. (the "Corporation"). 
   
SECOND:  At a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, resolutions were duly adopted declaring the advisability of an amendment to the Corporation's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), as follows, and providing that: 
   
The first two paragraphs of Article Fourth of the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation are hereby deleted in their entirety and replaced in their entirety by the following: 
   
 " FOURTH:  The total number of shares of capital stock that the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 77,000,000, of which 75,000,000 shall be designated as common stock, par value $.001 per share ("Common Stock"), and 2,000,000 shall be designated as preferred stock, par value $.001 per share ("Preferred Stock"). 
   
Upon this Certificate of Amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation becoming effective in accordance with the terms hereof and pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "Amendment Effective Time"), every five (5) shares of the Corporation's Common Stock (the "Old Common Stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Amendment Effective Time, will be automatically reclassified as and converted into one share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Corporation (the "New Common Stock")(such formula herein, the "Determined Ratio"). Further, every right, option and warrant to acquire shares of Old Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Amendment Effective Time shall, as of the Amendment Effective Time and without any further action, automatically be reclassified into the right to acquire one (1) share of New Common Stock based on the Determined Ratio of shares of Old Common Stock to shares of New Common Stock, but otherwise upon the terms of such right, option or warrant (except that the exercise or purchase price of such right, option or warrant  shall be proportionately adjusted). 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, the Corporation shall not be required to issue or deliver any fractional shares of New Common Stock. Each holder of such New Common Stock shall be entitled to receive for such fractional interest, and at the Amendment Effective Time any such fractional interest in such shares of New Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive, an amount in cash, without interest, determined by multiplying (i) such fractional share interest to which the holder would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the closing sale price of the Common Stock (on a post-reverse-split basis as adjusted for the amendment effected hereby) on the trading day immediately prior to the Amendment Effective Time on The NASDAQ Stock Market, or if the principal exchange on which the Common Stock is then traded is other than The NASDAQ Stock Market, such exchange as may be applicable. Shares of Common Stock that were outstanding prior to the Amendment Effective Time and that are not outstanding after the Amendment Effective Time shall resume the status of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock. 
   
Each stock certificate that, immediately prior to the Amendment Effective Time, represented shares of Old Common Stock shall, from and after the Amendment Effective Time, automatically and without the necessity of presenting the same for exchange, represent that number of whole shares of New Common Stock into which the shares of Old Common Stock represented by such certificate shall have been reclassified (as well as the right to receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares of New Common Stock as set forth above); provided, however, that each holder of record of a certificate that represented shares of Old Common Stock shall receive, upon surrender of such certificate, a new certificate representing the number of whole shares of New Common Stock into which the shares of Old Common Stock represented by such certificate shall have been reclassified, as well as any cash in lieu of fractional shares of New Common Stock to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph." 
   
THIRD:  That thereafter, pursuant to resolution of its Board of Directors, a meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation was duly called and held, upon notice in accordance with Section 222 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, at which meeting the necessary number of shares as required by statute were voted in favor of the amendment. 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
FOURTH:  This Certificate of Amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation was duly adopted at said meeting of the stockholders in accordance with the provisions of Section 242 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. 
   
FIFTH:  In accordance with Section 103(d) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, this Certificate of Amendment shall be effective as of 12:01 a.m. on October 15, 2013.
