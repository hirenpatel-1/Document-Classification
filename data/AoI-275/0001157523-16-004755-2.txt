Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date for such purpose.  The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten days after the date on which such request is received by the Secretary, adopt a resolution fixing such record date.

If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to take corporate action by written consent without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

The date on which such electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which such consent was signed.  No consent given by electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until such consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery as set forth in Section 1.08(a).

The Secretary, or such other officer of the corporation as the Board of Directors may designate, shall, as promptly as practicable, conduct a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and/or any related revocations deemed necessary and appropriate; provided, however, that if the corporate action to which the written consent relates is the removal or replacement of one or more members of the Board of Directors, the Secretary, or such other officer of the corporation as the Board of Directors may designate, shall promptly designate two persons, who may be employees of the corporation, but who shall not be members of the Board of Directors or officers of the corporation, to serve as inspectors with respect to such written consent and such inspectors shall discharge the functions of the Secretary, or such othe r officer of the corporation as the Board of Directors may designate, under this Section 1.08. 
 
 
   
 
 
 (g)            
 
No action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the Secretary, such other officer of the corporation as designated by the Board of Directors or the inspectors as appointed in accordance with Section 1.08(f), as applicable, completes its review, determines that such consents represent not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and so certifies to the Board of Direc tors for entry in the records of the corporation. 
 
 
   
 
 
 (h)            
 
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to the corporation as provided herein.

If any nominee for director in a non-contested election does not receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at a stockholder meeting, and such nominee is an incumbent director, the Nominating Committee shall assess the appropriateness of such nominee continuing to serve as director and shall recommend to the Board of Directors the action to be taken with respect to the resignation such nominee submitted in accordance with Section 2.02(b)(ii)(E).  In reaching its recommendation, the Nominating Committee may consider factors it deems relevant, including, but not limited to, the director's qualifications, the director's past and expected future contributions to the corporation, the stated reason or reasons why stockholders voted against such director's reelection, the overall composition of the Board of Directors, the availability of other qualified candidates for director and whether accepting the tendered resignation would cause the corporation to fail to meet any applicable rule or regulation (including New York Stock Exchange listing requirements and federal securities laws).  The Nominating Committee's evaluation shall begin promptly following the certification of the voting results and shall be forwarded to the Board of Directors to permit the Board of Directors to act on it no later than 90 days following the certification of the stockholder vote.  In reviewing the Nominating Committee's recommendation, the Board of Directors shall consider the factors evaluated by the Nominating Committee and such additional information and factors as the Board of Directors believes to be relevant.  The corporation shall publicly disclose the Board of Directors' decision within four business days in a Form 8-K, providing an explanation of the process by which the decision was reached and, if applicable, the reasons for not accepting the director's resignation.  Any director whose resignation is evaluated and decided upon pursuant to this provision shall not participate in the Nominating Committee's recommendation or Board of Directors' action regarding whether to accept the resignation offer.  If a majority of the members of the Nominating Committee fail to receive the required vote in favor of their elections in the same election, then those independent directors on the Board of Directors (as most recently determined by the Board of Directors pursuant to applicable listing guidelines) who did receive the required vote shall consider the resignation offers and recommend  to the Board of Directors whether to accept them.

Advancement of Expenses; Procedures; Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings; Remedies.  In furtherance, but not in limitation of the foregoing provisions, the following procedures, presumptions and remedies shall apply with respect to advancement of expenses and the right to indemnification under this Article: 
 
 
   
 
 
 (a)            
 
Advancement of Expenses.  All reasonable expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in connection with any Proceeding shall be advanced to the Indemnitee by the corporation within 20 days after the receipt by the corporation of a statement or statements from the Indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of such Proceeding.  Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the expenses incurred by the Indemnitee and, if required by law at the time of such advance, shall include or be accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay the amounts advanced if it should ultimately be determined that the Indemnit ee is not entitled to be indemnified against such expenses pursuant to this Article. 
 
 
   
 
 
 (b)            
 
 Procedure for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification.   (i)  To obtain indemnification under this Article, an Indemnitee shall submit to the Secretary of the corporation a written request, including such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification (the "Supporting Documentation").  The determination of the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall be made not later than 60 days after receipt by the corporation of the written request for indemnification together with the Supporting Documentation.  The Secretary of the corporation shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board of Director s in writing that the Indemnitee has requested indemnification. 
 
 
   
 
 
 (ii)            
 
The Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification under this Article shall be determined in one of the following ways: (a) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), if they constitute a quorum of the Board of Directors; (b) by a written opinion on Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined) if (x) a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred and the Indemnitee so requests or (y) a quorum of the Board of Directors consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a majority of such Disinterested Directors so directs; (c) by the stockholders of the corporation (but only if a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if they constitute a quorum of the Board of Directors, presents the issue of entitlement to indemnification to the stockholders for their determination); or (d) as provided in Section 9.04(c). 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 67 
 
 
 
 
   
 
   
 
 
 
 (iii)           
 
In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 9.04(b)(ii), a majority of the Disinterested Directors shall select the Independent Counsel, but only an Independent Counsel to which the Indemnitee does not reasonably object; provided, however, that if a Change of Control shall have occurred, the Indemnitee shall select such Independent Counsel, but only an Independent Counsel to which the Board of Directors does not reasonably object. 
 
 
   
 
 
 (c)            
 
Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article, the Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this Article upon submission of a request for indemnification together with the Supporting Documentation in accordance with Section 9.04(b)(i), and thereafter the corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in reaching a contrary determination.  In any event, if the person or persons empowered under Section 9.04(b) to determine entitlement to indemnification shall not have been appointed or shall not have made a determination within 60 days after receipt by the corporation of the request therefore together with the Supporting Documentation, the Indemnitee shall be deemed to be entitled to indemnification and the Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification unless (a) the Indemnitee misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the request for indemnification or in the Supporting Documentation or (b) such indemnification is prohibited by law.  The termination of any Proceeding described in Section 9.01, or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, adversely affect the right of the Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not apposed to the best interests of the corporation or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that the Indemnitee h ad reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. 
 
 
   
 
 
 (d)            
 
 Remedies of Indemnitee.   (i)   In the event that a determination is made pursuant to Section 9.04(b) that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Article, (a) the Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek an adjudication of his entitlement to such indemnification either, at the Indemnitee's sole option, in (x) an appropriate court of the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction or (y) an arbitration to be conducted by a single arbitrator pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association; (b) any such judicial proceeding or arbitration shall be de novo and the Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of such adverse determination; and (c) in any such judicial proceeding or arbitration the corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this Article. 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 68 
 
 
 
 
   
 
   
 
 
 
 (ii)            
 
If a determination shall have been made or deemed to have been made, pursuant to Section 9.04(b) or (c), that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the corporation shall be obligated to pay the amounts constituting such indemnification within five days after such determination has been made or deemed to have been made and shall be conclusively bound by such determination unless (a) the Indemnitee misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the request for indemnification or in the Supporting Documentation or (b) such indemnification is prohibited by law.  In the event that (c) advancement of expenses is not timely made pursuant to Section 9.04(a) or (d) payment of indemnification is not made within five days after a determination of entitlement to indemnification has been made or deemed to have been made pursuant to Section 9.04(b) or (c), the Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek judicial enforcement of the corporation's obligation to pay to the Indemnitee such advancement of expenses or indemnification.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the corporation may bring an action, in an appropriate court in the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction, contesting the right of the Indemnitee to receive indemnification hereunder due to the occurrence of an event described in subclause (a) or (b) of this clause (ii)(a "disqualifying Event"); provided, however, that in any such ac tion the corporation shall have the burden of proving the occurrence of such Disqualifying Event. 
 
 
   
 
 
 (iii)            
 
The corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 9.04(d) that the procedures and presumptions of this Article are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the corporation is bound by all the provisions of this Artic le. 
 
 
   
 
 
 (iv)            
 
In the event that the Indemnitee, pursuant to this Section 9.04(d), seeks a judicial adjudication of or an award in arbitration to enforce his rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Article, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the corporation, and shall be indemnified by the corporation against, any expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him if the Indemnitee prevails in such judicial adjudication or arbitration.  If it shall be determined in such judicial adjudication or arbitration that the Indemnitee is entitled to receive part but not all of the indemnification or advancement of expenses sought, the expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such judicial adju dication or arbitration shall be prorated accordingly.
