 CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS, PREFERENCES AND RIGHTS OF THE 
 0% SERIES E CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OF 
 MABVAX THERAPEUTICS HOLDINGS, INC. 
I, J. David Hansen, hereby certify that I am the President and Chief Executive Officer of MabVax Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. (the " Company "), a corporation organized and existing under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " DGCL "), and further do hereby certify: 
That pursuant to the authority expressly conferred upon the Board of Directors of the Company (the " Board ") by the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the " Certificate of Incorporation"), the Board on March 23, 2015, adopted the following resolutions creating a series of shares of Preferred Stock designated as 0% Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, none of whi ch shares have been issued: 
RESOLVED, that the Board designates the 0% Series E Convertible Preferred Stock and the number of shares constituting such series, and fixes the rights, powers, preferences, privileges and restrictions relating to such series in addition to any set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation as follows: 
 TERMS OF SERIES E CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK 
 1.  Designation and Number of Shares. There shall hereby be created and established a series of preferred stock of the Company designated as "0% Series E Convertible Preferred Stock" (the " Preferred Shares"). The authorized number of Preferred Shares shall be 100,000 shares. Each Preferred Share shall have $0.01 par value (the " Par Value "). Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meaning as set forth in Section 23 below. 
 2.  Liquidation. Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the business of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, each holder of Preferred Shares shall be entitled to receive, for each share thereof, out of assets of the Company legally available therefor, a preferential amount in cash equal to (and not more than) the Par Value. All preferential amounts to be paid to the holders of Preferred Shares in connection with such liquidation, dissolution or winding up shall be paid before the payment or setting apart for payment of any amount for, or the distribution of any assets of the Company to the holders of (i) any other class or series of capital stock whose terms expressly provide that the holders of Preferred Shares should receive preferential payment with respect to such distribution (to the extent of such preference) and (ii) the Common Stock. If upon any such distribution the assets of the Company shall be insufficient to pay the holders of the Preferred Shares (or the holders of any class or series of capital stock ranking on a parity with the Preferred Shares as to distributions in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company) the full amounts to which they shall be entitled, such holders shall share ratably in any distribution of assets in accordance with the sums which would be payable on such distribution if all sums payable thereon were paid in full. Any distribution in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, or any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, shall be made in cash to the extent possible. Whenever any such distribution shall be paid in property other than cash, the value of such distribution shall be the fair market value of such property as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors  of the Company. 
 
 
 3.  Dividends. In addition to Sections 5(a) and 11 below, from and after the first date of issuance of any Preferred Shares (the " Initial Issuance Date "), each holder of a Preferred Share (each, a " Holder " and collectively, the " Holders ") shall be entitled to receive dividends (" Dividends") when and as declared by the Board, from time to time, in its sole discretion, which Dividends shall be paid by the Company out of funds legally available therefor, payable, subject to the conditions and other terms hereof, in cash as if such Holders had converted the Preferred Shares into Common Stock (without regard to any limitations on conversion) and had held such shares of Common Stock on the record date for such dividends and distributions. Payments under the preceding sentence shall be made concurrently with the dividend or  distribution to the holders of Common Stock. 
 4.  Conversion. Each Preferred Share shall be convertible into validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock (as defined below) on the terms and conditions set forth in th is Section 4. 
 (a)  Holder's Conversion Right. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(e), at any time or times on or after the Initial Issuance Date, each Holder shall be entitled to convert any whole number of Preferred Shares into validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 4(c) at the Conversion Rate (as defined below). 
 (b)  Conversion Rate. The number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of each Preferred Share pursuant to Section 4(a) shall be determined a ccording to the following formula (the " Conversion Rate "): 
 Base Amount 
 Conversion Price 
No fractional shares of Common Stock are to be issued upon the conversion of any Preferred Shares. If the issuance would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the Company shall round such fraction of a share of Common Stock up to the nearest whole share. 
 (c)  Mechanics of Conversion . The conversion of each Preferred Share shall be conducted in the following manner: 
 (i)  Holder's Conversion. To convert a Preferred Share into validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock on any date (a " Conversion Date"), a Holder shall deliver (whether via facsimile or otherwise), for receipt on or prior to 11:59 p.m., New York time, on such date, a copy of an executed notice of conversion of t he share(s) of Preferred Shares subject to such conversion in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit I  (the " Conversion Notice") to the Company. If required by Section 4(c)(vi), within five (5) Trading Days following a conversion of any such Preferred Shares as aforesaid, such Holder shall surrender to a nationally recognized overnight delivery service for delivery to the Company the original certificates representing the share(s) of Preferred 
   
 2 
 
 
 Shares (the " Preferred Share Certificates ") so converted as aforesaid. 
 (ii)  Company's Response . On or before the first (1 st) Trading Day following the date of receipt of a Conversion Notice, the Company shall transmit by facsimile an acknowledgment of confirmation, in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit II, of receipt of such Conversion Notice to such Holder and the Transfer Agent, which confirmation shall constitute an instruction to the Transfer Agent to process such Conversion No tice in accordance with the terms herein. On or before the second (2 nd) Trading Day following the date of receipt by the Company of such Conversion Notice, the Company shall (1) provided that the Transfer Agent is participating in DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, credit such aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled to such Holder's or its designee's balance account with DTC through its Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian system, or (2) if the Transfer Agent is not participating in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, issue and deliver (via reputable overnight courier) to the address as specified in such Conversion Notice, a certificate, registered in the name of such Holder or its designee, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled. If the number of Preferred Shares represented by the Preferred Share Certificate(s) submitted for conversion pursuant to Section 4(c)(vi) is greater than the number of Preferred Shares being converted, then the Company shall if requested by such Holder, as soon as practicable and in no event later than three (3) Trading Days after receipt of the Preferred Share Certificate(s) and at its own expense, issue and deliver to such Holder (or its designee) a new Preferred Share Certif icate representing the number of Preferred Shares not converted. 
 (iii)  Record Holder. The Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of Preferred Shares shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or hold ers of such shares of Common Stock on the Conversion Date. 
 (iv)  Company's Failure to Timely Convert. If the Company shall fail, for any reason or for no reason, to issue to a Holder within three (3) Trading Days after the Company's receipt of a Conversion Notice (whether via fac simile or otherwise) (the " Share Delivery Deadline"), a certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled and register such shares of Common Stock on the Company's share register or to credit such Holder's or its designee's balance account with DTC for such number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder's conversion of any Preferred Sha res (as the case may be) (a " Conversion Failure"), then, in addition to all other remedies available to such Holder, such Holder, upon written notice to the Company, may void its Conversion Notice with respect to, and retain or have returned (as the case may be) any Preferred Shares that have not been converted pursuant to such Holder's Conversion Notice, provided that the voiding of a Conversion Notice shall not affect the Company's obligations to make any payments which have accrued prior to the date of such notice pursuant to the 
   
 3 
 
 
terms of this Certificate of Designations or otherwise and (y) the Company shall pay in cash to such Holder on each day after such third (3 rd) Trading Day that the issuance of such shares of Common Stock is not timely effected an amount equal to 1.5% of the product of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock not issued to such Holder on a timely basis and to which the Holder is entitled and (B) the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately preceding the last possible date on which the Company could have issued such shares of Common Stock to the Holder without violating Section 4(c). In addition to the foregoing, if within three (3) Trading Days after the Company's receipt of a Conversion Notice (whether via facsimile or otherwise), the Company shall fail to issue and deliver a certificate to such Holder and register such shares of Common Stock on the Company's share register or credit such Holder's or its designee's balance account with DTC for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder's conversion hereunder (as the case may be), and if on or after such third (3 rd) Trading Day such Holder (or any other Person in respect, or on behalf, of such Holder) purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by such Holder of all or any portion of the number of shares of Common Stock, or a sale of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to all or any portion of the number of shares of Common Stock, issuable upon such conversion that such Holder so anticipated receiving from the Company, then, in addition to all other remedies available to such Holder, the Company shall, within three (3) Business Days after such Holder's request and in such Holder's discretion, either (i) pay cash to such Holder in an amount equal to such Holder's total purchase price (including brokerage commissions and other out-of-pocket expenses, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased (including, without lim itation, by any other Person in respect, or on behalf, of such Holder) (the " Buy-In Price"), at which point the Company's obligation to so issue and deliver such certificate or credit such Holder's balance account with DTC for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder's conversion hereunder (as the case may be) (and to issue such shares of Common Stock) shall terminate, or (ii) promptly honor its obligation to so issue and deliver to such Holder a certificate or certificates representing such shares of Common Stock or credit such Holder's balance account with DTC for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder's conversion hereunder (as the case may be) and pay cash to such Holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Buy-In Price over the product of (A) such number of shares of Common Stock multiplied by (B) the lowest Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on any Trading Day during the period commencing on the date of the applicable Conversion Notice and ending on the date of such issuance and payment under this clause (ii). 
 (v)  Pro Rata Conversion; Disputes. In the event the Company receives a Conversion Notice from more than one Holder for the same Conversion Date and the Company can convert some, but not all, of such Preferred Shar es submitted for conversion, the Company shall convert from each Holder electing to 
   
 4 
 
 
have Preferred Shares converted on such date a pro rata amount of such Holder's Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date based on the number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date by such Holder relative to the aggregate number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date. In the event of a dispute as to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable to a Holder in connection with a conversion of Preferred Shares, the Company shall issue to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock n ot in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 22. 
 (vi)  Book-Entry. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 4, upon conversion of any Preferred Shares in accordance with the terms hereof, no Holder thereof shall be required to physically surrender the certificate representing the Preferred Shares to the Company following conversion thereof unless (A) the full or remaining number of Preferred Shares represented by the certificate are being converted (in which event such certificate(s) shall be delivered to the Company as contemplated by this Section 4(c)(vi)) or (B) such Holder has provided the Company with prior written notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion Notice) requesting reissuance of Preferred Shares upon physical surrender of any Preferred Shares. Each Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the number of Preferred Shares so converted by such Holder and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to such Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of the certificate representing the Preferred Shares upon each such conversion. In the event of any dispute or discrepancy, such records of such Holder establishing the number of Preferred Shares to which the record holder is entitled shall be controlling and determinative in the absence of manifest error. A Holder and any transferee or assignee, by acceptance of a certificate, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of any Preferred Shares, the number of Preferred Shares represented by such certificate may be less than the number of Preferred Shares stated on the face thereof. Each certificate for Preferred Shares shall bear the following legend: 
ANY TRANSFEREE OR ASSIGNEE OF THIS CERTIFICATE SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE TERMS OF THE CORPORATION'S CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING TO THE SHARES OF SERIES E PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE, INCLUDING SECTION 4(c)(vi) THEREOF. THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF SERIES E PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE LESS THAN THE NUMBER O F SHARES OF SERIES E PREFERRED STOCK STATED ON THE FACE HEREOF PURSUANT TO SECTION 4(c)(vi) OF 
   
 5 
 
 
THE CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING TO THE SHARES OF SERIES E PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE. 
 (d)  Taxes. The Company shall pay any and all documentary, stamp, transfer (but only in respect of the registered holder thereof), issuance and other similar taxes that may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of Preferred Shares. 
 (e)  Limitation on Beneficial Ownership. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Certificate of Designations, the Preferred Shares held by a Holder shall not be convertible by such Holder, and the Company shall not effect any conversion of any Preferred Shares held by such Holder, to the extent (but only to the extent) that such Holder or any of its affiliates would beneficiall y own in excess of 4.99% (the " Maximum Percentage") of the Common Stock. To the extent the above limitation applies, the determination of whether the Preferred Shares held by such Holder shall be convertible (vis-Ã -vis other convertible, exercisable or exchangeable securities owned by such Holder or any of its affiliates) and of which such securities shall be convertible, exercisable or exchangeable (as among all such securities owned by such Holder and its affiliates) shall, subject to such Maximum Percentage limitation, be determined on the basis of the first submission to the Company for conversion, exercise or exchange (as the case may be). No prior inability of a Holder to convert Preferred Shares, or of the Company to issue shares of Common Stock to such Holder, pursuant to this Section 4(e) shall have any effect on the applicability of the provisions of this Section 4(e) with respect to any subsequent determination of convertibility or issuance (as the case may be). For purposes of this Section 4(e), beneficial ownership and all determinations and calculations (including, without limitation, with respect to calculations of percentage ownership) shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The provisions of this Section 4(e) shall be implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 4(e) to correct this Section 4(e) (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Maximum Percentage beneficial ownership limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such Maximum Percentage limitation. The limitations contained in this Section 4(e) shall apply to a successor holder of Preferred Shares. The holders of Common Stock shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 4(e) and the Company may not waive this Section 4(e). For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within two (2) Business Days confirm orally and in writing to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding, including by virtue of any prior conversion or exercise of convertible or exercisable securities into Common Stock, including, without limitation, pursuant to this Certificate of Designations or securities issued pursuant to the Exchange Agreements. By written notice to the Company, any Holder may increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such increase will not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to 
   
 6 
 
 
the Company, and (ii) any such increase or decrease will apply only to such Holder sending such notice and not to any other Holder. 
 5.  Rights Upon Issuance of Purchase Rights and Other Corporate Events . 
 (a)  Purchase Rights. In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 7 below, if at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to all of the record holders of any class of Common Stock (the " Purchase Rights"), then each Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder could have acquired if such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of all the Preferred Shares (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Preferred Shares) held by such Holder immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights (provided, however, to the extent that such Holder's right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in such Holder exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (or beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held in abeyance for such Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in such Holder exceeding the Maximum Percentage). 
 (b)  Other Corporate Events. In addition to and not in substitution for any other rights hereunder, prior to the consummation of any Fundamental Transaction pursuant to which holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect to or in exchange for shares of Common Stock (a " Corporate Event"), the Company shall make appropriate provision to insure that each Holder will thereafter have the right to receive upon a conversion of all the Preferred Shares held by such Holder (i) in addition to the shares of Common Stock receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets to which such Holder would have been entitled with respect to such shares of Common Stock had such shares of Common Stock been held by such Holder upon the consummation of such Corporate Event (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Preferred Shares contained in this Certificate of Designations) or (ii) in lieu of the shares of Common Stock otherwise receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets received by the holders of shares of Common Stock in connection with the consummation of such Corporate Event in such amounts as such Holder would have been entitled to receive had the Preferred Shares held by such Holder initially been issued with conversion rights for the form of such consideration (as opposed to shares of Common Stock) at a conversion rate for such consideration commensurate with the Conversion Rate. The provisions of this Section 5(b) shall apply similarly and equally to successive Corporate Events and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion of the Preferred Shares contained in this Certificate of Designations. 
   
 7 
 
 
 6.  Rights Upon Fundamental Transactions. Upon the occurrence of any Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents referring to the "Company" shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Company herein and therein. In addition to the foregoing, upon consummation of a Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall deliver to each Holder confirmation that there shall be issued upon conversion of the Preferred Shares at any time after the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction, in lieu of the shares of Common Stock (or other securities, cash, assets or other property (except such items still issuable under Sections 5 and 11, which shall continue to be receivable thereafter)) issuable upon the conversion of the Preferred Shares prior to such Fundamental Transaction, such shares of the Successor Entity (including its Parent Entity) or other consideration which each Holder would have been entitled to receive upon the happening of such Fundamental Transaction had all the Preferred Shares held by each Holder been converted immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitations on the conversion of the Preferred Shares contained in this Certificate of Designations), as adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this Certificate of Designations. The provisions of this Section 6 shall apply similarly and equally to successive Fundamental Transactions and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion of the Preferred Shares. 
 7.  Rights Upon Issuance of Other Securities . 
(a) Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Issuance of Common Stock. If and whenever for a period beginning on the Initial Issuance Date and ending on the earlier of (i) twenty-four (24) months from the Final Closing Date (as defined in the Subscription Agreement), (ii) the date the Company consummates a financing (excluding proceeds from the sale of the Preferred Shares) in which the Company receives gross proceeds of at least Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) and (iii) the date the Company's Common Stock is listed for trading on a national securities exchange (which, for purposes hereof shall mean The New York Stock Exchange, the NYSE MKT, the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the Nasdaq Global Market or the Nadsaq Capital Market), the Company issues or sells, or in accordance with this Section 7(a) is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock (including the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock owned or held by or for the account of the Company, but excluding any Excluded Securities issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold) for a consid eration per share (the " New Issuance Price") less than a price equal to the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale (such Conversion Price then in effect is referred  to as the " Applicable Price ") (the foregoing a " Dilutive Issuance"), then, immediately after such Dilutive Issuance the Conversion Price then in effect shall be reduced to the New Issuance Price. For all purposes of the foregoing (including, without limitation, determining the adjusted Conversion Price and the New Issuance Price under this Section 7(a)), the following shall be applicable 
   
 8 
 
 
 (i)  Issuance of Options. If the Company in any manner grants or sells any Options and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the granting or sale of such Option for such price per share. For purposes of this Section 7(a)(i), the "lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such Options or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option" shall be equal to (1) the lower of (x) the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the granting or sale of such Option, upon exercise of such Option and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such Option and (y) the lowest exercise price set forth in such Option for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such Options or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option minus (2) the sum of all amounts paid or payable to the holder of such Option (or any other Person) upon the granting or sale of such Option, upon exercise of such Option and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such Option plus the value of any other consideration received or receivable by, or benefit conferred on, the holder of such Option (or any other Person). Except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such share of Common Stock or of such Convertible Securities upon the exercise of such Options or upon the actual issuance of such share of Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities. 
 (ii)  Issuance of Convertible Securities. If the Company in any manner issues or sells any Convertible Securities and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the conversion, exercise or exchange thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the issuance or sale of such Convertible Securities for such price per share. For purposes of this Section 7(a)(ii), the "lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the conversion, exercise or exchange thereof" shall be equal to (1) the lower of (x) the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to one share of Common Stock upon the issuance or sale of the Convertible Security and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Security and (y) the lowest conversion price set forth in such Convertible Security for which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange thereof minus (2) the sum of all amounts paid or payable to the holder of such Convertible Security (or any other Person) upon the issuance or sale of such Convertible Security plus the va lue of any other 
   
 9 
 
 
consideration received or receivable by, or benefit conferred on, the holder of such Convertible Security (or any other Person). Except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such share of Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities, and if any such issue or sale of such Convertible Securities is made upon exercise of any Options for which adjustment of the Conversion Price has been or is to be made pursuant to other provisions of this Section 7(a), except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made by reason of such issue or sale. 
 (iii)  Change in Option Price or Rate of Conversion. If the purchase or exercise price provided for in any Options, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issue, conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities, or the rate at which any Convertible Securities are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock increases or decreases at any time, the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such increase or decrease shall be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been in effect at such time had such Options or Convertible Securities provided for such increased or decreased purchase price, additional consideration or increased or decreased conversion rate (as the case may be) at the time initially granted, issued or sold. For purposes of this Section 7(a)(iii), if the terms of any Option or Convertible Security that was outstanding as of the Initial Issuance Date are increased or decreased in the manner described in the immediately preceding sentence, then such Option or Convertible Security and the shares of Common Stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such increase or decrease. No adjustment pursuant to this Section 7(a) shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the Conversion Price then in effect above what it was prior to the original adjustment prior before giving effect to any such increase  or decrease. 
 (iv)  Calculation of Consideration Received. If any Option or Convertible Security is issued in connection with the issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any other Option or Convertible Security), together comprising one integrated transaction, (x) such Option or Convertible Security (as applicable) will be deemed to have been issued for consideration equal to the fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by the Company's Board of Directors and (y) the other securities issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold in such integrated transaction shall be deemed to have been issued for consideration equal to the difference of (I) the aggregate consideration received by the Company minus (II) the aggregate fair market value of all such Options and/or Convertible Securities (as applicable) so issued. If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor will be deemed to be the net amount of consideration received by the Company therefor. If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold for a consideration 
   
 10 
 
 
other than cash, the amount of such consideration received by the Company will be the fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of publicly traded securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by the Company for such securities will be the arithmetic average of the VWAPs of such security for each of the five (5) Trading Days immediately preceding the date of receipt. If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the Company is the surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to such shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, as the case may be. The fair value of any consideration other than cash or publicly traded securities will be determined jointly by the Company and the holders of at least 60% of the outstanding Preferred Shares (the " Required Holders"). If such parties are unable to reach agreement within ten (10) days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the " Valuation Event"), the fair value of such consideration will be determined within five (5) Trading Days after the tenth (10 th) day following such Valuation Event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the Company and the Required Holders. The determination of such appraiser shall be final and binding upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the Company. 
 (v)  Record Date. If the Company takes a record of the holders of shares of Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (A) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common Stock, Options or in Convertible Securities or (B) to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date of the issue or sale of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution o r the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase (as the case may be). 
(b) Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock. Without limiting any provision of Sections 5 and 11, if the Company at any time on or after the Initial Issuance Date subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. Without limiting any provision of Sections 5 and 11, if the Company at any time on or after the Initial Issuance Date combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be proportionately increased. Any adjustment pursuant to this Section 7(b) shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such subdivision or combination. If any event requiring an adjustment under this Section 7(b) occurs during the perio d that a 
   
 11 
 
 
Conversion Price is calculated hereunder, then the calculation of such Conversion Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect such event. 
(c) Other Events. In the event that the Company (or any Subsidiary) shall take any action to which the provisions hereof are not strictly applicable, or, if applicable, would not operate to protect any Holder from dilution or if any event occurs of the type contemplated by the provisions of this Section 7 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then the Board shall in good faith determine and implement an appropriate adjustment in the Conversion Price so as to protect the rights of such Holder, provided that no such adjustment pursuant to this Section 7(c) will increase the Conversion Price as otherwise determined pursuant to this Section 7, provided further that if such Holder does not accept such adjustments as appropriately protecting its interests hereunder against such dilution, then the Board and such Holder shall agree, in good faith, upon an independent investment bank of nationally recognized standing to make such appropriate adjustments, whose determination shall be final and binding and whose fees and expenses shall be borne by the Company. 
(d) Calculations. All calculations under this Section 7 shall be made by rounding to the nearest one-hundred thousandth of a cent or the nearest 1/100 th of a share, as applicable. The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or held by or for the account of the Company, and the  disposition of any such shares shall be considered an issue or sale of Common Stock. 
 8.  Authorized Shares . 
 (a)  Reservation. The Company shall initially reserve out of its authorized and unissued Common Stock a number of shares of Common Stock equal to 125% of the Conversion Rate with respect to the Base Amount of each Preferred Share as of the Initial Issuance Date (assuming for purposes hereof, that all the Preferred Shares issuable pursuant to the Subscription Agreement have been issued, such Preferred Shares are convertible at the Conversion Price and without taking into account any limitations on the conversion of such Preferred Shares set forth in herein) issuable pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of Designations from the Initial Issuance Date through the second anniversary of the Initial Issuance Date assuming (assuming for purposes hereof, that all the Preferred Shares issuable pursuant to the Subscription Agreement have been issued and without taking into account any limitations on the issuance of securities set forth herein). So long as any of the Preferred Shares are outstanding, the Company shall take all action necessary to reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Shares, as of any given date, 125% of the number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion of all of the Preferred Shares issued or issuable pursuant to the Subscription Agreement assuming for purposes hereof, that all the Preferred Shares issuable pursuant to the Subscription Agreement have been issued and without taking into account any limitations on the issuance of secur ities set forth herein), provided that at no time shall the number of shares of Common Stock so 
   
 12 
 
 
available be less than the number of shares required to be reserved by the previous sentence (without regard to any limitations on conversions contained in this Certificate of Desi gnations) (the " Required Amount"). The initial number of shares of Common Stock reserved for conversions of the Preferred Shares and each increase in the number of shares so reserved shall be allocated pro rata among the Holders based on the number of Preferred Shares held by each Holder on the Initial Issuance Date or increase in the number of reserved shares (as the case may be) (the " Authorized Share Allocation"). In the event a Holder shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such Holder's Preferred Shares, each transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such Holder's Authorized Share Allocation. Any shares of Common Stock reserved and allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any Preferred Shares shall be allocated to the remaining Holders of Preferred  Shares, pro rata based on the number of Preferred Shares then held by such Holders. 
 (b)  Insufficient Authorized Shares. If, notwithstanding Section 8(a) and not in limitation thereof, at any time while any of the Preferred Shares remain outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock to satisfy its obligation to have available for issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Shares at least a number of shares of Commo n Stock equal to the Required Amount (an " Authorized Share Failure"), then the Company shall promptly take all action necessary to increase the Company's authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to reserve and have available the Required Amount for all of the Preferred Shares then outstanding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an Authorized Share Failure, but in no event later than ninety (90) days after the occurrence of such Authorized Share Failure, the Company shall hold a meeting of its stockholders or conduct a consent solicitation for the approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock. In connection with such meeting, the Company shall provide each stockholder with a proxy statement and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit its stockholders' approval of such increase in authorized shares of Common Stock and to cause its Board to recommend to the stockholders that they approve such proposal. Nothing contained in this Section 8 shall limit any obligations of the Company under any provision of the Subscription Agreement. In the event that the Company is prohibited from issuing shares of Common Stock upon a conversion of any Preferred Share due to the failure by the Company to have sufficient shares of Common Stock available out of the authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock (such unavailable number of sha res of Common Stock, the " Authorization Failure Shares"), in lieu of delivering such Authorization Failure Shares to such Holder of such Preferred Shares, the Company shall pay cash in exchange for the cancellation of such Preferred Shares convertible into such Authorized Failure Shares at a price equal to the sum of (i) the product of (x) such number of Authorization Failure Shares and (y) the Closing Sale Price on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date such Holder delivers the applicable Conversion Notice with respect to such Authorization Failure Shares to the Company and (ii) to the extent such Holder purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by such Holder of Authorization Failur e Shares, any brokerage commissions and other out- 
   
 13 
 
 
 of-pocket expenses, if any, of such Holder incurred in connection therewith. 
 9.  Voting Rights. Except as otherwise expressly required by law, each Holder shall be entitled to vote on all matters submitted to shareholders of the Company and shall be entitled to the number of votes for its Preferred Shares owned at the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote on such matter or, if no such record date is established, at the date such vote is taken or any written consent of shareholders is solicited, equal to the number of shares of Conversion Shares, but not in excess of the conversion limitations set forth in Section 4(e) herein. Except as otherwise required by law, the Holders of the Preferred Shares shall vote together with the holders of Common Stock on all matters and shall  not vote as a separate class. 
 10.  Intentionally Omitted . 
 11.  Participation. In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 7(b), the Holders shall, as holders of Preferred Shares, be entitled to receive such dividends paid and distributions made to the holders of shares of Common Stock to the same extent as if such Holders had converted each Preferred Share held by each of them into shares of Common Stock (without regard to any limitations on conversion herein or elsewhere) and had held such shares of Common Stock on the record date for such dividends and distributions. Payments under the preceding sentence shall be made concurrently with the dividend or distribution to the holders of shares of Common Stock (provided, however, to the extent that a Holder's right to participate in any such dividend or distribution would result in such Holder exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such dividend or distribution to such extent (or the beneficial ownership of any such shares of Common Stock as a result of such dividend or distribution to such extent) and such dividend or distribution to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of such Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in such Holder exceeding the Maximum Percentag e). 
 12.  Vote to Change the Terms of or Issue Preferred Shares. In addition to any other rights provided by law, except where the vote or written consent of the holders of a greater number of shares is required by law or by another provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, without first obtaining the affirmative vote at a meeting duly called for such purpose or the written consent without a meeting of the Required Holders, voting together as a single class, the Company shall not: (a) amend or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, its Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws, or file any certificate of designations or articles of amendment of any series of shares of preferred stock, if such action would adversely alter or change in any respect the preferences, rights, privileges or powers, or restrictions provided for the benefit, of the Preferred Shares, regardless of whether any such action shall be by means of amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation or by merger, consolidation or otherwise; (b) increase or decrease (other than by conversion) the authorized number of Preferred Shares; (c) issue any Preferred Shares other than pursuant to the Subscription Agreement; or (d) without limiting any provision of Section 16, whether or not prohibited by the terms of the Preferred Shares,  circumvent a right of the Preferred Shares. 
   
 14 
 
 
 13.  Intentionally Omitted . 
 14.  Lost or Stolen Certificates. Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any certificates representing Preferred Shares (as to which a written certification and the indemnification contemplated below shall suffice as such evidence), and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of an indemnification undertaking by the applicable Holder to the Company in customary and reasonable form and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of the certificate(s), the Comp any shall execute and deliver new certificate(s) of like tenor and date. 
 15.  Remedies, Characterizations, Other Obligations, Breaches and Injunctive Relief. The remedies provided in this Certificate of Designations shall be cumulative and in addition to all other remedies available under this Certificate of Designations and any of the other Transaction Documents, at law or in equity (including a decree of specific performance and/or other injunctive relief), and no remedy contained herein shall be deemed a waiver of compliance with the provisions giving rise to such remedy. Nothing herein shall limit any Holder's right to pursue actual and consequential damages for any failure by the Company to comply with the terms of this Certificate of Designations. The Company covenants to each Holder that there shall be no characterization concerning this instrument other than as expressly provided herein. Amounts set forth or provided for herein with respect to payments, conversion and the like (and the computation thereof) shall be the amounts to be received by a Holder and shall not, except as expressly provided herein, be subject to any other obligation of the Company (or the performance thereof). The Company acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to the Holders and that the remedy at law for any such breach may be inadequate. The Company therefore agrees that, in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, each Holder shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies, to an injunction restraining any such breach or any such threatened breach, without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required. The Company shall provide all information and documentation to a Holder that is requested by such Holder to enable such Holder to confirm the Company's compliance with the terms and conditions of this Certificate of Desig nations. 
 16.  Noncircumvention. The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation, bylaws or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Certificate of Designations, and will at all times in good faith carry out all the provisions of this Certificate of Designations and take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the Holders. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or any other provision of this Certificate of Designations, the Company (i) shall not increase the par value of any shares of Common Stock receivable upon the conversion of any Preferred Shares above the Conversion Price then in effect, (ii) shall take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of Preferred Shares and (iii) shall, so long as any Preferred Shares are outstanding, take all action necessary to reserve 
   
 15 
 
 
and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Shares, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion of the Preferred Shares then outstanding (without regard to any limitations on conversion contai ned herein). 
 17.  Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver. No failure or delay on the part of a Holder in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privilege. No waiver shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. This Certificate of Designations shall be deemed to be jointly drafted by the Company and all Holders and shall not b e construed against any Person as the drafter hereof. 
 18.  Notices. The Company shall provide each Holder of Preferred Shares with prompt written notice of all actions taken pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of Designations, including in reasonable detail a description of such action and the reason therefor. Whenever notice is required to be given under this Certificate of Designations, unless otherwise provided herein, such notice must be in writing and shall be given in accordance with Section 8(e) of the Subscription Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company shall give written notice to each Holder (i) promptly following any adjustment of the Conversion Price, setting forth in reasonable detail, and certifying, the calculation of such adjustment and (ii) at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date on which the Company closes its books or takes a record (A) with respect to any dividend or distribution upon the Common Stock, (B) with respect to any grant, issuances, or sales of any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property to all holders of shares of Common Stock as a class or (C) for determining rights to vote with respect to any Fundamental Transaction, dissolution or liquidation, provided, in each case, that such information shall be made known to the public prior to, or simultaneously with, such notice being provided to any Holder.
