 QUALITY DISTRIBUTION, INC. 
 (as amended December 23, 2014) 
 ARTICLE I. 
 Offices 
SECTION A. PRINCIPAL OFFICE. The principal office of the corporation shall be in Tampa, County of Hillsborough, and State of Florida. 
SECTION B. OTHER OFFICES. The corporation may also have offices at such other places both within and without the State of Florida as the Board of Directors may from time to time de termine or the business of the corporation may require. 
 ARTICLE II. 
 Shareholders 
SECTION A. ANNUAL MEETING. A meeting of the shareholders shall be held annually, within six months of the end of each fiscal year of the corporation, for the purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of such other proper business as may come before the meeting, the exact date to be established by the Board of Directors from time to time. 
SECTION B. SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of the shareholders may be called at any time, for any purpose or purposes, but only by (a) the Chief Executive Officer, (b) a majority of the directors in office, although less than a quorum, and (c) the holders of at least fifty percent (50%) of the total number of votes of the then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at such special meeting (provided such holders sign, date and deliver to the corporation's Secretary one or more written demands for a special meeting, describing the purpose(s) for which it is to be held). Notice and call of any such special meeting shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting, and business transacted at any special meeting of the shareholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice thereof. 
SECTION C. PLACE OF MEETING. The Board of Directors may designate any place, either within or without the State of Florida, as the place of meeting for any annual or special meeting of the shareholders. A waiver of notice signed by all shareholders entitled to vote at a meeting may designate any place, either within or without the State of Florida, as the place for the holding of such meeting. If no designation is made, the place of meeting shall be the principal office of the corporation in the State of Florida. 
SECTION D. NOTICE OF MEETING. Written notice stating the place, day and hour of an annual or special meeting and the purpose or purposes for which it is called shall be delivered not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each shareholder entitled to vote at such meeting, except that no notice of a meeting need be given to any shareholder for which notice is not required to be given under applicable law. Notice may be delivered personally, via first-class United States mail, telegraph, teletype, facsimile or other electronic transmission, or by private mail carriers handling nationwide mail services, by or at the direction of the President, the Secretary, the Board of Directors, or the person(s) calling the meeting. If mailed via first-class United States mail, addressed to the shareholder at the shareholder's address as it appears on the stock  transfer books of the corporation, with postage thereon prepaid. 
SECTION E. NOTICE OF ADJOURNED MEETING. If an annual or special shareholders' meeting is adjourned to a different date, time, or place, notice need not be given of the new date, time or place if the new date, time or place is announced at the meeting before an adjournment is taken, and any business may be transacted at the 
   
 - 1 - 
 
 
adjourned meeting that might have been transacted on the original date of the meeting. If, however, a new record date for the adjourned meeting is or must be fixed under law, notice of the adjourned meeting must be given to persons who are shareholders as of the new record date of who are otherwise entitled to notice of such meeting. 
SECTION F. WAIVER OF CALL AND NOTICE OF MEETING. Call and notice of any shareholders' meeting may be waived by any shareholder before or after the date and time stated in the notice. Such waiver must be in writing signed by the shareholder and delivered to the corporation. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any special or annual meeting need be specified in such waiver. A shareholder's attendance at a meeting (a) waives such shareholder's ability to object to lack of notice or defective notice of the meeting, unless the shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting; and (b) waives such shareholder's ability to object to consideration of a particular matter at the meeting that is not within the purpose or purposes described in the meeting notice, unless the shareholder objects to considering the m atter when it is presented. 
SECTION G. QUORUM. Except as otherwise provided in these by-laws, the Articles of Incorporation, or by law a majority of the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of the shareholders. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting, unless a new record date is or must be set for an adjourned meeting, and the withdrawal of shareholders after a quorum has been established at a meeting shall not effect the validity of any action taken at the meeting or any adjournment thereof. 
SECTION H. ADJOURNMENT; QUORUM FOR ADJOURNED MEETING. If less than a majority of the outstanding shares is represented at a meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting without further notice. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented or deemed to be present or represented, any business may be tra nsacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. 
SECTION I. VOTING ON MATTERS OTHER THAN ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. At any meeting at which a quorum is present, action on any matter other than the election of directors shall be approved if the votes cast by the holders of shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless a greater number of affirmative votes or voting by classes is required by these by-laws, the Articles of Incorporation or by law. 
SECTION J. VOTING FOR DIRECTORS. Directors shall be elected as hereinafter set forth. Each shareholder who is entitled to vote at an election of directors has the right to vote the number of shares owned by him or her for as many persons as there are directors to be elected. Shareholders do not have a right to cumulate their votes for directors. 
Except as provided with respect to Contested Elections, each nominee shall be elected a director by a Majority Vote with respect to that nominee's election at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. For purposes of these by-laws, a "Majority Vote" means that the number of votes cast in favor of a nominee must exceed the number of votes cast against that nominee's election. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will not count as a vote cast with respect to that nominee. 
Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in any Contested Election. For purposes of these by-laws, a "Contested Election" means an election of directors with respect to which, as of ten (10) days prior to the date the Corporation first mails the notice of such meeting to shareholders, there are more nominees for election than positions on  the Board of Directors to be filled by election at the meeting. 
Except with regard to Contested Elections, each nominee for election as a director shall provide to the Corporation, prior to the distribution of the proxy statement relating to such meeting, a contingent letter of resignation from the Board of Directors which shall become effective only if the director fails to receive a sufficient number of votes for re-election at the annual meeting of shareholders and the Board of Directors determines to accept the resignation.

SECTION K. VOTING LISTS. At least ten (10) days prior to each meeting of shareholders, the officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer books for shares of the corporation shall make or cause to be made a complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting, or any adjournment thereof, with the address and the number, class and series (if any) of shares held by each, which list shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder during normal business hours for at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting. The list also shall be available at the meeting and shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder at any time during the meeting or its adjournment. The shareholders list shall be prima facie evidence as to who are the shareholders entitled to examine such list or the transfer books or to vote at any meeting of the shareholders. 
SECTION L. VOTING OF SHARES. Each shareholder entitled to vote shall be entitled at every meeting of the shareholders to one vote in person or by proxy on each matter for each share of voting stock held by such shareholder. Such right to vote shall be subject to the right of the Board of Directors for voting shareholders as here after provided. 
SECTION M. PROXIES. At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder may vote by proxy, executed in writing and delivered to the corporation in the original or transmitted via telegram, or as a photographic, photostatic or equivalent reproduction of a written proxy by the shareholder or by the shareholder's duly authorized attorney-in-fact; but, no proxy shall be valid after eleven (11) months from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. Each proxy shall be filed with the Secretary of the corporation before or at the time of the meeting. In the event that a proxy shall designate two or more persons to act as proxies, a majority of such persons present at the meeting, or, if only one is present, that one, shall have all of the powers conferred by the proxy upon all the persons so designated, unless the instrument shall provide otherwise. 
SECTION N. INFORMAL ACTION BY SHAREHOLDERS. Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote if one or more consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by shareholders holding shares representing not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. No written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the date of the earliest dated consent delivered to the Secretary, written consent signed by the number of shareholders required to take action is delivered to the Secretary. If authorization of an action is obtained by one or more written consent but less than all shareholders so consent, then within ten (10) days after obtaining the authorization of such action by written consents, notice must be given to each shareholder who did not consent in writing and to each shareholder who is not entitled to vote on the action. 
SECTION O. PRESIDING OFFICER AND SECRETARY. At every meeting of the shareholders, the President, or in his absence the Chairman of the Board, or in his absence an individual appointed by the Board of Directors, shall act as the presiding officer of the meeting. The Secretary, or in his absence an Assistant Secretary, shall act as the secretary for the meetin g. 
SECTION P. INSPECTORS. For each meeting of the shareholders, the Board of Directors or the President may appoint two inspectors to supervise the voting; and, if inspectors are so appointed, questions respecting the qualification of any vote, the validity of any proxy, and the acceptance or action of any vote shall be decided by such inspectors. Before acting at any meeting, the inspectors shall take an oath to execute their duties with strict impartiality and according to the best of their ability. If any inspector shall fail to be present or shall decline to act, the presiding officer shall appoint another inspector to act in his place. In case of a tie vote by the inspectors on any question, the presiding off icer shall decide the issue. 
SECTION Q. BUSINESS AT ANNUAL MEETING. At any annual meeting of shareholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been (i) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or to the direction of the Board of Directors, or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by a shareholder who is a shareholder of record at the time of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section Q  of this Article II and who shall be entitled to vote at such meeting. 
   
 - 3 - 
 
 
In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that less than ninety (90) days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be received not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made, whichever first occurs. A shareholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting, (ii) the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, (iii) the name and record address of the shareholder proposing such business, (iv) the class or series and number of shares of the Corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by the shareholder, (v) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the shareholder and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business by the shareholder and any material interest of the shareholder in such business, (vi) the same information required by clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) above with respect to any other shareholder that, to the knowledge of the shareholder proposing such business, supports such proposal, and (vii) a representation that the shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business b efore the meeting. 
Notwithstanding anything in this Section Q of this Article II to the contrary, a shareholder intending to nominate one or more persons for election as a director at an annual meeting must comply with Section K of Article III of these by-laws for such nominations to be properly brought before such meeting. 
No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of shareholders except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section Q  of this Article II . The Chairman or other officer of the Corporation presiding at the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine that business was not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section Q of this Article II, and if he or she should so determine, shall so declare to the meeting and any such business not properly brou ght before the meeting shall not be transacted. 
 ARTICLE III.

The termination of any such action, suit or other proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner that such person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person's conduct was unlawful.
