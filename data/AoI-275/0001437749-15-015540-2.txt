I                              (i)      such shares of Common Stock are sold by such holder in a public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement filed by the Corpor ation under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " 1933 Act"), provided that the number of shares of Class B Common Stock so converted does not exceed the number of shares of Common Stock actually sold by such holder pursuant to such regis tration statement; or 
   
 
   
 2

b.     Each conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock into Common Stock shall be effected by the surrender of the certificate or certificates representing shares of Class B Common Stock to be converted at the principal office of the Corporation (or such other office or agency of the Corporation as the Corporation may designate by notice in writing to the holder or holders of Class B Common Stock) at any time during its usual business hours, which notice shall also state the name or names (with addresses) and denominations in which the certificate or certificates for Common Stock shall be issued and shall include instructions for delivery thereof. Such stock certificate and notice shall be accompanied by, if  the conversion is made pursuant to  clause (ii)  of  subparagraph a, an executed copy of the notice on Form 144 required to be filed by such holder with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Promptly after such surrender and the receipt of such written notice, the Corporation shall issue and deliver in accordance with such instructions the certificate or certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion. To the extent permitted by law, such conversion shall be deemed to have been effected as of the close of business on the date on which such certificate or certificates shall have been  surrendered and such notice, if required hereunder, shall have been received. 
   
c.     The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares or in treasury a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock as may be required, solely for the purpose of issue upon the conversion of outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock as provided in this  paragraph 4. The Corporation covenants that all shares of Common Stock which shall be so issuable shall, when issued, be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, free of any preemptive rights. The Corporation will use reasonable efforts to take all such action as may be necessary to assure that all such shares of Common Stock may be so issued without violation of any applicable law or regulation or any requirements of any domestic stock exchange upon which shares of Common Stock may be listed. 
   
d. The issuance of certificates for shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock shall be made without charge to the holders of such shares of Class B Common Stock for any issuance tax in respect thereof, or other cost incurred by the Corporation in connection with such conversion and the related issuance of shares of Common Stock, provided that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any such tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any certificate in a name other than that of the holder of the Class B Common Stock converted. The Corporation will not take any action which would cause the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Class B Common Stock then outstanding, together with the total number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding and the total number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Stock or for any other purpose, to exceed the total number of shares of Common Stock then authorized by the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation. The Corporation will not take any action which has the purpose or effect of delaying or hindering the timely transfer or conversion of any share of Class B Common Stock or of any share of Common Stock issued or issuable upon the conversion of such shares.

The undersigned, being the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. (the "Corporation"), pursuant to Section 242 of the General Corporation Law  of the State of Delaware, do hereby certify that: 
   
 FIRST: The Board of Directors of the Corporation has duly adopted, subject to approval by the Corporation's stockholders, resolutions to further amend Article SIXTH of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation to declassify the Board of Directors, remove the class designations for each of the director's terms and institute annual voting for all directors, who will serve a one year term (the "Declassification Amendment"). The Board of Directors of the Corporation duly adopted the Declassification Amendment on October 15, 2013 and submitted it to the Corporation's stockholders for consideration at the Corporation's Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on December 4, 2013 (the "2013 Annual Meeting"). T he resolution setting forth the Declassification Amendment is a follows: 
   
 RESOLVED, that the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation shall be further amended by deleting the current Article SIXTH thereof in its entirety and substitut ing in lieu thereof the following: 
   
 "SIXTH: 
   
 1.  Directors. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of a Board of Directors consisting of not more than nine directors, the exact number of members to be fixed from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors, except as may be provided by the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors in respect of Preferred Stock adopted pursuant to Article FOURTH hereof. Beginning with the first annual meeting of stockholders held after the date of this amendment, the entire Board of Directors shall be elected annually at each annual meeting of stockholders for a one year term expiring at the next succeeding annual meeting of stockholders. The directors shall hold office until their respective successors are elected and shall qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation or removal from office. 
   
 2.  No Written Ballot. Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the bylaws of the Corporation so provide. 
   
 3.  Vacancies. Vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, removal or otherwise and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors may be filled solely by a majority of the directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director. 
   
 4.  Removal. No director may be removed from office by the stockholders except for cause with the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding shares of stock  generally entitled to vote. 
   
 5.  Preferred Stock Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of one or more classes or series of Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately as a class or series, to elect directors, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies, removal and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to ARTICLE FOURTH applicable thereto, and each director so elected shall not be subject to the provisions of this ARTICLE SIXTH unless otherwise  provided therein."
