(B) such acquisition of beneficial ownership by such Person, either alone or together with its Related Persons, will not impair the SEC's ability to enforce the Act. In making such determinations under clauses (A) and (B) of this Section (b)(ii), the Board may impose such conditions and restrictions on such Person and its Related Persons owning any shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on any matter as the Board may in its sole discretion deem necessary, appropriate or desirable in furtherance of the objectives of the Ac t and the governance of the Corporation; 
(C) neither such Person nor any of its Related Persons is subject to any statutory disqualification (as defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Act); and

From and after the redemption date (unless the Corporation shall default in providing funds for the payment of the redemption price), the shares of Redeemed Stock which have been redeemed as aforesaid shall become treasury shares and shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and all rights of the holder of such Redeemed Stock as a stockholder of the Corporation (except the right to receive from the Corporation the redemption price against  delivery to the Corporation of evidence of ownership of such shares) shall cease. 
 (ii)       If and to the extent that shares of stock of the Corporation beneficially owned by any Person or its Related Persons are held of record by any other Person, this Article Sixth shall be enforced against such record owner by requiring the redemption of shares of stock of the Corporation held by such record owner in accordance with this Article Sixth, in a mann er that will accomplish the Ownership Limitation applicable to such Person and its Related Persons. 
 (d)      Right to Information.  The Corporation shall have the right to require any Person and its Related Persons that the Board reasonably believes (x) to be subject to the limitations contained in Section (a) of this Article Sixth, (y) to beneficially own shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on any matter in excess of the Ownership Limitation, or (z) to beneficially own an aggregate of 5% or more of the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on any matter, which ownership such Person, either alone or together with its Related Persons, has not reported to the Corporation, to provide to the Corporation, upon the Corporation's request, complete information as to all shares of stock of the Corporation beneficially owned by such Person and its Related Persons and any other factual matter relating to the applicability or effect of this Article Sixth as may reasonably be requested of such Person and its Related Persons.

 7

 (c)     If a claim for indemnification (following the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding) or advancement of expenses under this Article Tenth is not paid in full within thirty days after a written claim therefor by the Covered Person has been received by the Corporation, the Covered Person may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim to the fullest extent permitted by law. In any action the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the Covered Person is not entitled to the requested indemnification or advancement of expenses under applicable law. 
 (d)     The provisions of this Article Tenth shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each Covered Person who serves in any such capacity at any time while this Article Tenth is in effect, and any repeal or modification of any applicable law or of this Article Tenth shall not affect any rights or obligations then existing with respect to any state of facts then or theretofore existing or any action, suit or proceeding theretofore or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts. 
 (e)     Persons not expressly covered by the foregoing provisions of this Article Tenth, such as those (x) who are or were employees or agents of the Corporation, or are or were serving at the request of the Corporation as employees or agents of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (y) who are or were directors, officers, employees or agents of a constituent corporation absorbed in a consolidation or merger in which the Corporation was the resulting or surviving corporation, or who are or were serving at the request of such constituent corporation as directors, officers, employees or agents of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, may be indemnified or advanced expenses to the extent authorized at any time or from time to time by the Board. 
 (f)     The rights conferred on any Covered Person by this Article Tenth shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which such Covered Person may be entitled by law or otherwise, and shall continue as to a Person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such Per son. 
 (g)     The Corporation's obligation, if any, to indemnify or to advance expenses to any Covered Person who was or is serving at its request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or non-profit entity shall be reduced by any amount such Covered Person may collect as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or non-profit entity. 
 (h)     Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article Tenth shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any Covered Person in respect of any ac t or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification. 
 (i)     The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, manager, officer, trustee, employee or agent of the Corporation or another  corporation, or of a partnership, 
 
 
 8

ELEVENTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend this Certificate of Incorporation, and to change or repeal any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner prescribed at the time by statute, and all rights conferred upon stockholders by such Certificate of Incorporation are granted subject to this reservation.
