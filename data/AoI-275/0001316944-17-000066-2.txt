The directors shall be nominated and elected in such manner and for such terms of office as provided by the Acts and the Rules and Regulations. Directors are divided into two classes: (1) those who are officers or directors of a member of the Bank ("member directors"); and (2) those who are not member directors, but are elected by a plurality of the votes of the members of the Bank from among eligible persons nominated by the Board of Directors after consultation with the Affordable Housing Advisory Council of the Bank ("independent directors"). Member directors must constitute at least a majority, but no more than sixty percent, of the members of the Board of Directors, and independent directors must constitute at least forty percent of the members of the Board of Directors. At least two independent directors must also qualify as public interest directors. Annually, the Board shall determine how many, if any, of the independent director positions with terms beginning the following January 1 shall be public interest director positions, provided the Bank at all times has at least two public interest director positions. Independent directors shall be elected in an at-large election by a plurality of the members entitled to vote, with each member having the same number of votes as it has with respect to the election of member directors, determined as specified in the Acts and the Rules and Regulations. Member directors shall be elected as representing members located in a particular State, in t he manner and with the number of votes specified in the Acts and the Rules and Regulations.

The Bank may solicit potential nominees for independent director positions from members; trade groups; organizations representing affordable housing, economic development, consumer or community interests; or other interested parties. The Governance Committee shall review applications and other information submitted by potential nominees, and shall consider for nomination only those individuals who meet the eligibility requirements and knowledge or experience qualifications for the independent director positions as set forth in the Acts and Rules and Regulations. Before recommending for nomination any individual for an independent director position, the Governance Committee shall review the potential nominees with the Affordable Housing Advisory Council and shall consider the Council's comments in making a recommendation to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors, by a majority vote of the Directors present at a meeting, a quorum being present (excluding any Director who is not disinterested), shall nominate at least as man y qualified individuals as there are independent director positions to be filled in that election.

 Section 5 .     Officers of the Board of Directors: The officers of the Board of Directors shall be a chairman and a vice chairman, each of whom shall be elected for a two-year term by a majority of the directors from among the directors. The officers shall have such duties as are usually incident to their respective offices and such as may be assigned to them by the Board of Directors. 
 
 Section 6 .     Presiding Officers; Acting Officers: At all meetings of the Board of Directors, the chairman, or in his or her absence the vice chairman, or in the absence of both of these officers, a chairman pro tempore selected by vote of a majority of the directors present at the meeting, shall preside. If the position of chairman is vacant or if a majority of the directors determines by action of the Board of Directors that the chairman is more than temporarily unable to carry out the duties of office, the vice chairman shall act as chairman until the next regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors, at which meeting the Board of Directors shall by majority vote elect a new chairman to complete the chairman's term. If the position of vice chairman is vacant or if a majority of the directors determines by action of the Board of Directors that the vice chairman is more than temporarily unable to carry out the duties of office, the chairman of the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors shall serve as the acting vice chairman until the next regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors, at which meeting the Board of Directors shall by majority vote elect a new vice chairman to complete the vice chairman's term. An acting officer of the Board of Directors shall have all  the powers of the incumbent office. 
 
 Section 7 .     Removal of Officers of the Board of Directors: A chairman, vice chairman, or acting chairman or vice chairman of the Board of Directors may be removed from his or her position as an officer of the Board of Directors for good cause by vote of a majority of the directors.

 General Provisions 
 
 Section 1 .     Budgets: The Board of Directors shall annually adopt an operating expense budget and a capital expenditures budget (subject to amendment from time to time, as determined by the Board of Directors) and shall take such actions with respect to such budgets as are required by the Acts and the Rules and Regulations. 
 
 Section 2 .     Bonds and Insurance: The Bank shall maintain adequate financial institution crime or fidelity bonds or similar bonds or insurance covering all officers, employees, attorneys, or agents having control  over or access to monies or securities owned by the Bank or in its possession. 
 
 Section 3.      Indemnification: 
 
 (a)     Actions Other than By or in the Right of the Bank. The Bank shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether formal or informal (other than an action by or in the right of the Bank) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee, manager, trustee or agent of the Bank, or is or was serving at the request of the Bank as a director, officer, employee, manager, trustee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or any joint office (including the Office of Finance), committee or council of the Federal Home Loan Banks, the Financing Corporation, the Resolution Funding Corporation or any other instrumentality or agency of the United States government, against expenses (including costs and attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Bank, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, c onviction, or upon a plea of   nolo contendere  or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Bank, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. 
 
 (b)     Actions By or in the Right of the Bank. The Bank shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Bank to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee, manager, trustee or agent of the Bank, or is or was serving at the request of the Bank as a director, officer, employee, manager, trustee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or any joint office (including the Office of Finance), committee or council of the Federal Home Loan Banks, the Financing Corporation, the Resolution Funding Corporation or any other instrumentality or agency of the United States government, against expenses (including costs and attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her or in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed  to the best interests of the 
 
 
 
 
 
 Approved 1/27/17

Bank, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Bank, unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such court shall deem proper. As used in this paragraph, the term "expenses" includes, without limitation, attorneys' fees and any expenses of successfully establishing a right to indemnification under this section. 
 
 (c)     Entitlement to Indemnification. To the extent that a current or former director, officer, employee, manager, trustee or agent of the Bank has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including costs and attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. 
 
 (d)     Authorization of Indemnification under paragraphs (a) and (b). Except as provided in paragraph (c), any indemnification under paragraphs (a) and (b) (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Bank only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the current or former director, officer, employee, manager, trustee or agent is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b). Such determination shall be made (1) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, (2) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion. 
 
 (e)     Right of Indemnitees to Bring Suit. In the event any indemnification provided by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is not made in full within ninety days after a written claim therefor has been received by the Bank from a director, officer, employee, manager, trustee or agent entitled to indemnification pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section or as to whom indemnification has been authorized pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, the claimant may at any time thereafter, subject to any arbitration or other agreement between the claimant and the Bank, bring suit against the Bank to recover the unpaid amount of the claim for indemnification and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to recover also the expens e of prosecuting such claim for indemnification. 
 
 (f)     Advance Payment of Expenses. Expenses (including costs and attorneys' fees) incurred by a director, officer, employee, manager, trustee or agent in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Bank in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Bank as authorized in this section. Such expenses (including costs and attorneys' fees) incurred by former directors and officers or other employees and agents and trustees may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Bank deems appropriate.Without limiting the foregoing, an unsecured undertaking to repay the Bank in the event such person is ultimately determined not to be entitled to indemnifica tion shall be considered a reasonable condition upon which to advance such costs and expenses.
