A proxy may be   made   irrevocable regardless of whether the interest with   which   it is   coupled   is an interest in the   stock   itself   or an   interest   in   the   Corporation generally.   The authorization of a proxy may, but need not, be limited to   specified   action, provided, however, that if   a   proxy limits its authorization to   a   meeting or meetings   of stockholders,   unless otherwise   specifically   provided   such   proxy   shall entitle   the holder thereof to   vote at any adjourned session   but   shall   not be valid after   the   final adjournment thereof   A   proxy purporting to be authorized by   or   on behalf of   a stockholder,   if   accepted   by the   Corporation   in its discretion, shall be deemed   valid   unless challenged at or prior to   its exercise, and   the burden of proving invalidity   shall   rest   on   the   challenger.
