If none of the stockholders who submitted the request for a special meeting appears or sends a qualified representative to present the nominations proposed to be presented or other business proposed to be conducted at the special meeting, the Corporation need not present such nominations or other business for a vote at such meeting.

Section 2.7.1         The holders of a majority of the shares of capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy (provided the proxy has authority to vote on at least one matter at such meeting), shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of stockholders for the transaction of business, except when stockholders are required to vote by class, in which event a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of the appropriate class shall be present in person or by proxy (provided the proxy has authority to vote on at least one matter at such meeting) in order to constitute a quorum as to such class vote, and except as otherwise provided by the DGCL or by the Certificate of Incorporation.

Except as provided below with respect to Contested Elections, each nominee for director shall be elected by the majority of the votes cast (which includes votes withheld) with respect to that nominee's election at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present.  Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in any Contested Election.  For purposes of these Bylaws, a " Contested Election" means an election of directors with respect to which, as of five days prior to the date the Corporation first mails the notice of meeting for such meeting to stockholders, there are more nominees for election than positions on the Board of Directors to be filled by election at the meeting.  In determining the number of votes cast in a Contested Election, abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will not be treated as votes cast.  The provisions of this paragraph will govern with respect to all votes of stockholders except as otherwise provided for in the Certificate of Incorporation or by a specific statutory provision superseding the provisions of these Bylaws. 
   
Section 2.8.2         Every stockholder having the right to vote shall be entitled to vote in person, or by proxy: (a) appointed by an instrument in writing subscribed by such stockholder or by his or her duly authorized attorney or (b) authorized by the transmission of an electronic record by the stockholder to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a firm which solicits proxies or like agent who is authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive the transmission subject to any procedures the Board of Directors may adopt from time to time to determine that the electronic record is authorized by the stockholder;  provided, however, that no such proxy shall be valid after the expiration of six (6) months from the date of its execution, unless coupled with an interest, or unless the person executing it specifies therein the length of time for which it is to continue in force, which in no case shall exceed seven (7) years from the date of its execution.  If such instrument or record shall designate two (2) or more persons to act as proxies, unless such instrument shall provide the contrary, a majority of such persons present at any meeting at which their powers thereunder are to be exercised shall have and may exercise all the powers of voting or giving consents thereby conferred, or if only one (1) be present, then such powers may be exercised by that one (1).  Unless required by the DGCL or determined by the Chairman of the meeting to be advisable, the vote on any matter need not be by written ballot.  No stockhold er shall have cumulative voting rights. 
   
 SECTION 2.9.       Consent of Stockholders.  Whenever the vote of the stockholders at a meeting thereof is required or permitted to be taken for or in connection with any corporate action, the meeting and vote of stockholders may be dispensed with if stockholders, having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, consent in writing to such corporate action being taken; provided, that in no case shall the written consent be by the holders of stock having less than the minimum percentage of the vote required by the DGCL.  Any action by consent of the stockholders pursuant to this Section 2.9 must follow the notice and timing procedures of Section 2.5 applicable to any business to be conducted at a stockholder meeting.  Further, upon the request of a stockholder to conduct a consent solicitation, the Board of Directors shall adopt a resolution fixing a record date within ten (10) days of the date on which a request therefor is received, provided that such record date shall  not be more than ten (10) days after the date of the adoption of such resolution. 
   
 SECTION 2.10.   Voting of Stock of Certain Holders.  Shares standing in the name of another entity, domestic or foreign, may be voted by such officer, agent or proxy as the governing documents of such entity may prescribe, or in the absence of such provision, as the Board of Directors or governing body of such entity may determine.  Shares standing in the name of a deceased person may be voted by the executor or administrator of such deceased person, either in person or by proxy.  Shares standing in the name of a guardian, conservator or trustee may be voted by such fiduciary, either in person or by proxy, but no such fiduciary shall be entitled to vote shares held in such fiduciary capacity without a transfer of such shares into the name of such fiduciary.  Shares outstanding in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver.  A stockholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such shares, unless in the transfer by the pledgor on the books of the Corporation, he or she has expressly empowered the pledgee to vote thereon, in which case only the pledgee, or his or her proxy, may represent the s tock and vote thereon. 
   
 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
   
 SECTION 2.11.     Treasury Stock.  The Corporation shall not vote, directly or indirectly, shares of its own stock owned by it; and such shares shall not be counted in determining the total number of outstanding  shares. 
   
 SECTION 2.12.   Fixing Record Date.  The Board of Directors may fix in advance a date for any meeting of stockholders (which date shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days preceding the date of any such meeting of stockholders), a date for payment of any dividend or distribution, a date for the allotment of rights, a date when any change or conversion or exchange of capital stock shall go into effect, or a date in connection with obtaining a consent of stockholders (which date shall not precede or be more than ten (10) days after the date the resolution setting such record date is adopted by the Board of Directors), in each case as a record date (the " Record Date") for the determination of the stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, any such meeting and any adjournment thereof, to receive payment of any such dividend or distribution, to receive any such allotment of rights, to exercise the rights in respect of any such change, conversion or exchange of capital stock, or to give such consent, as the case may be.  In any such case such stockholders and only such stockholders as shall be stockholders of record on the Record Date shall be entitled to such notice of and to vote at any such meeting and any adjournment thereof, to receive payment of such dividend or distribution, to receive such allotment of rights, to exercise such rights, or to give such consent, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any stock on the books of the Corporation after any such Record Date. 
   
 SECTION 2.13.  Inspectors . The Board of Directors, in advance of any meeting, may, but need not, appoint one or more inspectors of election to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof.  If an inspector or inspectors are not so appointed, the person presiding at the meeting may, but need not, appoint one or more inspectors.  In case any person who may be appointed as an inspector fails to appear or act, the vacancy may be filled by appointment made by the directors in advance of the meeting or at the meeting by the person presiding thereat.  Each inspector, if any, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability.  The inspectors, if any, shall determine the number of shares of stock outstanding and the voting power of each, the shares of stock represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the validity and effect of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine all challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, determine the result, and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders.  On request of the person presiding at the meeting, the inspector or inspectors, if any, shall make a report in writing of any challenge, question or matter determined by such inspector or inspectors and execute a certificate of any fact found by such inspector or inspectors.
