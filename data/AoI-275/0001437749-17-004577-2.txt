The Managing General Partner shall do all things necessary to comply with the Delaware Act, the Code or other applicable law, statute, rule, regulation or guideline of any federal, state or other governmental agency or any stock exchange on which the Depositary Units or other securities of the Partnership are listed for trading, and is authorized and directed to do all things it deems necessary or advisable in connection with any  such future issuance.

 7.10      Capital Accounts. The Partnership shall maintain Capital Accounts for the Partners and Assignees and Deferred Accounts for the Class B Unitholders in accordance with the following provisions of th is Section 7.10: 
   
(A)     The Partnership shall maintain for each General Partner a separate General Partner Capital Account. Such General Partner Capital Account shall be increased by (1) the cash amount or Net Agreed Value of all Capital Contributions made by such General Partner pursuant to this Agreement and (2) all items of Partnership income and gain computed in accordance with Section 7.10(B) and allocated to such General Partner pursuant to Section 8.1 and decreased by (3) the cash amount or Net Agreed Value of all distributions of cash or property made to such General Partner pursuant to this Agreement and (4) all items of Partnership deductions and loss computed in accordance with Section 7.10(B) and allocated to such  General Partner pursuant to Section 8.1. 
   
The Partnership shall maintain for each Limited Partner and Assignee a separate Limited Partner Capital Account with respect to the Class A Units held by such Limited Partner or Assignee. The Limited Partner Capital Account associated with each Limited Partner's or Assignee's Class A Units shall be increased by (1) the cash amount or the Net Agreed Value of all Capital Contributions made in exchange for the issuance of such Class A Units, and (2) all items of income and gain computed in accordance with Section 7.10(B) and allocated with respect to such Class A Units pursuant to Section 8.1 and decreased by (3) the cash amount or Net Agreed Value of all distributions of cash or property made with respect to such Class A Units pursuant to this Agreement and (4) all items of deduction and loss computed in accordance with Section 7.10(B) and allocated with respect to such Class A Units pursu ant to Section 8.1. 
   
The Partnership shall maintain for each Class B Unitholder a separate Deferred Account with respect to the Class B Units held by such Class B Unitholder. The Deferred Accounts shall initially have a zero balance and shall be increased or decreased for all items of income, gain and loss allocated to the Class B Unitholders pursuant to Section 8.1 and shall be decreased by all distributions to the Class B Unitholders pursuant to Section 9.1(B); provided that if it is ultimately established pursuant to a Final Determination that the Class B Unitholders' contributions to the Partnership in exchange for Class B Units have an ascertainable value as of the Closing Date, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the Deferred Accounts in a manner consistent with such determination. The Deferred Accounts shall be adjusted as provided in Section 7.10(D) upon the issuance of Class A Units to the Class B Unitholders pursuant to Section 7.11. Following the conversion of all of the Class B Units to Class A Units or upon the lapse of the right to convert Class B Units, any remaining balance of the Deferred Account shall be transferred to any General Partner Capital Account of the subject Class B Unitholder. 
   
 
   
 32 
 
   
 
   
(B)     For purposes of computing the amount of any item of income, gain, deduction or loss to be reflected in the Capital Accounts or Deferred Accounts, the determination, recognition and classification of such item shall generally be the same as its determination, recognition and classification for federal income tax purposes, provided that: 
   
(1)     Any deductions for depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to a Contributed Property shall be determined as if the Adjusted Basis of such property on the date it was acquired by the Partnership were equal to the Agreed Value of such property. Upon an adjustment pursuant to Section 7.10(D) to the Carrying Value of any Partnership property subject to depreciation, cost recovery or amortization, any further deductions for such depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to such property shall be determined as if the Adjusted Basis of such property were equal to the Carrying Value of such property immediately following such adjustment. 
   
(2)     Any income, gain or loss attributable to the disposition of any property shall be determined by the Partnership as if the Adjusted Basis of such property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to the Partnership's Carrying Value with respect to such property as of such date. 
   
(3)     If the Partnership's Adjusted Basis in a property is reduced for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 48(q)(1) of the Code, the amount of such reduction shall, solely for purposes hereof, be deemed to be an additional depreciation or cost recovery deduction in the year such property is placed in service and shall be allocated among the Partners and Assignees pursuant to Section 8.1(A). Any restoration of such Adjusted Basis pursuant to Section 48(q)(2) of the Code shall be allocated in the same manner to the Partner s and Assignees to whom such deemed deduction was allocated. 
   
(4)     The computation of all items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be made without regard to any election under Section 754 of the Code which may be made by the Partnership and, as to those items described in Section 705(a)(1)(B) or Section 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code, without regard to the fact that such items are not includable in gross income or  are neither currently deductible nor capitalizable for federal income tax purposes. 
   
(5)     All fees and expenses incurred by the Partnership to promote the sale of (or to sell) a Partnership interest that can neither be deducted nor amortized under Section 709 of the Code shall, for purposes of maintaining Capital Accounts, be treated as an item of deduction and shall be allocated among the Partners and Assignees pursuant to Section 8.1. 
   
 
   
 33 
 
   
 
   
(C)     Generally, a transferee of a Unit shall succeed to the Capital Account associated with the Unit transferred. However, if the transfer causes a termination of the Partnership under Section 708(b)(1)(B) of the Code, the Partnership Properties shall be deemed to have been distributed in liquidation of the Partnership to the Partners and Assignees (including the transferee of a Unit) and recontributed by such Partners and Assignees in reconstitution of the Partnership. In such event, the Carrying Values of the Partnership properties shall be adjusted immediately prior to such deemed distribution pursuant to Section 7.10(E) (and such adjusted Carrying Values shall constitute the Agreed Values of such properties upon their deemed recontribution to the reconstituted Partnership). The Capital Accounts of such reconstituted Partnership shall be maintained in accordance with the principles  of this Section 7.10. 
   
(D)     (1)     Upon a Class B Unitholder's conversion of Class B Units to Class A Units pursuant to Section 7.11, any balance in the Deferred Account of such Class B Unitholder shall be transferred to the Limited Partner Capital Account maintained with respect to the Class A Units received by such Class B Unitholder upon the conversion, but only to the extent that the resulting Limited Partner Capital Account balance of the Class B Unitholder with respect to the Class A Units received does not exceed the Prescribed Capital Balance attributable to such Class A Units. The Capital Account of each Partner and Assignee (including the Capital Account of the Class B Unitholder with respect to the Class A Units received) shall immediately be adjusted to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss allocated to such Partner pursuant to Section 7.10(D)(3). Following this adjustment to the Capital Accounts, the Limited Partner Capital Accounts of all Limited Partners and Assignees (including any Class B Unitholder holding any Class A Units, including those issued upon the conversion) shall, if and to the extent necessary, be appropriately adjusted to reflect a balance equal to each such Partner's or Assignee's Prescribed Capital Balance. 
   
(1)     Upon the issuance of Class A Units to Mauna Loa pursuant to Section 7.12, with respect to the Units issued, Mauna Loa's General Partner Capital Account shall be reduced by the Conversion Reduction Amount relating to such issuance of Class A Units and Mauna Loa's Limited Partner Capital Account shall immediately be increased by an amount equal to this  Conversion Reduction Amount. 
   
(2)     Upon the conversion of Class B Units to Class A Units pursuant to Section 7.11 or upon an issuance of additional Class A Units pursuant to Section 7.8 or Section 7.12, the Capital Accounts of all Partners and Assignees, and the Carrying Values of all Partnership Properties shall, upon such conversion or issuance, be adjusted (consistent with the provisions hereof) to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to all Partnership Properties. Upon the conversion of Class B Units to Class A Units pursuant to Section 7.11, any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss shall be allocated 1% to the General Partners in accordance with their Allocable Shares, and 99% to the Limited Partners (including any Class B Unitholder participating in such conversion) and Assignees as follows: (a) first, any such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss allocated to the Limited Partners and Assignees shall be allocated among the Limited Partners and Assignees in a manner that will, to the extent possible, bring the Capital Accounts of the Limited Partners and Assignees into a relative balance reflective of such parties' respective Allocable Shares (as adjusted for the issuance of the Class A Units resulting from the conversion), and (b) second, any remaining Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss allocated to the Limited Partners and Assignees shall be allocated among the Limited Partners and Assignees in accordance with their respective Allocable Shares (as adjusted for the issuance of the Class A Units resulting from the conversion). Upon an issuance of Class A Units pursuant to Section 7.8 or Section 7.12, any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss shall be allocated among the Partners and Assignees (immediately prior to such issuance) in accordance with their Allocable Shares. 
   
 
   
 34 
 
   
 
   
(3)     For purposes of this Section 7.10(D), the aggregate fair market value of the Partnership Properties, as of any date of determination, shall be equal to the sum of (i) the Prescribed Asset Value as of such date, (ii) the Capital Conversion Balance as of such date, (iii) the balance of the Class B Unitholders' Deferred Accounts as of such date, and (iv) the amount of any outstanding Partnership indebtedness as of such date, as determined in the discretion of the Managing General Partner. The Carrying Values of the respective Partnership Properties shall be adjusted according to their relative fair market values, as determined by the Managing General Partner utilizing such methods as it deems appropriate. 
   
(E)     Immediately prior to the distribution of any Partnership Properties, the Capital Accounts of all Partners and the Carrying Values of all Partnership Properties shall be adjusted to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to the Partnership Properties. In the case of a current distribution pursuant to Section 9.2 or a deemed distribution occurring as a result of Section 708 of the Code, such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss (determined in the manner provided in Section 7.10(D)(4)) shall be allocated among the Partners and Assignees in accordance with their Allocable Shares. In the case of a liquidating distribution pursuant to Section 15.4, such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss (determined by the Managing General Partner or other liquidator, using such reasonable method of valuation as it may adopt) shall be allocated among the Partners, Assignees and Class B Unitholders in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.1 as if such assets had been sold in a Capital Transaction. 
   
(F)     In the event that it is determined pursuant to a Final Determination that the Underwriters purchasing Class A Units pursuant to Section 7.3(B) will not be treated as partners for purposes of the application of Section 743 of the Code, such issuance of Class A Units shall be treated as an issuance of additional Class A Units for purposes of Sections 7 .8 and 7.10 hereof. 
   
 7.11      Conversion of Class B Units to Class A Units. The outstanding Class B Units shall from time to time be converted to Class A Units in accordance with this Section 7.11: 
   
(A)     If for the year ending December 31, 1986, the Partnership has First Year Excess Cash Flow, then, effective as of December 31, 1986, that number of Class B Units shall be converted to Class A Units determined by the following quotient: such First Year Excess Cash Flow divided by the Unit Price of the Class A Units as of December 31, 1986. Any Class A Unit issued pursuant to this Section 7.11(A) shall be redeemed by the Partnership pursuant to Section 9.3. 
   
 
   
 35 
 
   
 
   
(B)     If as of December 31, 1990, there is a positive balance in the Cash Account (taking into account any required transfers from the Operating Cash Account to the Cash Account pursuant to Section 10.6(D) for the period through December 31, 1990), then, effective as of March 31, 1991, that number of Class B Units shall be converted to Class A Units determined according to the following quotient: such positive balance divided by the Unit Price of the Class A Units as of March 31, 1991. Any Class A Units issued pursuant to this Secti on 7. 11(B) shall be redeemed by the Partnership pursuant to Section 9.3. 
   
(C)     If for any year of the Partnership after 1990 and prior to 2007 while Class B Units remain outstanding, the Partnership has made Cumulative Excess Distributions, as determined based on distributions for periods through the end of such year, then, effective as of March 31 of the next year or the first Record Date for distributions for such year if other than March 31, that number of Class B Units outstanding shall be converted to Class A Units as determined by the following quotient: such Cumulative Excess Distributions divided  by the Annual Indicated Distributions per Unit for such prior fiscal year. 
   
 7.12      Issuance of Additional Class A Units to Mauna Loa. In consideration of any additional Capital Contributions required to be made by Mauna Loa pursuant to Section 7.2(C), Mauna Loa shall be entitled to be issued additional Class A Units in accordance with this Section 7.12. If for any year of the Partnership after 1990, the Partnership has made Cumulative Excess Distributions, determined based on distributions for periods through the end of such year, and after taking into consideration any conversion of Class B Units to Class A Units pursuant to Section 7.11(C) with respect to such year, then, effective as of March 31 of the next year or the first Record Date for distributions for such year if other than March 31, that number of additional Class A Units shall be issued to Mauna Loa as determined by the following formula: the lesser of (A) the quotient derived by dividing such Cumulative Excess Distributions by the Annual Indicated Distributions per Unit for such prior year, or (B) the quotient derived by dividing the Capital Conversion Balance, as of the end of such prior year, by the Unit Price of the Class A Un its as of the date of conversion. 
   
 7.13      Registration of Class A Units. At any time after the conversion of Class B Units to Class A Units by Mauna Loa or the issuance of Class A Units to Mauna Loa in consideration of any additional Capital Contributions by Mauna Loa, upon the request of Mauna Loa, the Partnership shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission as promptly as practicable after receiving such request. and use its best efforts to cause to become effective, a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 registering the offering and sale of all or a portion of the Class A Units owned by Mauna Loa and included in such request; provided that the Partnership shall not be required to file more than one such registration solely with respect to the Class A Units owned by Mauna Loa each year. If the Partnership has executed a letter of intent with respect to a proposed offering of Class A Units with a prospective managing underwriter and intends to file a registration statement within thirty (30) days, and if the managing underwriter advises Mauna Loa in writing that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of Class A Units to be underwritten, then the number of Class A Units that may be included in the underwriting by Mauna Loa shall be limited as provided below and the registration shall not be considered to be solely with respect to Class A Units owned by Mauna Loa. If (but without any obligation to do so) the Partnership proposes to register (including for this purpose a registration effected by the Partnership for Unitholders other than Mauna Loa) any of its Class A Units or other securities in connection with an underwritten public offering of the securities solely for cash (other than a registration relating solely to the sale of securities to participants in a Partnership employee benefit plan, a Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 145 transaction, or a registration on any form which does not include substantially the same information as would be required to be included in a registration statement covering the sale of Class A Units held by Mauna Loa), the Partnership shall, at such time, promptly give Mauna Loa written notice of the proposed registration. Upon the written request of Mauna Loa given within twenty (20) days after giving of such notice by the Partnership, the Partnership shall cause to be included in the filing all of the Class A Units that Mauna Loa has requested to be registered. The Partnership may withdraw any such filing at any time before it becomes effective, or postpone its effectiveness, without any obligation or liability to Mauna Loa. The Partnership shall not be required to include any of Mauna Loa's securities in an underwritten offering of the Partnership's securities unless Mauna Loa accepts the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between the Partnership and the underwriters selected by it and agrees to execute such documents in connection with the registration as the Partnership may reasonably request. If the total amount of securities, including Class A Units owned by Mauna Loa, requested to be included in the offering exceeds the amount of securities that the underwriters reasonably believe compatible with the success of the offering, then the Partnership shall be required to include in the offering only that number of such securities, including Class A Units owned by Mauna Loa, which the underwriters believe in their sole discretion will not jeopardize the success of the offering (the securities so included to be apportioned pro rata among the selling security holders according to the total amount of securities entitled to be included therein owned by each selling security holder or in such other proportion as shall be mutually agreed to by such selling security holders). In connection with any registration pursuant to this Section 7.13, the Partnership shall promptly prepare and file such documents as may be necessary to register or qualify such Class A Units subject to such registration under the securities laws of such states as Mauna Loa shall reasonably request and do any and all other acts and things which may reasonably be necessary or advisable to enable Mauna Loa to consummate a public sale of such Class A Units in such states. Registrations effected under this paragraph shall be effected at the expense of Mauna Loa  in proportion to the securities registered for Mauna Loa. 
   
 
   
 36 
 
   
 
   
 7.14      Changes in Outstanding Units. The Managing General Partner is authorized to effect any Class A Unit split or declare and pay pro rata distributions of Class A Units to the holders of Class A Units. In the event of any such Class A Unit split or distribution, appropriate adjustments shall be made to the Indicated Distributions per Unit and the number of Class B Units convertible into Cl ass A Units.

(1)     In the case of a Contributed Property, such items shall be allocated among the Partners and Assignees in a manner that takes into account the variation between the Agreed Value of such property and its Adjusted Basis at the time of contribution in attempting to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (C) below, any items of Residual Gain or Residual Loss attributable to a Contributed Property shall be allocated among the Partners and Assignees in accordance with their respective Allocable Shar es. 
   
 
   
 38 
 
   
 
   
(2)     In the case of an Adjusted Property, such items shall (a) first, be allocated among the Partners and Assignees in a manner (consistent with the principles of Section 704 and the regulations thereunder) which takes into account the Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such property and the allocations thereof pursuant to Section 7.10(D)(3) in attempting to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities, and (b) second, in the event such property was originally a Contributed Property, be allocated among the Partners and Assignees in a manner consistent with the first sentence of paragraph (B)(1) above.

(D)     All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit recognized by the Partnership for federal income tax purposes and allocated to the Partners and Assignees in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be determined without regard to any election under Section 754 of the Code which may be made by the Partnership; provided, however, such allocations, once made, shall be adjusted as necessary to take into account those adjustments authorized under Sections 734 and 743 of the Code. 
   
(E)     To the extent of any Recapture Income resulting from the sale or other taxable disposition of a Partnership Property, the amount of any gain from such disposition allocated to a Partner or Assignee (or its successor in interest) for federal income tax purposes pursuant to the foregoing provisions shall be deemed to be Recapture Income to the extent such Partner or Assignee (or successor) has been allocated or has claimed any deduction directly or indirectly giving rise to the treatment of such gain as Recapture Income (to the extent such Partner or Assignee (or successor) has not theretofore recognized such income upon an issuance of Class A Units by the Partnership).

The Managing General Partner will vote, and exercise other powers attributable to Class A Units owned by an Assignee at the direction of such Assignee. Unless the Depositary is notified to the contrary, the Managing General Partner shall be deemed to have given its consent to the admission of a transferee as a Substituted Limited Partner, and such admission shall be effective, at and from the close of business on the last business day of the calendar month in which a properly executed Transfer Application is received by a Transfer Agent.

Any such action by the Limited Partners for removal of the Managing General Partner must also provide for the election of a new Managing General Partner. The right of the Limited Partners to remove the Managing General Partner shall not exist or be exercised unless the Partnership has received an opinion of independent counsel that the removal of the Managing General Partner and the selection of a successor Managing General Partner will not result in (i) the loss of limited liability of any Limited Partner or (ii) the treatment of the  Partnership as an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. 
   
 14.3      Withdrawal or Removal of Special General Partner . 
   
(A)     Mauna Loa covenants and agrees that it shall continue to act as Special General Partner of the Partnership until the date which is ten years after the Closing Date, subject to its right to transfer its interest as a General Partner pursuant to Section 14.8 of this Agreement. At any time after the date which is ten years from the Closing Date, the Special General Partner may withdraw from the Partnership upon at least 90 days' advance written notice to the Managing General Partner, except as otherwise provided herein, such withdrawal to take effect on the date specified in such notice. Except as provided in Section 14.8, the transfer by the Special General Partner of all of its interest as a General Partner shall constitute the withdrawal of the Special General Partner for purposes of this Section 14.3(A). Upon receiving such notice, the Managing General Partner shall select a successor Special General Partner within such 90-day period. Such withdrawal of the Special General Partner shall not become effective unless the Partnership has received by the end of such 90-day period an opinion of independent counsel that the Special General Partner's withdrawal from the Partnership (following the selection of the successor Special General Partner) would not cause the Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. 
   
(B)     If the Special General Partner ceases to be a General Partner, the Managing General Partner shall as promptly as practicable select a successor Special General Partner. Pending such selection, the person who is at the time the President of the Special General Partner shall be the Special General Partner, effective as of the time the Special General P artner ceases to be a General Partner. 
   
(C)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, a successor Special General Partner need not be selected if (i) the Partnership has received an opinion of counsel that the failure to select a successor would not result in the Partnership being treated as an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or (ii) the Partnership is already treated in all material respects as an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. If a successor Special General Partner is not selected, the Managing General Partner shall have the rights, and be subject to the obligations, of a successor to the Special General Partner. 
   
 14.4      Admission of Successor Managing General Partner. A successor Managing General Partner selected pursuant to Section 14.2 or the transferee of or successor to the entire Partnership Interest of the Managing General Partner shall be admitted to the Partnership as the Managing General Partner, effective as of the date an amendment or restatement of the Certificate of Limited Partnership is filed with the Sec retary of State of the State of Delaware effecting such substitution.

 14.6      Rights on Removal or Withdrawal. A General Partner which has ceased to be a General Partner shall be entitled to all compensation accrued as of the date of its removal or withdrawal and shall have the same rights to inspect and make copies or excerpts of the books and records of the Partnership as is provided to Limited Partners until all amounts due the General Partner as of the date the General Partner ceased to be a General Partner have been paid. The General Partner shall be a creditor of the Partnership as to all such amounts owed to it by the Partnership, and shall not have any portion of its interest as General Partner converted to an interest as a Limited Partner or Assignee except as provided in Sections 7.11, 7.12 and 14.11. As to any Class A Units so held or received, the General Partner shall be entitled to exercise all of the voting rights provided under this Agreement as a Partner. 
   
 14.7      Liability on Removal or Withdrawal. If, at the time of the Departing Partner's departure, the Partnership is indebted to the Departing Partner under this Agreement or any other instrument or agreement for funds advanced, properties sold, services rendered, or costs and expenses incurred by the Departing Partner, the Partnership shall, within sixty (60) days after the effective date of such Departing Partner's departure, pay to the Departing Partner the full amount of such indebtedness.

When any Person ceases to be a General Partner under this Agreement or a partner, director or officer of a General Partner, that Person shall continue to have the benefit of any provisions of this Agreement providing for indemnity, exculpation or insurance which protected the Person as a General Partner or a partner, director or officer of a General Partner, or which limited or defined the liability of the Person with respect to activities in which such Person engaged as a General Partner. 
   
 
   
 54 
 
   
 
   
 14.9      Automatic Continuation of Partnership. If a General Partner ceases to be a General Partner (other than by removal which does not in any event dissolve the Partnership), the Partnership shall not be dissolved and its business shall be continued by the remaining General Partner or Partners, if any. The remaining General Partner or Partners agree to take any and all reasonable steps to continue th e business of the Partnership. 
   
 14.10      Vote on Continuation of Partnership. Unless a higher vote is required by the Delaware Act, upon an event of dissolution described in Section 15.1(A), the Partnership shall thereafter be terminated unless a Majority Interest (and all Partners hereby expressly consent that such an election may be effected upon written consent of a Majority Interest) pursuant to Section 6.9(A)(5) elects to continue the Partnership.

 (b)     the Partnership shall continue; and 
   
(c)     all necessary steps shall be taken to amend the Agreement, and the successor Managing General Partner may for this purpose exercise the powers of attorney granted pursuant  to Article 16. 
   
 14.11      Interest of Departing Partner and Successor . 
   
(A)     A Departing Partner shall, at the option of its successor exercisable prior to the effective date of the departure of the Departing Partner, promptly receive from its successor in exchange for its interest as a General Partner, an amount in cash equal to the fair market value of the Departing Partner's interest as a General Partner, determined as of the effective date of departure. If the option is exercised, the Departing Partner shall, as of the effective date of departure, cease to share in any allocations or distributions with respect to its interest as a General Partner. For purposes of this Section 14.11, the fair market value of the Departing Partner's Partnership Interest as a General Partner he rein shall be such value as may be agreed by the Departing Partner and the successor. 
   
(B)     If the successor to a Departing Partner does not exercise the option described in Section 12.12(A) or, in the case of the Special General Partner, if no successor has been selected, the interest of the Departing Partner as a General Partner of the Partnership shall be converted into Class A Units on a basis agreed by the Partnership and the Departing  Partner. 
   
 
   
 55 
 
   
 
   
(C)     In the absence of an agreement pursuant to (A) or (B) above within thirty (30) days after the effective date of the Departing Partner's departure, the value of the interests of the Departing Partner shall be determined by an appraiser selected by the Departing Partner and its successor (or, in the case of the Special General Partner, the Partnership if no successor has been selected), the determination of which shall be conclusive as to the matter. If those parties cannot agree as to such appraiser within forty-five (45) days after the effective date of such departure, then such appraiser shall be designated by two appraisers selected by the Departing Partner and its successor. 
   
(D)     If the successor to a Departing Partner does not exercise the option described in paragraph (A) above, the successor shall at the effective date of its admission to the Partnership contribute to the capital of the Partnership cash or property having a Net Agreed Value such that its General Partner Capital Account, after giving effect to such contribution, shall be equal to that percentage of the Capital Accounts of all Partners that is equal to its Allocable Share as Managing General Partner, in the case of a successor Managing General Partner, or its Allocable Share as Special General Partner, in the case of a successor Special General Partner. In such event, such successor shall be entitled to the All ocable Share, as the case may be, of all Partnership allocations and distributions.
