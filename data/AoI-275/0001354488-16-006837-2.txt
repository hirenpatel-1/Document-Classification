For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining, nonconverted shares of Series A Preferred Stock beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its affiliates, so long as such shares of Series A Preferred Stock are not convertible within sixty (60) days from the date of such determination, and (B) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including the Warrants) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its affiliates, so long as such other securities of the Company are not exercisable nor convertible within sixty (60) days from the date of such determination.  For purposes of this Section 6(c), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Holder may rely on the number of outstanding share s of Common Stock as reflected in the most recent of the following :  (A) the Company's most recent quarterly reports, Form 10-Q, Form 10-QSB, Annual Reports, Form 10-K, or Form 10-KSB, as the case may be, as filed with the  Commission  under  the  Exchange Act  (B)  a  more  recent  public  announcement  by the Company or (C) any other written notice by the Company or the Company's transfer agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.  Upon the written or oral request of the Holder, the Company shall within two (2) Trading Days confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding.  In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including the Series A Preferred Stock, by the Holder or its affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was publicly reported by the Company.  This Section 6(c) may be waived or amended only with the consent of the Holders of all of the Series A Preferred Stock and the consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of outstanding Common Stock of the Company who are not Affiliates.  For the purpose of the immediately preceding sentence, the term "Affiliate " shall mean any person :  (a) that directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with the Company, or (b) who beneficially owns  any shares of Series A Preferred Stock.  For purposes of this Section 6(c), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act.

 d.            Mechanics of Conversion. 
   
 i.            Delivery of Certificate Upon Conversion.  Except as otherwise set forth herein, not later than three Trading Days after each Conversion Date (the "Share Delivery Date"), the Company shall deliver to the Holder (A) a certificate or certificates which, after the Effective Date, shall be free of restrictive legends and trading restrictions (other than those required by the Purchase Agreement) representing the number of shares of Common Stock being acquired upon the conversion of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, and (B) a bank check in the amount of accrued and unpaid dividends (if the Company has elected or is required to pay accrued dividends in cash).  After the Effective Date, the Company shall, upon request of the Holder, deliver any certificate or certificates required to be delivered by the Company under this Section electronically through the Depository Trust Company or another established clearing Company  performing  similar  functions.  If  in  the  case  of  any  Notice  of  Conversion  such certificate or certificates are not delivered to or as directed by the applicable Holder by the third Trading Day after the Conversion Date, the Holder shall be entitled to elect by written notice to the Company at any time on or before its receipt of such certificate or certificates thereafter, to rescind such conversion, in which event the Company shall immediately return the certificates representing the shares of Series A Preferred Stock tendered for co nversion. 
   
 ii.            Obligation Absolute.  The  Company's obligations  to  issue and deliver the Conversion Shares upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or inaction by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against any Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder or any other  Person of any obligation to  the Company or any violation or  alleged violation of law by the Holder or any other person, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Company to the Holder in connection with the issuance of such Conversion Shares.  In the event a Holder shall elect to convert any or all of its Series A Preferred Stock, the Company may not refuse conversion based on any claim that such Holder or anyone associated or affiliated with the Holder of has been engaged in any violation of law, agreement or for any other reason, unless, an injunction from a court, on notice, restraining and or enjoining conversion of all or part of this Series A Preferred Stock shall have been sought and obtained and the Company posts a surety bond for the benefit of the Holder in the amount of 150% of the Conversion Value of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding, which is subject to the injunction, which bond shall remain in effect until the completion of arbitration/litigation of the dispute and the proceeds of which shall be payable to such Holder to the extent it obtains judgment.  In the absence of an injunction precluding the same, the Company shall issue Conversion Shares upon a properly noticed conversi on. 
   
 iii.            Reservation of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock solely for the purpose of issuance upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock, each as herein provided, free from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of persons other than the Holders, not less than such number of shares of the Common Stock as shall (subject to any additional requirements of the Company as to reservation of such shares set forth in the Purchase Agreement) be issuable (taking into account the adjustments and restrictions of Section 7) upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock.  The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly and validly authorized, issued and fully paid, non-assessable and, if the Conversion Shares Registration Statement is then effective under the Securities Act, registered for public sale in accordance with such Conversion Shares Registration Statement Fractional Shares.  Upon a conversion hereunder, the Company shall not be required to issue stock certificates representing fractions of shares of the Common Stock. 
   
 iv.            Transfer Taxes.  The issuance of certificates for shares of the Common Stock on conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be made without charge to the Holders thereof for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such certificate, provided that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such certificate upon conversion in a name other than that of the Holder of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock so converted and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such certificates unless or until the person or persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.

 Section 7.                       Certain Adjustments. 
   
 a.            Stock Dividends and Stock Splits .  If the Company, at any time while the Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding :  (A) shall pay a stock dividend or otherwise make a distribution or distributions on shares of its Common Stock or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable in- shares of Common Stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company pursuant to this Series A Preferred Stock), (B) subdivide outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (C) combine (including by way of reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (D) issue by reclassification of shares of the Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the Company, then the Conversion Value shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding after such event.  Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classi fication. 
   
 b.            Subsequent Equity Sales.

The term "MFN Transaction" shall mean a transaction in which the Company issues or sells any securities in a capital raising transaction or series of related transactions which grants to an investor the right to receive additional shares based upon future transactions of the Company on terms more favorable than those granted to such investor in such offering.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 7(b) shall not apply in respect of an Exempt Issuance, exce pt that no Variable Rate Transaction or MFN Transaction shall be an Exempt Issuance. 
   
 c.            Pro Rata Distributions.  If the  Company, at  any  time  while Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, shall distribute to all holders of Common Stock (and not to Holders) evidences of its indebtedness or assets or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any security, then in each such case the Conversion Value shall be determined by multiplying such Conversion Value in effect immediately prior to the record date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction of which the denominator shall be the VWAP determined as of the record date mentioned above, and of which the numerator shall be such VWAP on such record date less the then fair market value at such record date of the portion of such assets or evidence of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one outstanding share of the Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith.

Upon receipt of the notice described in the first sentence of this Section 6(b), together with the certificate(s) evidencing the Converting Shares, the Company shall be obligated to, and shall, cause to be issued and delivered in accordance with such instructions, as applicable, either (x) a statement from the Common Stock Transfer Agent evidencing ownership of the Converted Shares, registered in the name of the Holder or its designee on the Common Stock Transfer Agent's records in book-entry form under The Direct Registration System or (y) certificate(s) evidencing the Converted Shares and, if applicable, a certificate (which shall contain such applicable legends, if any, as were set forth on the surrendered certificate(s)) representing any shares which were represented by the certificate(s) surrendered to the Company in connection with such conversion but which were not Converting Shares and, therefore, were not converted. All or some Converted Shares so issued whether in book-entry form under the Direct Registration System or in certificated form may be subject to restrictions on transfer as required by applicable federal and state securities laws. Any such Converted Shares subject to restrictions on transfer under applicable federal and state securities laws shall be encumbered by stop transfer orders and restrictive legends (or equivalent encumbrances). Such conversion, to the extent permitted by law, shall be deemed to have been effected as of the close of business on the date on which such certificate(s) shall have been surrendered and such written notice shall have been received by the Company unless a later date has been specified by such Holder, and at such time the rights of the Holder of such Converting Shares as such Holder shall cease, and the Person(s) in whose name or names the Converted Shares are to be issued either in book-entry form or certificated form, as applicable, upon such conversion shall be deemed to have become the holder(s) of record of the Converted Shares. 
   
 (c)  Effect of Conversion. Upon the issuance of the Converted Shares in accordance with Section 6, such shares shall be deemed to be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. 
   
 (d)  Adjustments for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions. If the Company at any time or from time to time makes, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, in each such event the Conversion Number then in effect shall be increased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such record date is fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the Conversion Number then in effect by a fraction (i) the numerator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution and (ii) the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date. To the extent an adjustment is made in respect of the foregoing pursuant to Section 6(e) or the Holder actually receives the dividend to which any such adjustment relates, an adjustment shall not be made pursuant to this Section 6(d). 
   
 (e)  Conversion Number Adjustments for Subdivisions, Combinations or Consolidations of Common Stock . 
   
(i) In the event the Company should at any time or from time to time fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of shares of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional Common Share Equivalents, without payment of any consideration by such holder for additional Common Share Equivalents (including the additional Common Stock issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend, distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Number then in effect shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each such share of such Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be increased in proportion to such increase o f outstanding shares of Common Stock and shares issuable with respect to Common Share Equivalents. 
   
(ii) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time is decreased by a combination, consolidation, reclassification or reverse stock split of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or other similar event, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Number then in effect shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each such share of such Series B Convertible Preferred Stock shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding  shares of Common Stock. 
   
 (f)  Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination, merger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 6), provision shall be made so that the Holders shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock the number of shares of Capital Stock or other securities or property of the Company to which a holder of Common Stock would have been entitled on recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 6 with respect to the rights of the Holders after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section 6 (including adjustment of the Conversion Number then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred S tock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable. 
   
 (g)  Mergers and Other Reorganizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a reclassification of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for elsewhere in this Section 6) or a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another entity or the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's properties and assets to any other Person, then, as a part of and as a condition to the effectiveness of such reclassification, merger, consolidation or sale, lawful and adequate provision shall be made so that the Holders shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock the number of shares of Capital Stock or other securities or property, if any, of the Company or of the successor entity resulting from such reclassification, merger or consolidation or sale, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled in connection with such reclassification, merger, consolidation or sale. In any such case, appropriate provision shall be made with respect to the rights of the Holders after the reclassification, merger, consolidation or sale to the end that the provisions of this Section 6 (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustment of the Conversion Number and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be, with respect to any shares of Capital Stock, securities or property to be deliverable thereafter upon the conversion of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. 
   
Each Holder, upon the occurrence of a reclassification, merger or consolidation of the Company or the sale of all or substantially all its assets and properties, as such events are more fully set forth in the first paragraph of this Section 6(g), shall have the option of electing treatment of its shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock under either this Section 6(g) or Section 5 hereof, notice of which election shall be submitted in writing to the Company at its principal offices no later than ten (10) days before the effective date of such event, provided that any such notice of election shall be effective if given not later than fifteen (15) days after the date of the Company's notice pursuant to Section 6(h) hereof with respect to such event, and, provided, further, that if any Holder fails to give the Company such notice of election, the provisions of this Section 6(g) shall govern the treatment of such Holder's shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of such event. 
   
 (h)  Notices of Record Date. In the event (i) the Company fixes a record date to determine the holders of Common Stock who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or (ii) there occurs any capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification or recapitalization of the Common Stock of the Company, any merger or consolidation of the Company, or any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, the Company shall mail to each Holder at least ten (10) days prior to the record date specified therein, a notice specifying (a) the date of such record date for the purpose of such dividend or distribution and a description of such dividend or distribution, (b) the date on which any such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and (c) the time, if any, that is to be fixed, as to when the holders of record of Common Stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. 
   
 (i)  No Impairment. The Company will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Company, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 6 and in the taking of all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate  in order to protect the conversion rights of the Holders against impairment. 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 11 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 (j)  Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments. In lieu of any fractional shares to which a Holder would otherwise be entitled upon conversion, the Company shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the Market Price of one share of Common Stock, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Whether or not fractional shares are issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock of each Holder at the time converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable  upon such aggregate conversion. 
Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Number of any share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 6, the Company, at its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each Holder a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Company shall, upon the written request at any time of any Holder, furnish or cause to be furnished to such Holder a like certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment and readjustment, (B) the Conversion Number at the time in effect, and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of such Holder's shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. The provisions of Section 6(d), (e), (f) and (g) shall apply to any transaction and successively to any series of transactions that would require any adjustment pursuan t thereto. 
   
 (k)  Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (taking into account the adjustments required by this Section 6), such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the Holders, the Company will, as soon as is reasonably practicable, take all such action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but  unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes.

(i)           Each outstanding share of Class C Preferred Stock which is transferred to any holder other than an Eligible Class C Preferred Stock Holder shall automatically convert  into that number of fully paid and nonassessable Conversion Shares   equal to the Conversion Number at the time in effect. 
   
(ii)           If the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock plus Conversion Shares (issuable upon conversion of the Class B Convertible Preferred Stock and the Class C Convertible Preferred Stock) held by the Eligible Class C Preferred Stock Holders in the aggregate constitute 10% or less of the sum of (x) the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company plus (y) all Conversion Shares held by the Eligible Class C Preferred Stock Holders, then each outstanding Class C Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding will automati cally convert into that number of fully paid and nonassessable Conversion Shares   equal to the Conversion Number at the time in effect. 
   
(ii)           At such time as a Holder of Class C Preferred Stock ceases to be an Eligible Class C Preferred Stock Holder, each share of Class C Preferred Stock held by such person or entity shall immediately convert into that number of fully paid and nonassessable Conversion Shares   equal to the Conversion Number at the time in effect. 
   
 (c)  Conversion Procedures.  Each conversion of shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock shall be effected by the surrender of the certificate(s) evidencing the shares of S eries C Convertible Preferred Stock to be converted (the " Converting Shares") at the principal office of the Company (or such other office or agency of the Company as the Company may designate by notice in writing to the Holders of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock) at any time during its usual business hours, together with written notice by the holder of such Converting Shares, (i) stating that the Holder desires to convert the Converting Shares, or a specified number of such Converting Shares, evidenced by such certificate(s) into shares of Common Stock (the " Converted Shares"), and (ii) giving the name(s) (with addresses) and denominations in which the Converted Shares should either be registered with the Company's transfer agent and registrar for the  Common Stock (the " Common Stock Transfer Agent") on its records in book-entry form under The Direct Registration System or certificated, and, in either case, instructions for the delivery of a statement evidencing book-entry ownership of the Converted Shares or the certificates evidencing the Converted Shares. Upon receipt of the notice described in the first sentence of this Section 6(c), together with the certificate(s) evidencing the Converting Shares, the Company shall be obligated to, and shall, cause to be issued and delivered in accordance with such instructions, as applicable, either (x) a statement from the Common Stock Transfer Agent evidencing ownership of the Converted Shares, registered in the name of the Holder or its designee on the Common Stock Transfer Agent's records in book-entry form under The Direct Registration System or (y) certificate(s) evidencing the Converted Shares and, if applicable, a certificate (which shall contain such applicable legends, if any, as were set forth on the surrendered certificate(s)) representing any shares which were represented by the certificate(s) surrendered to the Company in connection with such conversion but which were not Converting Shares and, therefore, were not converted. All or some Converted Shares so issued whether in book-entry form under the Direct Registration System or in certificated form may be subject to restrictions on transfer as required by applicable federal and state securities laws. Any such Converted Shares subject to restrictions on transfer under applicable federal and state securities laws shall be encumbered by stop transfer orders and restrictive legends (or equivalent encumbrances). Such conversion, to the extent permitted by law, shall be deemed to have been effected as of the close of business on the date on which such certificate(s) shall have been surrendered and such written notice shall have been received by the Company unless a later date has been specified by such Holder, and at such time the rights of the Holder of such Converting Shares as such Holder shall cease, and the Person(s) in whose name or names the Converted Shares are to be issued either in book-entry form or certificated form, as applicable, upon such conversion shall be deemed to have become the holder(s) of record of the Converted Shares. 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 17

 (e)  Adjustments for Common Stock Dividends and Distributions. If the Company at any time or from time to time makes, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common Stock, in each such event the Conversion Number then in effect shall be increased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such record date is fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the Conversion Number then in effect by a fraction (i) the numerator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution and (ii) the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date. To the extent an adjustment is made in respect of the foregoing pursuant to Section 6(f) or the Holder actually receives the dividend to which any such adjustment relates, an adjustment shall not be made pursuant to this Section 6(e). 
   
 (f)  Conversion Number Adjustments for Subdivisions, Combinations or Consolidations of Common Stock . 
   
(i) In the event the Company should at any time or from time to time fix a record date for the effectuation of a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or the determination of holders of shares of Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in additional Common Share Equivalents, without payment of any consideration by such holder for additional Common Share Equivalents (including the additional Common Stock issuable upon conversion, exchange or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date of such dividend, distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is fixed), the Conversion Number then in effect shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each such share of such Series C Convertible Preferred Stock shall be increased in proportion to such increase o f outstanding shares of Common Stock and shares issuable with respect to Common Share Equivalents. 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 18 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
   
(ii) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time is decreased by a combination, consolidation, reclassification or reverse stock split of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or other similar event, then, following the record date of such combination, the Conversion Number then in effect shall be appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each such share of such Series C Convertible Preferred Stock shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding  shares of Common Stock. 
   
 (g)  Recapitalizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a recapitalization of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination, merger or sale of assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 6), provision shall be made so that the Holders shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock the number of shares of Capital Stock or other securities or property of the Company to which a holder of Common Stock would have been entitled on recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 6 with respect to the rights of the Holders after the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section 6 (including adjustment of the Conversion Number then in effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series C Convertible Preferred S tock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as may be practicable. 
   
 (h)  Mergers and Other Reorganizations. If at any time or from time to time there shall be a reclassification of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination, reclassification or exchange of shares provided for elsewhere in this Section 6) or a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another entity or the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's properties and assets to any other Person, then, as a part of and as a condition to the effectiveness of such reclassification, merger, consolidation or sale, lawful and adequate provision shall be made so that the Holders shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon conversion of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock the number of shares of Capital Stock or other securities or property, if any, of the Company or of the successor entity resulting from such reclassification, merger or consolidation or sale, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would have been entitled in connection with such reclassification, merger, consolidation or sale. In any such case, appropriate provision shall be made with respect to the rights of the Holders after the reclassification, merger, consolidation or sale to the end that the provisions of this Section 6 (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustment of the Conversion Number and the number of shares purchasable upon conversion of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be, with respect to any shares of Capital Stock, securities or property to be deliverable thereafter upon the conversion of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock. 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 19 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
   
Each Holder, upon the occurrence of a reclassification, merger or consolidation of the Company or the sale of all or substantially all its assets and properties, as such events are more fully set forth in the first paragraph of this Section 6(h), shall have the option of electing treatment of its shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock under either this Section 6(h) or Section 5 hereof, notice of which election shall be submitted in writing to the Company at its principal offices no later than ten (10) days before the effective date of such event, provided that any such notice of election shall be effective if given not later than fifteen (15) days after the date of the Company's notice pursuant to Section 6(i) hereof with respect to such event, and, provided, further, that if any Holder fails to give the Company such notice of election, the provisions of this Section 6(h) shall govern the treatment of such Holder's shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of such event. 
   
 (i)  Issuances of Common Stock .  If the Company, prior to the fifth (5 th) anniversary of the issuance of the first share of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock issues shares of Common Stock (but not upon the issuance of Common Stock Equivalents) either (i) upon the conversion or exercise of any instrument currently or hereafter issued (but not upon the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock), (ii) upon the exchange of debt for shares of common stock or (iii) in a private placement (a "Dilutive Issuance"), then the Conversion Number shall be adjusted to equal then the Conversion Number shall be adjusted to equal the sum of the amounts created by each individual Dilutive Issuance, wherein for each Dilutive Issuance the amount is determined from the result of: 
 
 
 
 1)   
 
The Product of  the number of shares of Common Stock owned by the Eligible Series C Preferred Holder upon the issuance of the first share of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock  divided by the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding upon the issuance of the first share of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock; 
 
 
 
 
 2)   
 
 Then this Product  Multiplied by  the individual Dilutive Issuance; 
 
 
   
 
 
 3)   
 
 Then this Product  Divided by  the Amount Created When The Percentage Created in Step One is  Subtracted from  100 percent; 
 
 
 
 
 
 4)   
 
 Then this Product  Divided by  the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock then outstanding. 
 
 
   
 (j)  Notices of Record Date. In the event (i) the Company fixes a record date to determine the holders of Common Stock who are entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution, or (ii) there occurs any capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification or recapitalization of the Common Stock of the Company, any merger or consolidation of the Company, or any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company, the Company shall mail to each Holder at least ten (10) days prior to the record date specified therein, a notice specifying (a) the date of such record date for the purpose of such dividend or distribution and a description of such dividend or distribution, (b) the date on which any such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, dissolution, liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and (c) the time, if any, that is to be fixed, as to when the holders of record of Common Stock (or other securities) shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock or other securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 20

 (l)  Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments. In lieu of any fractional shares to which a Holder would otherwise be entitled upon conversion, the Company shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the Market Price of one share of Common Stock, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Whether or not fractional shares are issuable upon such conversion shall be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock of each Holder at the time converting into Common Stock and the number of shares of Common Stock issuable  upon such aggregate conversion. 
   
Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Number of any share of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 6, the Company, at its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each Holder a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based.
