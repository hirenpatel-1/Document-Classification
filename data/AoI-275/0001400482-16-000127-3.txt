 SECTION 1. OFFICES 
 
The principal office of the corporation shall be located at the principal place of business or such other place as the Board of Directors   (" Board '')  may designate. The corporation may have such other offices as the Board may designate or as the business of the corporation may require. 
 
 SECTION 2. SHAREHOLDERS 
 
 2.1    Annual Meeting 
 
The annual meeting of the shareholders to elect Directors and transact such other business as may properly come before the meeting shall be held on a date not more than 180 days af ter the end of the corporation's fiscal year, such date and time to be determined by the Board. 
 
 2.2    Special Meetings 
 
The Chairman of the Board, the President or the Board may call special meetings of the shareholders for any purpose. Further, a special meeting of the shareholders shall be held if the holders of not less than 10% of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at such special meeting have dated, signed and delivered to the Secretary one or more written demands for such meeting, describing the purpose or purposes for which it is to be held. Such written demands to the Secretary of the corporation shall be accompanied by a notice setting forth the information required by Section 2.3.1 as to the business proposed to be conducted and any nominationsÂ· proposed to be presented at such meeting and as to the shareholder(s) proposing such business or nominations, and by a representation by the shareholder(s) that within five business days after the record date for any such meeting it will provide such information as of the record date for such meeting. A special meeting demanded by shareholders shall be held at such date, time and place within or without the State of Washington as may be fixed by the Board; provided, however, that the date of any such special meeting shall not be more than 90 days after a demand that complies with this Section 2.2 to call the special meeting is received by the Secretary of the corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a special meeting demanded by shareholders shall not be held if either (a) the Board has called or calls for an annual meeting of shareholders to be held within 90 days after the Secretary of the corporation receives the request for the special meeting and the Board determines in good faith that the business of such annual meeting includes (among any other matters properly brought before the annual meeting) the business specified in the demand or (b) an annual or special meeting that included the business specified in the demand (as determined in good faith by the Board) was held not more than 90 days before the demand to call the special meeting was received by the Secretary of the corporation. A shareholder may revoke a demand for a special meeting at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary of the corporation, and if such revoking shareholder had joined with other shareholders to submit the demand for a special meeting pursuant to this Section 2.2, and if the remaining unrevoked demands from shareholders joining in such request represent less than the requisite number of shares entitling the shareholders to request the calling of a special meeting, the Board, in its discretion, may refrain from calling the special meeting or cancel the special meeting, as the case may be. Business transacted at a special meeting demanded by shareholders shall be limited to the purpose(s) stated in the demand for meeting, provided, however, that the Board shall have the authority in its discretion to submit additional matters to the shareholders, and to cause other business to be transacted, at any special meeting demanded by shareho lders provided such matters are stated in the corporation's notice of such meeting. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2.3    Business Conducted at a Meeting 
 
 2.3.1 Annual Meetings of Shareholders 
 
At an annual meeting of shareholders, an item of business may be conducted, and a proposal may be considered and acted upon, only if such item or proposal is brought before the meeting (i) by, or at the direction of, the Board, or (ii) by any shareholder of the corporation who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the procedures set forth in the remainder of this Section 2.3.1. This Section 2.3 shall not apply to matters of procedure that are subject to the authority of the chairman of the meeting. 
 
For nominations or another item of business or proposal to be brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation and such other item of business or proposal must otherwise be a proper matter for shareholder action. To be timely, a shareholder's notice must be delivered to, or mailed and received at, the principal office of the corporation (i) not less than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date that the corporation's proxy statement was first released to shareholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting; (ii) a reasonable time before the corporation begins to print and mail its proxy materials if the date of the current year's annual meeting has been changed by more than 30 days from the date of the previous year's meeting; or (iii) not more than seven days following the mailing to shareholders of the notice of annual meeting with respect to the current year's annual meeting, if the corporation did not release a proxy statement to shareholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting, or if no annual meeting was held during such year. 
 
A shareholder's notice to the secretary under Section 2.3 shall set forth, (i) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected; (ii) as to each item of business or proposal the shareholder intends to bring before the meeting (a) a brief description of the item of business or proposal and the reasons for bringing it before the meeting, (b) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation's books, of the shareholder and of any other shareholders that the shareholder knows or anticipates will support the item of business or proposal, (c) the number and class of shares of stock of the corporation that are beneficially owned on the date of such notice by the shareholder and by any such other shareholders, and (d) any material financial or other interest of the shareholder (or any such other shareholders) in such item of business or proposal and/or the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (iii) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made, (x) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the corporation's books, and of such  beneficial owner and 
(y) the class and number of shares of the corporation that are owned beneficially and held of record by such shareholder and such beneficial owner. 
 
The Board, or a designated committee thereof, may reject a shareholder's notice that is not timely given in accordance with the terms of Section 2.3. If the Board, or a designated committee thereof, determines that the information provided in a timely shareholder's notice does not satisfy the requirements of Section 2.3 in any material respect, the Secretary of the corporation shall notify the shareholder of the deficiency in the notice. The shareholder shall have an opportunity to cure the deficiency by providing additional information to the Secretary within such period of time, not to exceed five days from the date such deficiency notice is given to the shareholder, as the Board or such committee shall reasonably determine. If the deficiency is not cured within such period, or if the Board of Directors or such committee determines that the additional information provided by the shareholder, together with information previously provided, does not satisfy the requirements of Section 2.3 in any material respect, then the Board or such committee may reject the shar eholder's notice. 
 
      
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2.3.2 Special Meeting of Shareholders 
 
Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the corporation's notice of such meeting. Nominations of candidates for election as directors may be made at a special meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the corporation's notice of such meeting (i) by or at the direction of the Board or (ii) provided that the Board has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any shareholder of the corporation who is a shareholder of record at the time of giving of notice of the special meeting, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.3. In the event the corporation calls a special meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors, any such shareholder may nominate a candidate or candidates (as the case may be), for election to such position(s) as specified in the corporation's notice of meeting, if the shareholder's notice required by Section 2.3.1 shall be delivered to the Secretary of the corporation at the principal executive offices of the corporation not earlier than the I 20th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board to be elected at such meeting. 
 
 2.3.3 General 
 
Notwithstanding the procedures set forth in Section 2.3, if a shareholder proposes to nominate one or more candidates for election as directors or desires to bring another item of business or proposal before an annual meeting, and neither the Board nor any committee thereof has made a prior determination of whether the shareholder has complied with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.3 in connection with such nomination or other item of business or proposal, then the chairman of the meeting shall determine and declare at the meeting whether the shareholder has so complied. If the chairman determines that the shareholder has so complied, then the chairman shall so state and ballots shall be provided for use at the meeting with respect to such nomination or other item of business or proposal. If the chairman determines that the shareholder has not so complied, then, unless the chairman, in his or her sole and absolute discretion, determines to waive such compliance, the chairman shall state that the shareholder has not so complied and the nomination or other  item of business or proposal shall not be brought before the meeting. 
 
 2.4    Meetings by Communications Equipment 
 
Shareholders may participate in any meeting of the shareholders by any means of communication by which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other during the meeti ng. Participation by such means shall constitute presence in person at a meeting. 
 
 2.5    Date, Time and Place of Meeting 
 
Except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws, all meetings of shareholders, including those held pursuant to demand by shareholders, shall be held on such date and at such time and  place designated by or at the direction of the Board. 
 
 2.6    Notice of Meeting 
 
Written or electronic notice stating the place, day and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called shall be given by or at the direction of the Board, the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Secretary to each shareholder entitled to notice of or to vote at the meeting not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the meeting, except that notice of a meeting to act on an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation, a plan of merger or share exchange, the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of the corporation's assets other than in the regular course of business or the dissolution of the corporation shall be given not less than 20 or more than 60 days before such meeting to all shareholders of record, whether or not entitled to vote at such meeting. If an annualÂ·or special sha reholders' meeting is adjourned to a 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
different date, time or place, no notice of the new date, time or place is required if they are announced at the meeting before adjournment. If a new record date for the adjourned meeting is or must be fixed, notice of the adjourned meeting must be given to shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote as of the new record date. 
 
Such notice may be transmitted by mail, private carrier, personal delivery, telegraph, teletype or communications equipment that transmits a facsimile of the notice. If these forms of written notice are impractical in the view of the Board, the Chairman of the Board, the President or the Secretary, written notice may be transmitted by an advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of the corporation's principal office. If such notice is mailed, it is effective when deposited in the official government mail, first-class postage prepaid, properly addressed to the shareholder at such shareholder's address as it appears in the corporation's current record of shareholders. Notice given in any other manner is effective when dispatched to the shareholder's address, telephone number or other number appearing on the records of the corporation. Any notice given by publication i s effective five days after first publication. 
 
Notices to shareholders from the corporation may be provided in an electronic transmission which contains or is accompanied by information from which it can be reasonably verified that the transmission was authorized by the shareholder or by the shareholder's attorney-in-fact. Subject to contrary provisions in the Washington Business Corporation Act, notice to shareholders in an electronic transmission shall be effective only with respect to shareholders that have consented, in the form of a record, to receive electronically transmitted notices and that have designated in the consent the address, location, or system to which these notices may be electronically transmitted and with respect to a notice that otherwise complies with any other requirements of the Washington Business Corporation Act and any applicable federal law. A shareholder who has consented to receipt of electronically transmitted notices may revoke this consent by delivering a revocation to the corporation in the form of a record. The consent of any shareholder is revoked if (a) the corporation is unable to electronically transmit two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with the consent, and (b) this inability becomes known to the Secretary, the transfer agent, or any other person responsible for giving the notice. The inadvertent failure by the corporation to treat this inability as a revocation does not invalidate any meeting  or other action. 
 
 2.7    Waiver of Notice 
 
Whenever any notice is required to be given to any shareholder under the provisions of these Bylaws, the Articles of Incorporation or the Washington Business Corporation Act, a waiver of notice in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice and delivered to the corporation, whether before or after the date and time of the meeting or before or after the action to be taken by consent is effective, shall be the equivalent of the giving of such notice. Further, notice of the time, place and purpose of any meeting will be waived by any shareholder by attendance in person or by proxy, unless such shareholder at the beginning of the meeting objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at  the meeting. 
 
 2.8    Fixing of Record Date for Determining Shareholders 
 
For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled (a) to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, (b) to demand a special meeting, or (c) to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other purpose, the Board may fix a future date as the record date for any such determination. Such record date shall be not more than 70 days, and, in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than 10 days, prior to the date on which the particular action requiring such determination is to be taken. If no record date is fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting, the record date shall be the day immediately preceding the date on which notice of the meeting is first given to shareholders. Such a determination shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the Board fixes a new record date, which it shall do if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting. If no record date is set for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive payment of any stock dividend or distribution (other than one involving a purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of the corporation's shares) the record date shall be the date the Board authorizes the stock dividend or distribution. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2.9    Voting Record 
 
At least 10 days before each meeting of shareholders, an alphabetical list of the shareholders entitled to notice of such meeting shall be made, arranged by voting group and by each class or series of shares, with the address of and number of shares held by each shareholder. This record shall be kept at the principal office of the corporation for 10 days prior to such meeting, and shall be kept open at such meeting, for the inspection of any shareholder or any shareholder's agent or attorney. Failure to comply with the requirements of  this Section shall not affect the validity of any action taken at the meeting. 
 
 2.10    Quorum 
 
A majority of the votes entitled to be cast on a matter by the holders of shares that, pursuant to the Articles of Incorporation or the Washington Business Corporation Act, are entitled to vote and be counted collectively upon such matter, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum of such shares at a meeting of shareholders. If less than a majority of such votes are represented at a meeting, a majority of the votes so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time. Any business may be transacted at a reconvened meeting that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called, provided a quorum is present or represented at such meeting. At a reconvened meeting at which a quorum is present any business may be transacted at the meeting as may have been brought at the adjourned meeting. If a meeting is adjourned to a different date, time, or place, notice need not be given of the new date, time, or place if a new date, time, or place is announced at the meeting before adjournment; however, if the Washington Business Corporation Act requires that a new record date for the adjourned meeting must be fixed, then notice of the adjourned meeting must be given to persons who are shareholders as of the new record date. In the case of any meeting of shareholders that is adjourned more than once_ because of the failure of a quorum to attend, those who attend the third convening of such meeting, although less than a quorum, shall nevertheless constitute a quorum for the purpose of electing directors, provided that the percentage of shares represented at the third convening of such meeting shall not be less than one-third of the shares entitled to vote. Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting other than solely to object to holding the meeting or transacting business, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and any adjournment (unless a new record date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting) notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. 
 
 2.11    Manner of Acting 
 
If a quorum is present, action on a matter other than the election of Directors shall be approved if the votes cast in favor of the action by the shares entitled to vote and be counted collectively upon such matter exceed the votes cast against such action by the shares entitled to vote and be counted collectively thereon, unless the Articles of lncorporatio n or the Washington Business Corporation Act requires a greater number of affirmative votes. 
 
 2.12    Proxies 
 
A shareholder may vote by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by his or her attorney-in-fact or agent. Such proxy shall be effective when received by the Secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes. A proxy shall become invalid 11 months after the date of its execution, unless otherwise provided in the proxy. A proxy with respect to a specified meeting shall entitle its holder to vote at any reconvened meeting following adjournment of such meeting but shall not be valid after the final adjournment. 
 
 2.13    Voting of Shares 
 
Except as provided in the Articles of Incorporation, each outstanding share entitled to vote with respect to a matter submitted to a meeting of shareholders shall be entitled to on e vote upon such matter. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2.14    Voting for Directors 
 
Each shareholder entitled to vote at an election of Directors may vote, in person or by proxy, the number of shares owned by such shareholder for as many persons as there are Directors to be elected and for whose election such shareholder has a right to vote. Unless otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, the candidates elected shall be those re ceiving the largest number of votes cast, up to the number of Directors to be elected.

 3.1    General Powers

Unless a Director dies, resigns, or is removed, his or her term of office shall expire at the next annual meeting of shareholders; provided, however, that a Director shall continue to serve until his or her successor is elected or until there is a decrease in the authorized number of Directors. Directors need not be shareholders of the corporation or residents of the st ate of Washington and need not meet any other qualifications. 
 
 3.3    Annual and Regular Meetings 
 
An annual Board meeting shall be held without notice immediately after and at the same place as the annual meeting of shareholders. By resolution the Board, or any committee designated by the Board, may specify the time and place for holding regular meetings without notice other than such resolution. 
 
 3.4    Special Meetings 
 
Special meetings of the Board or any committee designated by the Board may be called by or at the request of the Chairman of the Board, the President, the Secretary or, in the case of special Board meetings, any two Directors and, in the case of any special meeting of any committee designated by the Board, by its Chairman. The person or persons authorized to call special meetings may fix any place for holding any special Board or committee meeting called by them. 
 
 3.5    Meetings by Communications Equipment 
 
Members of the Board or any committee designated by the Board may participate in a meeting of such Board or committee by, or conduct the meeting through the use of, any means of communication by which all Directors participating in the meeting can hear each other during the meeting.

Notice of a special Board or committee meeting stating the place, day and hour of the meeting shall be given to a Director in writing, electronically or orally, as provided below.

 3.6.7    Electronic Transmission 
 
Notice may be provided in an electronic transmission which contains or is accompanied by information from which it can be reasonably verified that the transmission was authorized by the Director. Subject to contrary provisions in the Washington Business Corporation Act, notice to Directors in an electronic transmission shall be effective only with respect to Directors that have consented, in the form of a record, to receive electronically transmitted notices and that have designated in the consent the address, location, or system to which these notices may be electronically transmitted and with respect to a notice that otherwise complies with any other requirements of the Washington Business Corporation Act and any applicable federal law. A Director who has consented to receipt of electronically transmitted notices may revoke this consent by delivering a revocation to the corporation in the form of a record. The consent of any Director is revoked if (a) the corporation is unable to electronically transmit two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with the consent, and (b) this inability becomes known to the Secretary, the transfer agent, or any other person responsible for giving the notice. The inadvertent failure by the corporation to treat this inability as a revocation does not invalidate any meeting or other action. 
 
 3.6.8    Posting Electronic Notice 
 
Notice may be provided to Directors who have consented to receipt of electronically transmitted notices by posting

Notice is effective when it has been posted to an electronic network and a separate record of the p osting has been delivered to the recipient as provided by this Section 3.6.8. 
 
 3.7    Waiver of Notice 
 
 3.7.1    In Writing 
 
Whenever any notice is required to be given to any Director under the provisions of these Bylaws, the Articles of lncorporation or the Washington Business Corporation Act, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice and delivered to the corporation, whether before or after the date and time of the meeting, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of the Board or any committee designated by  the Board need be specified in the waiver of notice of such meeting. 
 
 3.7.2 By Attendance

Directors or by each committee member either before or after the action is taken and delivered to the corporation.
