 ARTICLE 9 
 INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS 
   
 Section 9.1.    Indemnity .  The Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to any person who was or is a party to or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including a grand jury proceeding) and whether formal or informal, by reason of the fact that such person (a) is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or (b) while a director, officer, or employee of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, agent, partner or trustee (or in a similar capacity) of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise, or employee benefit plan, to the maximum extent it is empowered to indemnify and advance expenses to a director by Part E of Division VIII of the Iowa Business Corporation Act as the same exists or may hereafter be amended or changed (but, in the case of any such amendment or change, only to the extent that such amendment or change empowers the Corporation to provide broader indemnification than said law empowered the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment or change), against reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, penalties, including an excise tax assessed with respect to an employee benefit plan, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such claim, action, suit or proceeding or any appeal thereof; provided, however, that except as provided in section 9.2 of these bylaws with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights of indemnification, entitlement to such indemnification shall be conditional upon the Corporation being afforded the opportunity to participate directly on behalf of such person in such claim, action, suit or proceeding or any settlement discussions relating thereto, and with respect to any settlement or other non-adjudicated disposition of any threatened or pending claim, action, suit or proceeding, entitlement to indemnification shall be further conditional upon the prior approval by the Corporation of the proposed settlement or nonadjudicated disposition.  Such approval shall be made (a) by the board of directors by majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors not at the time parties to the claim, action, suit or proceeding, or (b) by special legal counsel selected by the board of directors by majority vote, of a quorum consisting of directors not at the time parties to the claim, action or proceeding, or, if the requisite quorum of the full board cannot be obtained therefor, by a majority vote of the full board, in which selection of counsel directors who are parties may participate.  Approval or disapproval by the Corporation of any proposed settlement or other nonadjudicated disposition shall not subject the Corporation to any liability to or require indemnification or reimbursement of any party whom the Corporation would not otherwise have been required to indemnify or reimburse.  The right to indemnification conferred in this Article shall include the right to payment or reimbursement by the Corporation of reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any such claim, action, suit or proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that the payment or reimbursement of such expenses in advance of the final disposition of such claim, action, suit or proceeding shall be made only upon (a) delivery to the Corporation of a written undertaking, by or on behalf of the person claiming indemnification under this Article to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article or otherwise, or (b) delivery to the Corporation of a written affirmation of such person's good faith belief that such person has met the applicable standard of conduct necessary to require indemnification by the Corporation pursuant to this Article or otherwise, or (c) a determination that the facts then known to those making the determination would not preclude indemnification un der this Article.     
   
 Section 9.2.    Payment .  Any indemnification or advancement of expenses required under this Article shall be made promptly upon, and in any event within thirty (30) days after, the written request of the person entitled thereto.  If the Corporation denies a written request for indemnity or advancement of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full pursuant to such request is not made within thirty (30) days of the date such request is received by the Corporation, the person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses as granted by this Article may at any time within the applicable statute of limitations bring suit against the Corporation in any court of competent jurisdiction to establish such person's right to indemnity or advancement of expenses.  Such person's costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or her right to indemnification in any such action or proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.  It shall be a defense to any action brought against the Corporation to compel indemnification (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advancement of expenses pursuant to this Article where the written affirmation of good faith or the undertaking to repay as required above has been received by the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct set forth in Section 490.851 of the Iowa Business Corporation Act, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation.  Neither (a) the failure of the Corporation (including its board of directors, special legal counsel or the shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 490.851 of the Iowa Business Corporation Act, nor (b) the fact that there has been an actual determination by the Corporation (including its board of directors, special legal counsel or the shareholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.  In the event that the applicable standard of conduct has been met as to some claims, actions, suits or proceedings, but not as to others, a person who has a right of indemnification pursuant to this Article shall be indemnified against all expenses (including attorney fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the claim, action, suit or proceeding as to which the applicable standard has been met.  Nothing contained in this section shall limit the obligation, duty or ability of the Co rporation to indemnify such person as provided elsewhere in this Article.     
   
 Section 9.3.    Contract .  The provisions of this Article shall be deemed a contract between the Corporation and each director and officer who serves in such capacity at any time while this Article and the relevant provisions of the Iowa Business Corporation Act are in effect, and any repeal or modification of any such law or of this Article shall not adversely affect any rights or obligations then existing with respect to any state of facts then or theretofore existing or any claim, action, suit or proceeding theretofore or thereafter brought or threatened  based in whole or in part upon any such state of facts. 
   
 Section 9.4.    Witnesses .  The Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to any person who was or is a witness in or is threatened to be made a witness in any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including a grand jury proceeding) and whether formal or informal, by reason of the fact that such person (a) is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or (b) while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, agent, partner or trustee (or in a similar capacity) of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise, or employee benefit plan, to the same extent that such person would be entitled to indemnification and advancement of expenses under this Article if such person were, or were threatened to be made, a party to such claim, action, suit or proceeding, against reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such c laim, action, suit or proceeding or any appeal thereof. 
   
 
   
   
 
   
 
   
 Section 9.5.    Nonexclusive .  Except as limited by section 490.851 of the Iowa Business Corporation Act, the indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise; provided, however, that in no event shall any such provision or agreement provide indemnification to a person who was or is a director or officer of the Corporation (a) for a breach of a director's or officer's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its shareholders, (b) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of the law, (c) for a transaction from which the person seeking indemnification derived an improper personal benefit or (d) for  liability under section 490.833 of the Iowa Business Corporation Act.     
   
 Section 9.6.    Applicability .  This Article shall be applicable to all claims, actions, suits or proceedings commenced after the effective date hereof, whether arising from acts or omissions occurring before or after the effective date hereof.  Each person who is now serving or who shall hereafter serve as a director or officer of the Corporation shall be deemed to be doing so in reliance upon the rights of indemnification provided for in this Article, and such rights of indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer, and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators and legal or personal representatives of such a person.  If this Article or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director and officer of the Corporation to the maximum extent per mitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated. 
   
 Section 9.7.    Initiation of Claims .  Notwithstanding anything in this Article to the contrary, except with respect to proceedings initiated to enforce rights of indemnification to which such person is entitled under this Article or otherwise, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person in connection with a claim, action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if the initiation of such claim, action, suit or proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of directors. 
   
 Section 9.8.    Insurance .  The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise, or employee benefit plan against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under the provisions of this Article, the Iowa Business Corporation Act or otherwise.  The Corporation may create a trust fund, grant a security interest and/or use other means (including, without limitation, letters of credit, surety bonds and/or similar arrangements), as well as enter into contracts providing for indemnification to the maximum extent permitted by law and including as part thereof any or all of the foregoing, to ensure the payment of such sums as may become necessary to effect full indemnification.  The Corporation's obligation to make indemnification and pay expenses pursuant to this Article shall be in excess of any insurance purchased and maintained by the Corporation and such insurance shall be primary.  To the extent that indemnity or expenses of a person entitled to indemnification and payment of expenses pursuant to this Article are paid on behalf of or to such person by such insurance such payments shall be deemed to be in satisfaction of the Corporation's obligation to such person to make indemnification and pay expenses pursuant to this Article.
