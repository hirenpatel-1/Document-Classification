(b) Subject to this Section 3(b) and other applicable provisions of these By-laws, a Special Meeting of Stockholders shall be called by the Secretary upon the written request (each such request, a "Special Meeting Request" and such meeting, a "Stockholder Requested Special Meeting") of one or more stockholders of record of the Corporation that together have continuously held, for their own account or on behalf of others, beneficial ownership of at least a twenty percent (20%) aggregate "net long position" of the capital stock issued and outstanding (the "Requisite Percentage") for at least one year prior to the date such request is delivered to the Corporation (such period, the "One-Year Period"). For purposes of determining the Requisite Percentage, "net long position" shall be determined with respect to each requesting holder in accordance with the definition thereof set forth in Rule 14e-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (as so amended and inclusive of such rules and regulations, the "Exchange Act" );   provided  that (x) for purposes of such definition, (A) "the date that a tender offer is first publicly announced or otherwise made known by the bidder to the holders of the security to be acquired" shall be the date of the relevant Special Meeting Request, (B) the "highest tender offer price or stated amount of the consideration offered for the subject security" shall refer to the closing sales price of capital stock on the New York Stock Exchange (or any successor thereto) on such date (or, if such date is not a trading day, the next succeeding trading day), (C) the "person whose securities are the subject of the offer" shall refer to the Corporation, and (D) a "subject security" shall refer to the outstanding capital stock; and (y) the net long position of such holder shall be reduced by the number of shares of capital stock as to which such holder does not, or will not, have the right to vote or direct the vote at the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting or as to which such holder has, at any time during the One-Year Period, entered into any derivative or other agreement, arrangement or understanding that hedges or transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, any of the economic consequences of ownership of such shares. Whether the requesting holders have complied with the requirements of this Section 3(b) and related provisions of these By-laws shall be determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or its designees, which determination shall be conclusive and binding on the Corporation and the stockholders. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (c)In order for a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting to be called, one or more Special Meeting Requests must be signed by the Requisite Percentage of stockholders submitting such request and by each of the beneficial owners, if any, on whose behalf the Special Meeting Request is being made and must be delivered to the Secretary. The Special Meeting Request(s) shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation by nationally recognized private overnight courier service, return receipt requested. Each Special Meeting Request shall (i) set forth a statement of the specific purpose(s) of the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at it, (ii) bear the date of signature of each such stockholder signing the Special Meeting Request, (iii) set forth (A) the name and address, as they appear in the Corporation's books, of each stockholder signing such request and the beneficial owners, if any, on whose behalf such request is made and (B) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation that are, directly or indirectly, owned of record or beneficially (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) by each such stockholder and the beneficial owners, if any, on whose behalf such request is made, (iv) set forth any material interest of each stockholder signing the Special Meeting Request in the business desired to be brought before the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, (v) include documentary evidence that the stockholders requesting the special meeting own the Requisite Percentage as of t he date on which the Special Meeting Request is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation;   provided, however, that if the stockholders are not the beneficial owners of the shares constituting all or part of the Requisite Percentage, then to be valid, the Special Meeting Request must also include documentary evidence (or, if not simultaneously provided with the Special Meeting Request, such documentary evidence must be delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation within ten (10) days after the date on which the Special Meeting Request is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation) that the beneficial owners on whose behalf the Special Meeting Request is made beneficially own such shares as of the date on which such Special Meeting Request is delivered to the Secretary, (vi) an agreement by each of the stockholders requesting the special meeting and each beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the Special Meeting Request is being made to notify the Corporation promptly in the event of any decrease in the net long position held by such stockholder or beneficial owner following the delivery of such Special Meeting Request and prior to the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting and an acknowledgement that any such decrease shall be deemed to be a revocation of such Special Meeting Request by such stockholder or beneficial owner to the extent of such reduction, (vii) contain any other information that would be required to be provided by a stockholder seeking to bring an item of business before an annual meeting of stockholders pursuant to Article II, Section 9 of these By-laws, and, (viii) if the purpose of the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting includes the election of one or more Directors, contain any other information that would be required to be set forth with respect to a proposed nominee pursuant to Article II, Section 8 of these By-laws. Each Stockholder making a Special Meeting Request and each beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the Special Meeting Request is being made is required to update such Special Meeting Request delivered pursuant to this Section 3 in accordance with the requirements of Article II, Sections 8 and 9 of these By-laws. Any requesting Stockholder may revoke his, her or its Special Meeting Request at any time prior to the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting by written revocation delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation. If at any time after sixty (60) days following the earliest dated Special Meeting Request, the unrevoked (whether by specific written revocation or by a reduction in the net long position held by such Stockholder, as described above) valid Special Meeting Requests represent in the aggregate less than the Requisite Percentage, there shall be no r equirement to hold a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting. 
 
 (d)In determining whether Special Meeting Requests have met the requirements of this Section 3, multiple Special Meeting Requests will be considered together only if (i) each Special Meeting Request identifies substantially the same purpose or purposes of the requested special meeting and substantially the same matters proposed to be acted on at the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting (in each case as determined in good faith by the Board), and (ii) such Special Meeting Requests have been delivered to the Secretary within 60 days of the delivery to the Secretary of the earliest dated Special Meeting Request relating to such item(s) of business. 
 
 (e)If none of the stockholders who submitted a Special Meeting Request appears or sends a qualified representative to present the item of business submitted by the stockholders for consideration at the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, such item of business shall not be submitted for vote of the stockholders at such Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation or such stockholder(s). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (f)Except as provided in the next sentence, a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall be held at such date, time and place within or without the State of Delaware as may be fixed  by the Board of Directors;   provided, however, that the date of any such Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall be not more than ninety (90) days after the date on which valid Special Meeting Request(s) constituting the Requisite Percent are delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation (such date of delivery being the " Delivery Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secretary of the Corporation shall not be required to call a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting if (i) the Board of Directors calls an annual meeting of stockholders, or a special meeting of stockholders at which a Similar Item (as defined in this Section 3(f)) is to be presented pursuant to the notice of such meeting, in either case to be held not later than sixty (60) days after the Delivery Date; (ii) the Delivery Date is during the period commencing ninety (90) days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting and ending on the earlier of (A) the date of the next annual meeting and (B) thirty (30) days after the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting; or (iii) the Special Meeting Request(s) (A) contain an identical or substantially similar item (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, a "Similar Item") to an item that was presented at any meeting of stockholders held not more than one hundred and twenty (120) days before the Delivery Date (and, for purposes of this clause (iii) the election of directors shall be deemed a "Similar Item" with respect to all items of business involving the election or removal of directors); (B) relate to an item of business that is not a proper subject for action by the stockholders under applicable law; (C) were made in a manner that involved a violation of Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act or other applicable law or would cause the Corporation to violate any law; or (D) do not comply with the provisions of this Section 3. The procedures set forth in this Section 3 are the exclusive means by which items of business may be raised by stockholders at a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting. 
(g)    Written notice of a special meeting stating the place, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called shall be given not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. Any notice relating to a special meeting appropriately called pursuant to this Section 3 shall describe the item or items of business to be considered at such special meeting. Business transacted at any special meeting shall be limited to the matters identified in the Corporation's notice given pursuant to this Section 3; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prohibit the Board of Directors from including in such notice and submitting to the Stoc kholders additional matters to be considered at any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting. 
 Section 4. Quorum.  Except as otherwise provided by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of a majority of the capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. If the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting. 
 Section 5. Voting.  Unless otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, all voting shall be conducted in accordance with this Section 5. Each stockholder represented at a meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to cast one vote for each share of the capital stock entitled to vote on the subject matter held by such stockholder or such other vote as set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation. Such votes may be cast in person or by proxy but no proxy shall be voted on or after three years from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. The Board of Directors, in its discretion, or the officer of the Corporation presiding at a meeting of stockholders, in such officer's discretion, m ay require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be cast by written ballot. 
 
In all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on  the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Each director shall be elected by the vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to that director's election at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. However, if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. A majority of votes cast in an election of directors shall mean that the number of votes cast "for" a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that director's election (with "abstentions" and "broker nonvotes" not counted as a vote cast either "for " or "against" that director's election). 
If a nominee for director, who is an incumbent director, is not elected, the director shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The Corporate Governance Committee, or such other committee designated by the Board of Directors, shall make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to whether to accept or reject the resignation of such incumbent director, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors shall act on the resignation, taking into account the committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the decision within 90 days following certification of the election results. The director who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the recommendation of the committee or the decision of the Board of Directors with respect to his or her resignation. If such incumbent director's resignation is not accepted by the Board of Directors, such director shall continue to serve until the next annual meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected or his or her earlier resignation or rem oval. 
If the Board of directors accepts a director's resignation pursuant to this Section 5, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, the Board of Directors may fill the resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Article III, Section 2 or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to the provision s of Article III, Section 1 of these By-Laws. 
 
 Section 6. List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote.  The officer of the Corporation who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, the list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder of the Corporation who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder of the Corporation during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and  the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. 
 Section 7. Stock Ledger.  The stock ledger of the Corporation shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders. 
 Section 8. Nomination of Directors.  Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as directors of the Corporation, except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation with respect to the right of holders of preferred stock of the Corporation to nominate and elect a specified number of directors i n certain circumstances. 
 
 (a)Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made by or at the direction of the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof) at any annual meeting of stockholders or any special meeting of stockholders (but only if the election of directors is a matter specified in the notice of meeting). 
 
 (b)Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may also be made at any annual or special (but only if the election of directors is a matter specified in the notice of meeting) meeting of stockholders by any stockholder of the Corporation (i) who is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 8(b) and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting and (ii) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 8(b). A stockholder may also nominate persons for election to the Board of Directors pursuant to a Special Meeting Request in accordance with the requirements set forth in Article II, Secti on 3.

Such notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a  director if elected. 
(c) The Corporation shall include in its proxy statement for an annual meeting of stockholders the name, together with the Required Information (as defined below), of any person nominated for election (the "Stockholder Nominee") to the Board of Directors by a stockholder that satisfies, or by a group of stockholders that satisfy, the requirements of this Section 8(c) (such individual or stockholder group, including each member thereof, to the extent the context so requires, the "Eligible Stockholder"), and who expressly elects at the time of providing the notice required by this Section 8(c) to have its nominee included in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to this Section 8(c). Any stockholder or group of stockholders seeking to nominate one or more Stockholder Nominees pursuant to this Section 8(c) shall provide the Corporation with the information called for by the final paragraph of Section 8(b) with respect to such Eligible Stockholder or group of stockholders and each such Stockholder Nominee, as applicable. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For purposes of this Section 8(c), the "Required Information" that the Corporation will include in its proxy statement is (i) the information concerning the Stockholder Nominee and the Eligible Stockholder that is required to be disclosed in the Corporation's proxy statement by the regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act; and (ii) if the Eligible Stoc kholder so elects, a Statement (defined below). 
The Corporation shall not be required to include, pursuant to this Section 8(c), any information concerning any Stockholder Nominee in its proxy statement for any meeting of stockholders (w) with respect to whom the Secretary of the Corporation receives a notice that a stockholder has nominated such person for election to the Board of Directors pursuant to the advance notice requirements for stockholder nominees for director set forth in Section 8(b), (x) who would cause the number of Stockholder Nominees included in the Corporation's proxy statement to exceed the maximum number permitted by this Section 8(c), (y) who is not independent under the listing standards of the principal U.S. exchange upon which the common stock of the Corporation is listed, any applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any publicly disclosed standards used by the Board of Directors in determining and disclosing the independence of the Corporation's directors (collectively, the "Independence Standards"), or (z) (A) whose election as a member of the Board of Directors would cause the Corporation to be in violation of these By-laws, the Corporation's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the rules and listing guidelines of the principal U.S. securities market in which the common stock of the Corporation trades or any other applicable state or federal law or regulation, (B) who has been an officer or director of a competitor, as defined in Section 8 of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, within the past three years, or (C) who is a named subject of a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses) or has been convicted in such a criminal proceeding within the past ten years. 
The Corporate Governance and Public Policy Committee shall determine if the Stockholder Nominee satisfies the Independence Standards based on the information regarding such independence of such Stockholder Nominee that is received by the Board of Directors. At the request of the Corporation, the Stockholder Nominee must complete and submit the questionnaires that are required of the Corporation's directors and officers. The Corporation may also request such additional information as is necessary to permit the Board of Directors to determine if each Stockholder Nominee satisfies the Independence Standards. The Corporate Governance and Public Policy Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit the Eligible Stockholder and/or the Stockholder Nominee and its or their representatives an opportunity to appear before such committee in connection with its consideration as to whether the Stockho lder Nominee satisfies the Independence Standards. 
If a Stockholder Nominee or an Eligible Stockholder fails to continue to meet the requirements of this Section 8(c) or if the Eligible Stockholder fails to meet the all of the requirements of the notice provisions set forth in the last paragraph of Section 8(b) to properly nominate a candidate for election as a director at the annual meeting of stockholders or if a Stockholder Nominee dies, becomes disabled or is otherwise disqualified from being nominated for election or serving as a director prior to the annual meeting of stockholde rs: 
 
 (i)The Corporation may, to the extent feasible, remove the name of the Stockholder Nominee and the Statement from its proxy statement, remove the name of the Stockholder Nominee from its form of proxy and/or otherwise communicate to its stockholders that the Stockholder Nominee will not be eligible for nomination at the annual meeting of stockholders; and 
 (ii)The Eligible Stockholder may not name another Stockholder Nominee or, subsequent to the last day on which a stockholder's notice of an intent to make a nomination would be timely, otherwise cure in any way any defect preventing the nomination of the Stockholder Nominee at the annual meeting of stockholders. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The number of Stockholder Nominees (including Stockholder Nominees that were submitted by an Eligible Stockholder for inclusion in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to this Section 8(c) but either are subsequently withdrawn or that the Board of Directors decides to nominate as Board of Director nominees) appearing in the Corporation's proxy statement with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders shall not exceed 20% of the number of directors in office as of the last day on which notice of a nomination in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 8(c) may be delivered pursuant to this Section 8(c), or if such amount is not a whole number, the closest whole number below 20%. In the event that the number of Stockholder Nominees submitted by Eligible Stockholders pursuant to this Section 8(c) exceeds this maximum number, each Eligible Stockholder will select one Stockholder Nominee for inclusion in the Corporation's proxy statement until the maximum number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of common stock of the Corporation each Eligible Stockholder disclosed as owned in the written notice of the nomination submitted to the Corporation. If the maximum number is not reached after each Eligible Stockholder has selected one Stockholder Nominee, this selection process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the max imum number is reached. 
For purposes of this Section 8(c), an Eligible Stockholder shall be deemed to "own" only those outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation as to which the stockholder possesses both (i) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the shares and (ii) the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit and risk of loss on) such shares; provided that the number of shares calculated in accordance with clauses (i) and (ii) shall not include any shares (x) sold by such stockholder or any of its affiliates in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, (y) borrowed by such stockholder or any of its affiliates for any purposes or purchased by such stockholder or any of its affiliates pursuant to an agreement to resell or (z) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative or similar agreement entered into by such stockholder or any of its affiliates, whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of shares of outstanding common stock of the Corporation, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, the purpose or effect of (1) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, such stockholder's or affiliates' full right to vote or direct the voting of any such shares, and/or (2) hedging, offsetting or altering to any degree gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such shares by such stockholder or affiliate. A stockholder shall "own" shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the stockholder retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. A stockholder's ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the stockholder has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney or other instrument or arrangement which is revocable at any time by the stockholder. The terms "owned," "owning" and other variations of the word "own" shall have correlative meanings. Whether outstanding shares of the common stock of the Corporation are "owned" for these purposes shall be determined by the Board of Directors.

 Section 4. Indemnity if Successful on the Merits.  The Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnitee if such Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such Indemnite e in connection therewith.

Any indemnification under this Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Article VIII. Such determination shall be made with respect to a person who is an Indemnitee at the time of such determination (i) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (ii) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iv) by majority vote of the stockholders. The exercise of the power to indemnify and advance expenses by the Corporation pursuant to this Article VIII shall not be deemed to limit any other exercise or restriction of such powers by the Corporation, provided, that any repeal or modification of this Article VIII shall not adversely affect any right or protection of any Indemnitee in respect to any act or omission occurring prior to the  time of such repeal or modification. 
 Section 6. Indemnification by a Court.  Notwithstanding any contrary determination or absence of determination in a specific case under Section 5 of this Article VIII, any Indemnitee may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 1, 2 and 4 of this Article VIII. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because such Indemnitee has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Section 1, 2 or 4 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination nor the absence of a determination in a specific case under Section 5 of this Article VIII shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the Indemnitee seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Section 7. Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses.  The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to this Article VIII shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be an Indemnitee and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such Indemnitee. No repeal, modification or amendment of, or adoption of any provision inconsistent with, this Article VIII, nor to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any modification of law, shall adversely affect any right or protection of any person granted pursuant hereto existing at, or with respect to, arising out of or related to any event, act or omission that occurred prior to, the time of such repeal, modification, amendment or adoption (regardless of when any proceeding (or part thereof) relating to such event, act or omission arises or is first threatened, commenced or  completed.) 
 Section 8. Applicable Law.  The rights granted under this Article VIII shall be limited to the extent any applicable laws limit such rights to indemnity or the power to indemnify. 
 Section 9. Certain Definitions.   For purposes of this Article VIII the following definitions shall apply. 
"Acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal action, suit or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe their conduct was unlawful" shall include, but not be limited to, actions based on the following information from the Corporation or other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or enterprise to which the Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Corporation (for purposes of this definition only, an "Enterprise"): records or books of account of the Corporation or Enterprise, information supplied by an officer of the Corporation or Enterprise in the course of their duties, advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or Enterprise, or information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or Enterprise by an independent certified public accountant, appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or Enterprise.

Unless a majority of the Board of Directors, acting on behalf of the Corporation, consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum (which consent may be given at any time, including during the pendency of litigation), the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state court located within the State of Delaware or, if no court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Corporation to the Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any of its directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Corporation's Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws (in each case, as may be amended from time to time) or (d) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any of its directors, officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware, in all cases subject to the court's having personal jurisdiction over all indispensable parties named as defendants; provided that this Section 1 of Article IX shall not apply with respect to any litigation that has been filed as of February 19, 2016. 
   
 Section 2. Personal Jurisdiction. If any action the subject matter of which is within the scope of the immediately preceding section is filed in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a "Foreign Action") in the name of any stockholder, such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to (a) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the immediately preceding section (an "Enforcement Action") and (b) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such Enforcement Action by service upon such stockholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such stockholder.

If any provision of this Article IX shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to any person, entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever, then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the validity, legality and enforceability of such provision in any other circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Article IX, and the application of such provision to other persons or entities and circumstances shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
