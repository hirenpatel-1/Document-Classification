 (b)  Shareholder Requested Special Meetings. (1) Any shareholder of record seeking to have shareholders request a special meeting shall, by sending written notice to the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer (the "Record Date Request Notice") by registered mail, return receipt requested, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date to determine the shareholders entitled to request that a special meeting be called (the "Request Record Date") which request shall be in proper form and shall be delivered to, or mailed and received by, the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer. To be in proper form for purposes of this Section 3.2, the Record Date Request Notice (i) shall set forth the purpose or purposes of the special meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at it, the reasons for conducting such matters at the special meeting and any material interest in such matters of each Requesting Person, (ii) shall set forth a reasonably detailed description of all agreements, arrangements and understandings (A) between or among any of the Requesting Persons or (B) between or among any Requesting Person and any other person or entity (including their names) in connection with the request for the special meeting or the business proposed to be conducted at the special meeting, (iii) shall be signed by one or more shareholders of record as of the date of signature, (iv) shall bear the date of signature of each such shareholder, and (v) shall set forth for each Requesting Person all information required to be provided pursuant to Section 3.13(c) for a Proposing Person except that for purposes of this Section 3.2 the term "Requesting Person" shall be substituted for the term "Proposing Person" in all places where it appears in Section 3.13(c). Upon receiving the Record Date Request Notice in proper form and otherwise in compliance with this Section 3.2 from any shareholder of record, the Board of Directors may fix a Request Record Date. The Request Record Date shall not precede and shall not be more than ten (10) days after the close of business on the date on which the resolution fixing the Request Record Date is adopted by the Board of Directors. If the Board of Directors, within ten (10) days after the date on which a valid Record Date Request Notice is received, fails to adopt a resolution fixing the Request Record Date, the Request Record Date shall be the close of business on the tenth day after the first date on which the Record Date Request Notice is received by the Chief Executive Of ficer or Chief Financial Officer. 
(2) In order for any shareholder to request that a special meeting be called, one or more written requests for a special meeting in proper form (the "Special Meeting Request") signed by shareholders of record as of the Request Record Date who are entitled to cast not less than ten percent (10%) of all of the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting (the "Special Meeting Percentage") shall be timely delivered in proper form to the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer. Only shareholders of record on the record date shall be entitled to request that the Corporation call a special meeting of the shareholders pursuant to this Section 3.2. To be in proper form for purposes of this Section 3.2, the Special Meeting Request (a) shall set forth the purpose of the meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at it (which shall be limited to those lawful matters set forth in the Record Date Request Notice received by the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer), (b) shall include the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration), (c) shall bear the date of signature of each such shareholder (or such agent) signing the Special Meeting Request, and (d) shall set forth for each shareholder requesting that a special meeting be called (other than any shareholder that has provided such request in response to a solicitation made pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act by way of a solicitation statement filed on Schedule 14A), the information required to be provided pursuant to this Section 3.2 of a Requesting Person. To be timely, the Special Meeting Request shall be sent to the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer by registered mail, return receipt requested, and shall be received by the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer within sixty (60) days after the Request Record Date. Any requesting shareholder (or agent duly authorized in a writing accompanying the revocation or the Special Meeting Request) may revoke his, her or its request for a special meeting at any time by written revocation delivered t o the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer. 
(3) Except as provided in the next sentence, any special meeting shall be held at such place, date and time as may be designated by the person or persons who have called such meeting pursuant to Section 3.2(a). In the case of any special meeting called by the Board of Directors upon the request of shareholders (a "Shareholder Requested Meeting"), such meeting shall be held at such place, date and time as may be designated by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that the date of any Shareholder Requested Meeting shall be not more than ninety (90) days after the record date for such meeting (the "Meeting Record Date"); and provided further that if the Board of Directors fails to designate, within ten (10) days after the date that a valid Special Meeting Request is actually received by the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer (the "Delivery Date"), a date and time for a Shareholder Requested Meeting, then such meeting shall be held at 2:00 p.m. local time on the 90th day after the Meeting Record Date or, if such 90th day is not a Business Day (as defined below), on the first preceding Business Day; and provided further that in the event that the Board of Directors fails to designate a place for a Shareholder

Requested Meeting within ten (10) days after the Delivery Date, then such meeting shall be held at the principal executive office of the Corporation. In fixing a date for any special meeting, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or Board of Directors may consider such factors as he, she or it deems relevant within the good faith exercise of business judgment, including, without limitation, the nature of the matters to be considered, the facts and circumstances surrounding any request for the meeting and any plan of the Board of Directors to call an annual meeting or a special meeting. In the case of any Shareholder Requested Special Meeting, if the Board of Directors fails to fix a Meeting Record Date that is a date within thirty (30) days after the Delivery Date, then the close of business on the 30th day after the Delivery Date shall be the Meeting Record Date. Notwithstanding anything in these By-laws to the contrary, the board of directors may submit its own proposal or proposals for consideration at any Shareholder Requested Special Meeting. 
(4) If at any time as a result of written revocations of the Special Meeting Request, shareholders of record, as of the Request Record Date, entitled to cast less than the Special Meeting Percentage shall have delivered and not revoked requests for a special meeting, the officer or agent of the Corporation empowered to give notice of the meeting, shall refrain from mailing such notice or, if such notice has been mailed, such officer or agent shall revoke the notice of the meeting at any time at least ten (10) days before the meeting if the officer or agent of the Corporation has first sent to all other requesting shareholders written notice of such revocation and of the officer's or agent's intention to revoke the notice of the meeting. Any request for a special meeting received after a revocation by such officer or agent of a notice of a meeting shall be considered a request for a new s pecial meeting.

For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no such purported request shall be deemed to have been delivered to the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer until the earlier of (i) five (5) Business Days after receipt by the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of such purported request and (ii) such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Corporation that the valid requests received by the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer represent, as of the Request Record Date, shareholders of record entitled to cast not less than the Special Meeting Percentage of the votes that would be entitled to be cast at such meeting. Nothing contained in this paragraph (5) shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Corporation or any shareholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any request, whether during or after such five (5) Business Day period, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation). 
(6) For purposes of this Section 3.2, the term "Requesting Person" shall mean (i) the shareholder making the request to fix a record date for the purpose of determining the shareholders entitled to request that the special meeting be called, (ii) the beneficial owner or beneficial owners, if different, on whose behalf such request is made, (iii) any affiliate or associate of such shareholder or beneficial owner, and (iv) any other person with whom such shareholder or beneficial owner (or any of their respective affiliates or associate s) is Acting in Concert. 
(7) For purposes of these By-laws, a person shall be deemed to be "Acting in Concert" with another person if such person knowingly acts (whether or not pursuant to an express agreement, arrangement or understanding) in concert with, or towards a common goal relating to the management, governance or control of the corporation in parallel with, such other person where (i) each person is conscious of the other person's conduct or intent and this awareness is an element in their decision-making processes and (ii) at least one additional factor suggests that such persons intend to act in concert or in parallel, which such additional factors may include, without limitation, exchanging information (whether publicly or privately), attending meetings, conducting discussions, or making or soliciting invitations to act in concert or in parallel; provided, that a person shall not be deemed to be Acting in Concert with any other person solely as a result of the solicitation or receipt of revocable proxies or consents from such other person in response to a solicitation made pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act by way of a proxy or consent solicitation statement filed on Schedule 14A. A person Acting in Concert with another person shall be deemed to be Acting in Concert with any third party who is also Acting in Concert with such other person.

(d) The Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer shall not accept, and shall consider ineffective, a written request from a shareholder to call a special meeting (i) that does not comply with this Section 3.2, (ii) that relates to an item of business to be transacted at such meeting that is not a proper subject for shareholder action under applicable law, (iii) that includes an item of business to be transacted at such meeting that did not appear on the written request that resulted in the determination of the record date (the "Current Record Date") to determine the shareholders entitled to submit such written demand, (iv) that relates to an item of business that is identical or substantially similar to an item of business (a "Similar Item") for which a record date (other than the Current Record Date) was previously fixed and such demand is delivered between the time beginning on the day after such previous record date and ending on the one-year anniversary of such previous record date (and, for purposes of this paragraph (d), the election of directors shall be deemed a "Similar Item" with respect to all items of business involving the election or removal of directors), (v) if a Similar Item will be submitted for shareholder approval at any shareholder meeting to be held on or before the date that is one hundred twenty days (120) after the secretary receives such demand, (vi) if a Similar Item has been presented at the most recent annual meeting or at any special meeting held within one year prior to receipt by the secretary of such demand to call a special meeting, (vi) a Similar Item is included in the Corporation's notice as an item of business to be brought before a shareholder meeting that has been called but not yet held; or (v) such special meeting demand was made in a manner that involved a violation of Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act or other applicable law. 
(e) Notwithstanding anything in these By-laws to the contrary, the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer shall not be required to call a special meeting except in accordance with this Section 3.2. If the board of directors shall determine that any request to fix a record date or demand to call and hold a special meeting was not properly made in accordance with this Section 3.2, or shall determine that the shareholder or shareholders requesting that the board of directors fix such record date or submitting a demand to call the special meeting have not otherwise complied with this Section 3.2, then the board of directors shall not be required to fix a record date or to call and hold the special meeting. In addition to the requirements of this Section 3.2, each Requesting Person shall comply with all requirements of applicable law, including all requirements of the Exchange Act , with respect to any request to fix a record date or demand to call a special meeting. 
 3.3  Quorum. Business may be transacted at any duly held meeting of the shareholders at which a quorum is present. The holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote at a meeting are a quorum. The shareholders present at the meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, even though a number of shareholders withdraw leaving less than a quorum. If a quorum is not present at any meeting, those shareholders present have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time until the requisite number of voting shares are present. The date, time and place of the reconvened meeting shall be announced at the time of adjournment and notice of the reconvened meeting shall be given to all shareholders who were not present at the time of adjournment. Any business which might have been transacted at the meeting which was adjourned may be transacted at the reconvened meeting .

A shareholder may waive notice of the meeting orally or in writing. In addition, mere attendance by a shareholder at a meeting of the shareholders also constitutes a waiver of notice of such meeting, unless the shareholder objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of business because the meeting allegedly is not lawfully called or convened, or objects before a vote on an item of business because the item may not lawfully be considered at that meeting and does not thereafter participate in  the consideration of the item at that meeting.

The Board of Directors may close the stack transfer books for a period of time which does not exceed sixty (60) days preceding any of the following: the date of any meeting of shareholders; the payment of dividends; the allotment of rights; or the change, conversion, or exchange of shares. 
 3.9  Record Date.

If the share transfer books are not closed and no record date is fixed for determination of the shareholders of record, then the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed or the date of adoption of a resolution of the Board of Directors declaring a dividend, allotment of rights, change, conversion or exchange of shares, as the case may be, shall be the record date for such determinati on.

 3.12  Meeting by Remote Communications. A regular or special meeting of the shareholders may be held solely by any combination of means of remote communication through which the shareholders may participate in the meeting, if notice of the meeting is given to every holder of shares entitled to vote and if the number of shares held by the shareholders so participating in the meeting would be sufficient to constitute a quorum at the meeting. In addition, a shareholder not physically present in person or by proxy at a regular or special meeting of the shareholders may, by means of remote communication, participate in a meeting of shareholders held at a designated place. Participation by a shareholder through means of remote communication constitutes p resence at the meeting in person or by proxy if all other requirements for such presence are met. 
Whenever one or more shareholders participate in a shareholder meeting by means of remote communication: (a) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and entitled to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a shareholder; (b) the corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide each shareholder participating by means of a remote communication with a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting, including an opportunity to (i) read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with those proceedings, (ii) if allowed by the procedures governing the meeting, have the shareholder's remarks heard or read by other participants in the meeting substantially concurrently with the making of those remarks, and (iii) if otherwise entitled, vote on matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders.

 10 
 
 
Directors or any authorized officer of the Corporation, to demonstrate the accuracy of any information submitted by the shareholder pursuant to this Section 4.3 and (B) a written update of any information previously submitted by the shareholder pursuant to this Section 4.3 as of an earlier date.

 4.4  Term of Office. The Board of Directors shall be elected by the shareholders at their regular meeting and at any special shareholders' meeting called for that purpose. A director shall hold office until the annual meeting for the year in which his or her term expires (or indefinitely if no term is stated upon election or appointment to the Board of Directors) and until the director's successor is elected and qualifies, or until the earlier death, resignation, removal, or disqualification of the director. 
 4.5  Quorum. A majority of the Board of Directors constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business; provided, however, that if any vacancies exist by reason of death, resignation, or otherwise, a majority of the remaining directors constitutes a quorum. If less than a quorum is present at any meeting, a majority of the directors present may adjourn the meeting from  time to time without further notice. 
 4.6  Action of Directors. The acts of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present are the acts of the Board of Directors. 
 4.7  Meetings. Meetings of the Board of Directors may be held from time to time at any place, within or without the State of Minnesota, that the Board of Directors may select. If the Board of Directors fails to select a place for a meeting, the meeting shall be held at the principal executive office of the Corporation.

If the notice is not to be mailed, then the notice must be given at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the meeting.

Notice of the meeting of the 
   
 11 
 
 
Board of Directors need not state the purpose of the meeting. A director may orally or in writing waive notice of the meeting. Attendance by a director at a meeting of the Board of Directors also constitutes a waiver of notice of such meeting, unless the director objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of business because the meeting allegedly is not lawfully called or convened and such director does not participate thereafter in the meeting. 
 4.8  Meeting by Remote Communications.

Participation in a meeting by that means constitutes presence at the meeting. In addition, any meeting among directors may be conducted solely by one or more means of remote communication through which all of the directors may participate with each other during the meeting, if the same notice is given of the meeting required hereunder, and if the number of directors so participating in the meeting is sufficie nt to constitute a quorum at the meeting. 
 4.9  Compensation. Directors may receive such compensation as may be determined from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors. 
 4.10  Committee. By the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors, the Board of Directors may establish a committee or committees having the authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the business of the Corporation to the extent provided in the resolution adopted by the Board of Directors. A committee shall consist of one or more persons, who need not be directors, that have been appointed by affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present. A majority of the members of the committee present at any meeting of the committee is a quorum for the transaction of business, unless a larger or smaller proportion or number is provided in the resolution approved by the Board of Directors. Minutes of any meetings of committees created by the Board of Directors shall be available upon request to members of the committee and to any director. 
 4.11  Action by Absent Director. A director may give advance written consent or opposition to a proposal to be acted upon at a Board of Directors meeting by giving a written statement to the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial officer, or any director which sets forth the proposal to be voted on and contains a statement of the director's voting preference with regard to the proposal. An advance written statement does not constitute presence of the director for purposes of determining a quorum, but the advance written statement shall be counted in the vote on the subject proposal provided that the proposal acted on at the meeting is substantially the same or has substantially the same effect as the proposal set forth in the advance written statement. The advance written statement by a director on a proposal shall be included in the records of the Board of Directors' action on the proposal. 
 4.12  Removal of Directors by Board of Directors. Any director who has been elected by the Board of Directors to fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors, or to fill a directorship created by action of the Board of Directors, and who has not subsequently been reelected by the shareholders, may be removed by a majority vote of all directors constituting the Board, exclusive of the director whose removal is  proposed. 
 4.13  Vacancies. Any vacancy on the Board of Directors may be filled by vote of the remaining directors, even though less than a quorum. 
 4.14  Written Action by Less than All of the Directors. Any action which may be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting and notice thereof if a consent in writing setting forth the action taken is signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by the number of directors required to take the same action at a duly held meeting of the Board of Directors at which all of the directors are present. If a written action is signed (or consented to by authenticated electronic communication) by less than all the directors, any director not signing or consenting to the action shall be notified immediately of the content of the action and the effective date of the action. Failure to provide the notice does not invalidate the written action. A director who does not sign or consent to the written action has no liability for the action or actions so taken. 
 4.15  Dissent from Action. A director of the Corporation who is present at a meeting of the Board of Directors at which any action is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless the director objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and does not participate thereafter, or unless the director votes against the action at the meeting, or is prohibited from voting on the action.
