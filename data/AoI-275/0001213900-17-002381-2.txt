 2.9          Voting; Proxies. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, every Stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of Stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such Stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question. At any meeting of Stockholders, all matters (except as otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, the rules and regulations of any stock exchange or listing service applicable to the Corporation, applicable law or pursuant to any rules or regulations applicable to the Corporation or its securities) shall be decided by the affirmative vote of a majority in voting power of shares of stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon; provided, however, that at all meetings of Stockholders for the election of Directors, a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient to elect each Director; and provided, further, that at all meetings of Stockholders at which a determination of when, or with what frequency, any votes (advisory or otherwise) may be taken on matters relating to executive compensation, such determination shall be made by reference to a plurality of the votes cast. Each Stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of Stockholders or to express consent to or dissent from corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such Stockholder by proxy but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after 180 days from its date, unless the proxy is irrevocable. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it expressly states that it is irrevocable and if, and only so long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. A Stockholder may revoke any proxy that is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to the Secretary a revocation of the proxy or by delivering a new proxy bearing a later date. 
   
 2.10        Voting Procedures and Inspectors of Election at Meetings of Stockholders. The Board, in advance of any meeting of Stockholders, may, and shall if required by applicable law, appoint one or more inspectors, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. The Board may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting, the person presiding at the meeting may, and shall if required by applicable law, appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall (a) ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, (b) determine the shares represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (c) count all votes and ballots, (d) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors, and (e) certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and their count of all votes and ballots. The inspectors may appoint or retain other persons or entities to assist the inspectors in the performance of their duties. Unless otherwise provided by the Board, the date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the Stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be determined by the person presiding at the meeting and shall be announced at the meeting. No ballot, proxies or votes, or any revocation thereof or change thereto, shall be accepted by the inspectors after the closing of the polls unless state court of the State of Delaware, upon application by a Stockholder, shall determine otherwise. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of Stockholders, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law. No person who is a candidate for office at an election may serve as an inspector at such  election.
