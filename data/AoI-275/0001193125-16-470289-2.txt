 Stockholders 
 Section 1.1  Annual Meetings. An annual meeting of stockholders shall be held for the election of directors at such date, time and place either within or without the State of Delaware as may be designated by the Board of Directors from time to time. Any other business properly brought before the meeting may be transacted at the annual meeting. 
 Section 1.2  Special Meetings. (a) Special meetings of stockholders may be called at any time by, and only by, (i) the Board of Directors or (ii) solely to the extent required by Section 1.2(b), the Secretary of the Corporation. Each special meeting shall be held at such date, time and place either within or without the State of Delaware as may be stated in the notice of the meeting. 
(b) A special meeting of the stockholders shall be called by the Secretary upon the written request of the holders of record of not less than twenty-five percent of the voting power of all outstanding shares of common stock of the Corporation (the "Requisite Percent"), subject to the following: 
(1) In order for a special meeting upon stockholder request (a "Stockholder Requested Special Meeting") to be called by the Secretary, one or more written requests for a special meeting (each, a "Special Meeting Request," and collectively, the "Special Meeting Requests") stating the purpose of the special meeting and the matters proposed to be acted upon thereat must be signed and dated by the Requisite Percent of record holders of common stock of the Corporation (or their duly authorized agents), must be delivered to the Secretary at  the principal executive offices of the Corporation and must set forth: 
(i) in the case of any director nominations proposed to be presented at such Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, the information required by the third paragraph of Section 1.11( b); 
(ii) in the case of any matter (other than a director nomination) proposed to be conducted at such Stockholder Requested Special Meeting, the information required by the fourth par agraph of Section 1.11(b); and 
 
 
(iii) an agreement by the requesting stockholder(s) to notify the Corporation immediately in the case of any disposition prior to the record date for the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting of shares of common stock of the Corporation owned of record and an acknowledgement that any such disposition shall be deemed a revocation of such Special Meeting Request to the extent of such disposition, such that the number of shares disposed of shall not be included in determining whether the Requisite Percent has been reached. 
The Corporation will provide the requesting stockholder(s) with notice of the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the Stockholder Requested Special Meeting. Each requesting stockholder is required to update the notice delivered pursuant to this Section not later than ten business days after such record date to provide any ma terial changes in the foregoing information as of such record date. 
In determining whether a special meeting of stockholders has been requested by the record holders of shares representing in the aggregate at least the Requisite Percent, multiple Special Meeting Requests delivered to the Secretary will be considered together only if each such Special Meeting Request (x) identifies substantially the same purpose or purposes of the special meeting and substantially the same matters proposed to be acted on at the special meeting (in each case as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors), and (y) has been dated and delivered to the Secretary within sixty days of the earliest dated of such Special Meeting Requests. If the record holder is not the signatory to the Special Meeting Request, such Special Meeting Request will not be valid unless documentary evidence is supplied to the Secretary at the time of delivery of such Special Meeting Request (or within ten business days thereafter) of such signatory's authority to execute the Special Meeting Request on behalf of the record holder. Any requesting stockholder may revoke his, her or its Special Meeting Request at any time by written revocation delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation; provided, however, that if following such revocation (or any deemed revocation pursuant to clause (iii) above), the unrevoked valid Special Meeting Requests represent in the aggregate less than the Requisite Percent, there shall be no requirement to hold a special meeting. The first date on which unrevoked valid Special Meeting Requests constituting not less than the Requisite Percent  shall have been delivered to the Corporation is referred to herein as the "Request Receipt Date". 
 (2) A Special Meeting Request shall not be valid if: 
(i) the Special Meeting Request relates to an item of business that is not a proper subject for stockholder action under applicable law; 
(ii) the Request Receipt Date is during the period commencing ninety days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding annual meeting and ending on the d ate of the next annual meeting; 
(iii) the purpose specified in the Special Meeting Request is not the election of directors and an identical or substantially similar item (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, a "Similar Item") was presented at any meeting of stockholders held within the twelve months prior to the Request Receipt Date; or 
   
 2 
 
 
(iv) a Similar Item is included in the Corporation's notice as an item of business to be brought before a stockholder meeting that has been called but not yet held or that is calle d for a date within ninety days of the Request Receipt Date. 
(3) A Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall be held at such date and time as may be fixed by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that the Stockholder Requested Special  Meeting shall be called for a date not more than ninety days after the Request Receipt Date. 
(4) Business transacted at any Stockholder Requested Special Meeting shall be limited to (i) the purpose(s) stated in the valid Special Meeting Request(s) received from the Requisite Percent of record holders and (ii) any additional matters that the Board of Directors determines to include in the Corporation's notice of the meeting. If none of the stockholders who submitted the Special Meeting Request appears or sends a qualified representative to present the matters to be presented for consideration that were specified in the Stockholder Meeting Request, the Corporation need not present such matters for a vote at such meeting, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such matter may have been received by the  Corporation. 
 Section 1.3  Notice of Meetings. Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given which shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise required by law, the written notice of any meeting shall be given not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. Such notice shall be deemed to be given (i) if mailed, when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder's address as it appears on the records of the Corporation; (ii) if sent by electronic mail, when delivered to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive such notice; and (iii) if posted on an electronic network together with a separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later to occur of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice of such posting. Notice shall be deemed to have been given to all stockholders of record who share an address if notice is given in accordance with the "householding" rules set forth in Rule 14a-3(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and Section 233 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
 Section 1.4  Adjournments. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may be adjourned from time to time, to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. 
 Section 1.5  Quorum. At each meeting of stockholders, except where otherwise required by law, the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote on a matter at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum. For purposes of 
   
 3 
 
 
the foregoing, where a separate vote by class or classes is required for any matter, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of such class or classes, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. Two or more classes or series of stock shall be considered a single class if the holders thereof are entitled to vote together as a single class at the meeting. In the absence of a quorum of the holders of any class of stock entitled to vote on a matter, the meeting of such class may be adjourned from time to time in the manner provided by Sections 1.4 and 1.6 of these by-laws until a quorum of such class shall be so present or represented. Shares of its own capital stock belonging on the record date for the meeting to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a fiduciary capacity. 
 Section 1.6  Organization. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by a Chairman of the Board, if any, or in the absence of a Chairman of the Board by a Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or in the absence of a Vice Chairman of the Board by a Chief Executive Officer, or in the absence of a Chief Executive Officer by a President, or in the absence of a President by a Chief Operating Officer, or in the absence of a Chief Operating Officer by a Vice President, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by a chairman designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such designation by a chairman chosen at the meeting. A Secretary, or in the absence of a Secretary an Assistant Secretary, shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in the absence of a Secretary and any Assistant Secretary the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting. 
The order of business at each such meeting shall be as determined by the chairman of the meeting. The chairman of the meeting shall have the right and authority to adjourn a meeting of stockholders without a vote of stockholders and to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts and things as are necessary or desirable for the proper conduct of the meeting and are not inconsistent with any rules or regulations adopted by the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of the certificate of incorporation, including the establishment of procedures for the maintenance of order and safety, limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments on the affairs of the Corporation, restrictions on entry to such meeting after the time prescribed for the commencement thereof and the opening and closing of the voting polls for each item upon which a vote is to be t aken. 
 Section 1.7  Inspectors. Prior to any meeting of stockholders, the Board of Directors, a Chairman of the Board, a Vice Chairman of the Board, a Chief Executive Officer, a President, a Chief Operating Officer, a Vice President or any other officer designated by the Board shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at such meeting and make a written report thereof and may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate is able to act at the meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall ascertain the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, determine the shares represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, count all votes and ballots, determine and retain for a r easonable period a record 
   
 4 
 
 
of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors and certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and their count of all votes and ballots. The inspectors may appoint or retain other persons to assist them in the performance of their duties. The date and time of the opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at the meeting. No ballot, proxy or vote, nor any revocation thereof or change thereto, shall be accepted by the inspectors after the closing of the polls. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and ballots, the inspectors shall be limited to an examination of the proxies, any envelopes submitted therewith, any information provided by a stockholder who submits a proxy by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission from which it can be determined that the proxy was authorized by the stockholder, ballots and the regular books and records of the Corporation, and they may also consider other reliable information for the limited purpose of reconciling proxies and ballots submitted by or on behalf of banks, brokers, their nominees or similar persons which represent more votes than the holder of a proxy is authorized by the record owner to cast or more votes than the stockholder holds of record. If the inspectors consider other reliable information for such purpose, they shall, at the time they make their certification, specify the precise information considered by them, including the person or persons from whom they obtained the information, when the information was obtained, the means by which the information was obtained and the basis for the inspectors' belief that such information is accurate and reliable. 
 Section 1.8  Voting; Proxies. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question. If the certificate of incorporation provides for more or less than one vote for any share on any matter, every reference in these by-laws to a majority or other proportion of shares of stock shall refer to such majority or other proportion of the votes of such shares of stock. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power, regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation generally. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date with a Secretary. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be by written ballot unless so directed by the chairman of the meeting or the Board of Directors. In all matters, unless otherwise required by law, the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on such matter, with all shares of common stock of the Corporation and other stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on such matter considered for this purpose as a single class, shall be the act of the stockholders. Where a separate vote by class or classes is required, the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than a majority (or, in the case of an election of directors, a plurality) of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting by stockholders in that class or classes entitled to vote on such matter shall be the act of such class or classes, except as otherwise required by law, the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws. For purposes of this Section 1.8, votes cast "for" or "against" and "abstentions" with respect to such matter shall be counted as shares of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on such matter, while "broker nonvotes" (or other shares of stock of the Corporation similarly not e ntitled to vote) shall not be counted as shares entitled to vote on such matter.

 Section 1.9  Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting. 
In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty days prior to the action for which a record date is being established. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the  day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. 
 Section 1.10  List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote. A Secretary shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the municipality where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. 
 Section 1.11  Advance Notice of Stockholder Nominees for Director and Other Stockholder Proposals. (a) The matters to be considered and brought before any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation (other than a Stockholder Requested Special Meeting) shall be limited to only such matters, including the nomination and election of directors, as shall be brought properly before such meeting in compliance with the procedures set forth in t his Section 1.11 and in Section 1.12, as the case may be. 
(b) For any matter to be properly brought before any annual meeting of stockholders, the matter must be (i) specified in the notice of annual meeting given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (ii) otherwise brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, (iii) brought before the annual 
   
 6 
 
 
meeting in the manner specified in this Section 1.11(b) (x) by a stockholder that holds of record stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at the annual meeting on such matter (including any election of a director) or (y) by a person (a "Nominee Holder") that holds such stock through a nominee or "street name" holder of record of such stock and can demonstrate to the Corporation such indirect ownership of, and such Nominee Holder's entitlement to vote, such stock on such matter or (iv) brought before the annual meeting in accordance  with Section 1.12. 
In addition to any other requirements under applicable law, the certificate of incorporation and these by-laws, and except as provided in Section 1.12, persons nominated by stockholders for election as directors of the Corporation and any other proposals by stockholders shall be properly brought before an annual meeting of stockholders only if notice of any such matter to be presented by a stockholder at such meeting (a "Stockholder Notice") shall be delivered to a Secretary at the principal executive office of the Corporation not less than ninety nor more than one hundred and twenty days prior to the first anniversary date of the annual meeting for the preceding year; provided, however, that if and only if the annual meeting is not scheduled to be held within a period that commences thirty days before and ends thirty days after such anniversary date (an annual meeting date outside such period being referred to herein as an "Other Meeting Date"), such Stockholder Notice shall be given in the manner provided herein by the later of (i) the close of business on the date ninety days prior to such Other Meeting Date or (ii) the close of business on the tenth day following the date on which such Other Meeting Date is first publicly announced or d isclosed. 
Any stockholder desiring to nominate any person or persons (as the case may be) for election as a director or directors of the Corporation at an annual meeting of stockholders pursuant to this Section 1.11 shall deliver, as part of such Stockholder Notice, a statement in writing setting forth the name of the person or persons to be nominated, the number and class of all shares of each class of stock of the Corporation owned of record and beneficially by each such person, as reported to such stockholder by such person, the factual information regarding each such person required by paragraphs (a), (e) and (f) of Item 401 of Regulation S-K adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, each such person's signed consent to serve as a director of the Corporation if elected, such stockholder's name and address, the number and class of all shares of each class of stock of the Corporation owned of record and beneficially by such stockholder and, in the case of a Nominee Holder, evidence establishing such Nominee Holder's indirect ownership of stock and entitlement to vote such stock for the election of directors at the annual meeting. The Corporation may require any proposed director nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the Corporation and to comply with applicable law. If a stockholder is entitled to vote only for a specific class or category of directors at a meeting (annual or special), such stockholder's right to nominate one or more individuals for election as a direc tor at the meeting shall be limited to such class or category of directors. 
Any stockholder who gives a Stockholder Notice of any matter (other than a nomination for director or as provided in Section 1.12) proposed to be brought before an annual meeting of stockholders shall deliver, as part of such Stockholder Notice, the text of the proposal to be presented and a brief written statement of the reasons why such stockholder favors the proposal and setting forth such stockholder's name and address, the number and class of all shares of each class of stock of the Corporation owned of record and beneficially by such stockholder, any material interest of such stockholder in the matter proposed (other than as a stockholder), if applicable, and, in the case of a Nominee Holder, evidence establishing such Nominee Holder's indirect ownership of stock and entitlement to vote such stock on the matter proposed at the annual meeting. 
   
 7 
 
 
As used in these by-laws (other than for purposes of Section 1.12), shares "beneficially owned" shall mean all shares which such person is deemed to beneficially own pursuant to Ru les 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act. 
Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 1.11 to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation at the next annual meeting of stockholders is increased by virtue of an increase in the size of the Board of Directors and either all of the nominees for director at the next annual meeting of stockholders or the size of the increased Board of Directors is not publicly announced or disclosed by the Corporation at least one hundred days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a Stockholder Notice shall also be considered timely under this Section 1.11, but only with respect to nominees to stand for election at the next annual meeting as the result of any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to a Secretary at the principal executive office of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the first day on which all such nominees or the size of the increased Board of Directors shall have been publicly announced  or disclosed. 
(c) For any matter to be properly brought before a special meeting of stockholders, the matter must be set forth in the Corporation's notice of such meeting given by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or by the Secretary of the Company pursuant to Section 1.2(a)(ii). In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any stockholder entitled to vote for the election of such director(s) at such meeting may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as are specified in the Corporation's notice of such meeting, but only if a Stockholder Notice containing the information required by the third paragraph of Section 1.11(b) hereof shall be delivered to a Secretary at the principal executive office of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the first day on which the date of the special meeting and either the names of all nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such me eting or the number of directors to be elected shall have been publicly announced or disclosed. 
(d) For purposes of this Section 1.11, a matter shall be deemed to have been "publicly announced or disclosed" if such matter is disclosed in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, the Associated Press or a comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
(e) In no event shall the postponement or adjournment of an annual meeting already publicly noticed or a special meeting, or any announcement thereof, commence a new period for the giving of notice as provided in this Section 1.11. This Section 1.11 shall not apply to (i) any stockholder proposal made pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, (ii) any nomination of a director in an election in which only the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock of the Corporation issued pursuant to Article FOURTH of the certificate of incorporation are entitled to vote (unless otherwise provided in the terms of such stock), (iii) any director nomination pursuant to Section 1.12 or (iv) any Stockholder Requested  Special Meeting except as specifically provided in Section 1.2(b). 
   
 8 
 
 
(f) The chairman of any meeting of stockholders, in addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall have the power and duty to determine whether notice of nominees and other matters proposed to be brought before a meeting has been duly given in the manner provided in this Section 1.11 or Section 1.2, as applicable and, if not so given, shall direct and declare at the meeting that such nominees and other matters shall not be considered. 
 Section 1.12  Stockholder Nominations Included in the Corporation's Proxy Materials . 
 (a)  Inclusion of Proxy Access Nominee in Proxy Statement. Subject to the provisions of this Section 1.12, if expressly requested in the relevant Nomination Notice (as defined below), the Corporation shall include in its proxy statement  for any annual meeting of stockholders (but not at any special meeting of stockholders): 
(1) the name of any person nominated for election (the "Proxy Access Nominee"), which shall also be included on the Corporation's form of proxy and ballot, by any Nominating Stockh older (as defined below); 
(2) disclosure about the Proxy Access Nominee and the Nominating Stockholder required under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission or other applicable law to be includ ed in the proxy statement; 
(3) any statement included by the Nominating Stockholder in the Nomination Notice for inclusion in the proxy statement in support of the Proxy Access Nominee's election to the Board of Directors (subject, without limitation, to Section 1.12(e)(ii)), if such statement does not exceed 500 words; and 
(4) any other information that the Corporation or the Board of Directors determines, in their discretion, to include in the proxy statement relating to the nomination of the Proxy Access Nominee, including, without limitation, (1) any statement in opposition to the nomination, (2) any of the information provided pursuant to this Section 1.12 and (3) any soli citation materials or related information with respect to the Proxy Access Nominee. 
For purposes of this Section 1.12, any determination to be made by the Board of Directors may be made by the Board of Directors, a committee of the Board or any officer of the Corporation designated by the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board and any such determination shall be final and binding on the Corporation, any Eligible Holder, any Nominating Stockholder, any Proxy Access Nominee and any other person so long as made in good faith (without any further requirements). The chairman of any annual meeting of stockholders, in addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall have the power and duty to determine whether a Proxy Access Nominee has been nominated in accordance with the requirements of this Section 1.12 and, if not so nominated, shall direct and declare at the meeting that such Proxy Access Nominee shall not b e considered. 
 (b)  Maximum Number of Proxy Access Nominees . 
(1) The Corporation shall not be required to include in the proxy statement for an annual meeting of stockholders more Proxy Access Nominees than that number of directors constituting the greater of (1) two or (2) twenty percent of the total number of directors of the Corporation on the last day on 
   
 9 
 
 
which a Nomination Notice may be submitted pursuant to this Section 1.12 (rounded down to the nearest whole number) (the "Maximum Number"). In the event that one or more vacancies for any reason occurs on the Board of Directors after the deadline set forth in Section 1.12(d) below but before the date of the annual meeting, and the Board of Directors resolves to reduce the size of the board in connection therewith, the Maximum Number shall be calculated based on the number of directors in office as so reduced. The Maximum Number for a particular annual meeting shall be reduced by (1) Proxy Access Nominees who are subsequently withdrawn, (2) Proxy Access Nominees that the Board of Directors itself decides to nominate for election at such annual meeting and (3) the number of incumbent directors of the Corporation who had been Proxy Access Nominees with respect to any of the preceding two annual meetings of stockholders and whose reelection at the upcoming annual meeting is being recommended by the Board of Directors. 
(2) If the number of Proxy Access Nominees pursuant to this Section 1.12 for any annual meeting of stockholders exceeds the Maximum Number then, promptly upon notice from the Corporation, each Nominating Stockholder will select one Proxy Access Nominee for inclusion in the proxy statement until the Maximum Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of the ownership position as disclosed in each Nominating Stockholder's Nomination Notice, with the process repeated if the Maximum Number is not reached after each Nominating Stockholder has selected one Proxy Access Nominee. If, after the deadline for submitting a Nomination Notice as set forth in Section 1.12(d), a Nominating Stockholder becomes ineligible or withdraws its nomination or a Proxy Access Nominee becomes unwilling to serve on the Board of Directors, whether before or after the mailing of the definitive proxy statement, then the nomination shall be disregarded, and the Corporation (1) shall not be required to include in its proxy statement or on any ballot or form of proxy the disregarded Proxy Access Nominee or any successor or replacement nominee proposed by the Nominating Stockholder or by any other Nominating Stockholder and (2) may otherwise communicate to its stockholders, including without limitation by amending or supplementing its proxy statement or ballot or form of proxy, that the Proxy Access Nominee will not be included as a Proxy Access Nominee in the proxy statement or on any ballot or form of proxy and will not be voted on at the annual meeting. 
 (c)  Eligibility of Nominating Stockholder . 
(1) An "Eligible Holder" is a person who has either (1) been a record holder of the shares of common stock used to satisfy the eligibility requirements in this Section 1.12(c) continuously for the three-year period specified in Subsection (ii) below or (2) provides to a Secretary of the Corporation, within the time period referred to in Section 1.12(d), evidence of continuous ownership of such shares for such three-year period from one or more securities intermediaries in a form that the Board of Directors determines would be deemed a cceptable for purposes of a shareholder proposal under Rule  14a-8(b)(2)  under the Exchange Act (or any successor rule). 
(2) An Eligible Holder or group of up to fifteen Eligible Holders may submit a nomination in accordance with this Section 1.12 only if the person or group (in the aggregate) has continuously owned at least the Minimum Number (as defined below) of shares of the Corporation's common stock throughout the 
   
 10 
 
 
three-year period preceding and including the date of submission of the Nomination Notice, and continues to own at least the Minimum Number through the date of the annual meeting. Each Eligible Holder or group of up to fifteen Eligible Holders that submits a nomination in accordance with this Section 1.12 and has satisfied, as determined by the Board of Directors, all applicable conditions and complied with all applicable procedures set forth in this Section 1.12 is a "Nominating Stockholder". A group of funds that are (i) under common management and investment control, (ii) under common management and funded primarily by a single employer or (iii) a "group of investment companies," as such term is defined in Section 12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, shall be treated as one Eligible Holder if such Eligible Holder shall provide together with the Nomination Notice documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation that demonstrates that the funds meet the criteria set forth in (i), (ii) or (iii) hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a nomination by a Nominating Stockholder that includes more than one Eligible Holder, any and all requirements and obligations for an individual Eligible Holder that are set forth in this Section 1.12, including the minimum holding period, shall apply to each individual Eligible Holder comprising the Nominating Stockholder; provided, however, that the Minimum Number shall apply to the ownership of the Nominating Stockholder in the aggregate. Should any Eligible Holder withdraw from a group of Eligible Holders constituting a Nominating Stockholder at any time prior to the annual meeting of stockholders, the Nominating Stockholder shall only be deemed to own the shares held by the remaining Eligible Holders. As used in this Section 1.12, any reference to a "group" or "group of Eligible Holders" refers to any Nominating Stockholder that consists of more than one Eligible  Holder and to all the Eligible Holders that make up such Nominating Stockholder. 
(3) The "Minimum Number" of shares of the Corporation's common stock means three percent of the number of outstanding shares of common stock as of the most recent date for which such amount is given in any filing by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the submission of the Nomination Notice. 
(4) For purposes of this Section 1.12, an Eligible Holder "owns" only those outstanding shares of the Corporation as to which the Eligible Holder possesses both (1) the full voting and investment rights pertaining to the shares and (2) the full economic interest in (including the opportunity for profit and risk of loss on) such shares; provided that the number of shares calculated in accordance with clauses (1) and (2) shall not include any shares (A) sold by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates in any transaction that has not been settled or closed, (B) purchased by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates but the purchase has not yet been settled or closed, (C) borrowed by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates for any purpose or purchased by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates pursuant to an agreement to resell or subject to any other obligation to resell to another person, or (D) subject to any option, warrant, forward contract, swap, contract of sale, other derivative or similar agreement entered into by such Eligible Holder or any of its affiliates, whether any such instrument or agreement is to be settled with shares or with cash based on the notional amount or value of outstanding shares of the Corporation, in any such case which instrument or agreement has, or is intended to have, the purpose or effect of (x) reducing in any manner, to any extent or at any time in the future, s uch Eligible Holder's or any of its affiliates' full right to vote or direct the voting of 
   
 11 
 
 
any such shares, and/or (y) hedging, offsetting, or altering to any degree, gain or loss arising from the full economic ownership of such shares by such Eligible Holder or any of i ts affiliates. 
An Eligible Holder "owns" shares held in the name of a nominee or other intermediary so long as the Eligible Holder retains the right to instruct how the shares are voted with respect to the election of directors and possesses the full economic interest in the shares. An Eligible Holder's ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the Eligible Holder has delegated any voting power by means of a proxy, power of attorney, or other similar instrument or arrangement that is revocable at any time by the Eligible Holder. An Eligible Holder's ownership of shares shall be deemed to continue during any period in which the Eligible Holder has loaned such shares provided that the Eligible Holder has the power to recall such loaned shares within a reasonable period of time and will recall such loaned shares as of the date of the annual meeting. The terms "owned," "owning" and other variations of the word "own" shall have correlative meanings. Whether outstanding shares of the Corporation are "owned" for these purposes shall be determined by the  Board of Directors. 
(5) No Eligible Holder shall be permitted to be a part of more than one group of Eligible Holders constituting a Nominating Stockholder, and if any Eligible Holder appears as a member of more than one group, such Eligible Holder shall be deemed to be a member of the group of Eligible Holders that has the largest ownership position as reflected in the Nominat ion Notice. 
(6) Any Eligible Holder (including each Eligible Holder whose stock ownership is counted as part of a group for the purposes of qualifying as a Nominating Stockholder) whose Proxy Access Nominee is elected as a director at the annual meeting of stockholders will not be eligible to nominate or participate in the nomination of a Proxy Access Nominee for the following two annual meetings of stockholders pursuant to this Section 1.12 other than nominating (either individually or as a part of a group constituting a Nominating Stockholder) a Proxy Access Nominee previously nominated and elected pursuant to this Section 1.12 by such Eligible Holder or a group of Eligible Holders of which such Eligible Holder was a mem ber. 
 (d)  Nomination Notice.

If the Corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate which the Corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock, provided that, except as otherwise required by law, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate which the Corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the Corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of such class or series of stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights. Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated shares of any class or series of stock, the Corporation shall send to the registered owner thereof a written notice containing the information required by law to be set forth or stated on certificates representing shares of such class or series or a statement that the Corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of such class or series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictio ns of such preferences and/or rights.

The Corporation may issue a new certificate of stock in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such owner's legal representative, to give the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate.
