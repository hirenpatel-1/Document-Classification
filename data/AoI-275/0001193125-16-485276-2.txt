The purposes for which the board shall be entitled not to redeem the Rights, and accordingly to exercise any power of the Company to allot shares of the Company or effect an Exchange, shall include (without limitation) the following where, the board may decide to do so, would improve the likelihood that:

 4 
 
 
   5.4.4any potential acquisition or change of Control of the Company which would not be likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole, having had  regard to the matters in section 172 of the Companies Act 2006, would be prevented; 
   
   5.4.5the long term interests of the Company or its members, employees and its business would be safeguarded or both; or 
   
   5.4.6 the Company would not suffer serious economic harm, 
 or all or any of the above.

   5.5.1interests in shares carrying 20 per cent. or more of the voting rights attributable to the capital of the Company which are exercisable at a general meeting; 
   
   5.5.2such percentage of the issued share capital of the Company as would, if the whole of the income or assets of the Company were in fact distributed among the members (without regard to any rights which he or any other person has as a loan creditor) entitle him to receive 20 per cent. or more of the income or assets so distributed; or 
   
   5.5.3such rights as would, in the event of the winding-up of the Company or in any other circumstances, entitle him to receive 20 per cent. or more of the assets of the Company which wo uld then be available for distribution among the members. 
   
 5.6 For the purposes of this article 5: 
   
   5.6.1 "person" shall include any individual, firm, body corporate, unincorporated association, government, state or agency of state, association, joint venture or partnership, in each case whether or not having a separate legal personality and "group of affiliated or associated persons" shall have the meaning given to such terms under the United States federal securities  laws, including the Exchange Act;

 10. SEPARATE HOLDINGS OF SHARES IN CERTIFICATED AND UNCERTIFICATED FORM 
Notwithstanding anything else contained in these articles, where any class of shares is, for the time being, a participating security, unless the directors otherwise determine, shares of any such class held by the same holder or joint holder in certificated form and uncertificated form shall be treated as separate holdings. 
 VARIATION OF RIGHTS 
   
 11. VARIATION OF RIGHTS 
   
 11.1If at any time the capital of the Company is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class may be varied, either while the Company is a going concern o r during or in contemplation of a winding up: 
   
   11.1.1 in such manner (if any) as may be provided by those rights; or 
   
   11.1.2in the absence of any such provision, with the consent in writing of the holders of three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class (excluding any shares of that class held as treasury shares), or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class, 
but not otherwise. To every such separate meeting the provisions of these articles relating to general meetings shall apply, except that the necessary quorum shall be (i) at any such meeting other than an adjourned meeting, two persons entitled to vote upon the business to be transacted in respect of a majority in nominal value of the issued shares of the class in question (excluding any shares of that class held as treasury shares), each being a member or a proxy for a member or a duly authorised representative of a corporation which is a member (including for this purpose two persons who are proxies or corporate representatives of the same member); or (ii) at an adjourned meeting, one person holding shares of  the class in question (other than treasury shares) or their proxy. 
   
 6 
 
 
 12. RIGHTS DEEMED NOT VARIED 
Unless otherwise expressly provided by the rights attached to any class of shares, those rights shall be deemed not to be varied by the purchase by the Company of any of its own sh ares or the holding of such shares as treasury shares. 
 SHARE CERTIFICATES 
   
 13. RIGHTS TO SHARE CERTIFICATES 
   
 13.1On becoming the holder of any share other than a share in uncertificated form, every person (other than a financial institution in respect of whom the Company is not required by law to complete and have ready a certificate) shall be entitled, without payment, to have issued to him within two months after allotment or lodgement of a transfer (unless the terms of issue of the shares provide otherwise) one certificate for all the shares of each class registered in his name or, upon payment for every certificate after the first of such reasonable sum as the directors may determine, several certificates each for one or more of his shares. 
   
 13.2Every certificate shall be issued under the seal or under such other form of authentication as the directors may determine (which may include manual or facsimile signatures by one or more directors), and shall specify the number, class and distinguishing numbers (if any) of the shares to which it relates and the amount or respective amounts paid up on them. 
   
 13.3Where a member (other than a financial institution) has transferred part only of the shares comprised in a certificate, the member is entitled, without payment, to have issued to him a certificate in respect of the balance of shares held by him or, upon payment for every certificate after the first of such reasonable sum as the directors may determine, sever al certificates each for one or more of his shares. 
   
 13.4When a member's (other than a financial institution's) holding of shares of a particular class increases, the Company may issue that member with a single, consolidated certificate in respect of all the shares of a particular class which that member holds or a separate certificate in respect of only those shares by which that member's holding has increased. 
   
 13.5A member (other than a financial institution) may request the Company, in writing, to replace the member's separate certificates with a consolidated certificate or the member's consolidated certificate with two or more separate certificates representing such proportion of the shares as the member may specify, provided that any certificate(s) which it is (or they are) to replace has first been returned to the Company for cancellation. When the Company complies with such a request it may charge such reasonable sum as the directors may d etermine for doing so. 
   
 13.6The Company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate for shares held jointly by several persons and delivery of a certificate to whichever of the joint holders' names appears first on the register of members in respect of the joint holding shall be a sufficient delivery to all of them. 
   
 13.7If a certificate issued in respect of a member's shares is damaged or defaced or said to be lost, stolen or destroyed, then that member is entitled to be issued with a replacement certificate in respect of the same shares. A member exercising the right to be issued with such a replacement certificate: 
   
   13.7.1 must return the certificate which is to be replaced to the Company if it is damaged or defaced; and 
   
   13.7.2must comply with such conditions as to evidence, indemnity and the payment of a reasonable fee as the directors may determine. 
   
 7 
 
 
 LIEN 
   
 14. COMPANY'S LIEN ON SHARES NOT FULLY PAID 
The Company has a lien over every share which is partly paid for all amounts (whether presently payable or not) payable at a fixed time or called in respect of that share. The directors may declare any share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this article 14. The Company's lien over a share takes priority over any third party's interest in that share, and extends to any dividend or other money payable by the Company in respect of that share (and, if the lien is enforced and the share is sold by the Company, the proc eeds of sale of that share). 
   
 15. ENFORCING LIEN BY SALE 
The Company may sell, in such manner as the directors determine, any share on which the Company has a lien if an amount in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable and is not paid within 14 clear days after notice has been given to the holder of the share, or the person entitled to it in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the holder or otherwise by operation of law, demanding payment and stating that if the notice is not complied with the shares may be sold. 
   
 16. GIVING EFFECT TO A SALE 
   
 16.1 To give effect to the sale described in article 15: 
   
   16.1.1in the case of a share in certificated form, the directors may authorise any person to execute an instrument of transfer of the share to the purchaser or a person nominated by the  purchaser; 
   
   16.1.2 in the case of a share in uncertificated form, the directors may: 
   
   (A)to enable the Company to deal with the share in accordance with the provisions of this article 16, require the Operator of a relevant system to convert the share into certificated  form; and 
   
   (B)after such conversion, authorise any person to execute an instrument of transfer and take such other steps (including the giving of directions to or on behalf of the holder, who sh all be bound by them) as they think fit to effect the transfer. 
   
 16.2The title of the transferee to the share shall not be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings in reference to the sale. 
   
 17. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS OF SALE 
The net proceeds of the sale, after payment of the costs, shall be applied in payment of so much of the amount for which the lien exists as is presently payable. Any residue shall (upon surrender to the Company for cancellation of the certificate for the share sold, in the case of a share in certificated form, and subject to a like lien for any amount not presently payable as existed upon the share before the sale) be paid to the person entitled to the share at the date of the sale. 
 CALLS ON SHARES AND FORFEITURE 
   
 18. CALLS 
   
 18.1Subject to the terms of allotment, the directors may make calls upon the members in respect of any amounts unpaid on their shares (whether in respect of nominal value or premium) and each member shall (subject to receiving at least 14 clear days' notice specifying when and where payment is to be made) pay to the Company as required by the notice the amount called on his shares. A call may be required to be paid by instalments. A call may, before receipt by the Company of an amount due under it, be revoked in whole or in part and payment of a call may be postponed in whole or part. A person upon whom a call is made shall remain liable for calls made upon him notwithstanding the subsequent transfer of the shares  in respect of which the call was made. 
   
 18.2A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the directors authorising the call was passed. 
   
 8 
 
 
 19. JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY IN RESPECT OF CALLS 
The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay all calls in respect of it. 
   
 20. INTEREST 
If a call or an instalment of a call remains unpaid after it has become due and payable the person from whom it is due shall pay interest on the amount unpaid, from the day it became due and payable until it is paid at the rate fixed by the terms of allotment of the shares in question or fixed in the notice of the call or, if no rate is fixed, at the appropriate rate (as defined in the Acts). The directors may, however, waive payment of the interest wholly or in part. 
   
 21. SUMS TREATED AS CALLS 
An amount payable in respect of a share on allotment or at any fixed date, whether in respect of nominal value or premium or as an instalment of a call, shall be deemed to be a call and if it is not paid these articles shall apply as if that sum had become due and payable by virtue of a call. 
   
 22. POWER TO DIFFERENTIATE 
Subject to the terms of allotment, the directors may differentiate between the holders in the amounts and times of payment of calls on their shares. 
   
 23. PAYMENT OF CALLS IN ADVANCE 
The directors may receive from any member willing to advance it all or any part of the amount unpaid on the shares held by him (beyond the sums actually called up) as a payment in advance of calls, and such payment shall, to the extent of it, extinguish the liability on the shares in respect of which it is advanced. The Company may pay interest on the amount so received, or so much of it as exceeds the sums called up on the shares in respect of which it has been received, at such rate (if any) as the member and the directors agree. 
   
 24. NOTICE IF CALL NOT PAID AND FORFEITURE 
If a call or an instalment of a call remains unpaid after it has become due and payable the directors may give to the person from whom it is due not less than 14 clear days' notice requiring payment of the amount unpaid together with any interest which may have accrued. The notice shall name the place where payment is to be made and shall state that if the notice is not complied with the shares in respect of which the call was made will be liable to be forfeited. If the notice is not complied with, any shares in respect of which it was given may, before the payment required by the notice has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the directors and the forfeiture shall include all dividends and other amounts  payable in respect of the forfeited shares and not paid before the forfeiture. 
   
 25. SALE OF FORFEITED SHARES 
   
 25.1A forfeited share may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise disposed of on such terms and in such manner as the directors determine either to the person who was before the forfeiture the holder (including a person who was entitled to the share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the holder or otherwise by operation of law) or to any other person and, at any time before the disposition, the forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the directors determine. Where for the purposes of its disposal a forfeited share is to be transf erred to any person: 
   
   25.1.1in the case of a share in certificated form, the directors may authorise any person to execute an instrument of transfer and take such other steps (including the giving of directions to or on behalf of the holder, who shall be bound by them) as they think fit to effect the transfer; and 
   
 9 
 
 
   25.1.2 in the case of a share in uncertificated form, the directors may: 
   
   (A)to enable the Company to deal with the share in accordance with the provisions of this article 25, require the Operator of a relevant system to convert the share into certificated  form; and 
   
   (B)after such conversion, authorise any person to execute an instrument of transfer and take such other steps (including the giving of directions to or on behalf of the holder, who sh all be bound by them) as they think fit to effect the transfer. 
   
 26. CESSATION OF MEMBERSHIP AND CONTINUING LIABILITY 
A person whose shares have been forfeited shall cease to be a member in respect of the shares forfeited and shall surrender to the Company for cancellation any certificate for the shares forfeited. However, such person shall remain liable to the Company for all amounts which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him to the Company in respect of those shares with interest at the rate at which interest was payable on those amounts before the forfeiture or, if no interest was so payable, at the appropriate rate (as defined in the Acts) from the date of forfeiture until payment. The directors may waive payment wholly or in part or enforce payment without any allowance for the value of the shares at th e time of forfeiture or for any consideration received on their disposal. 
   
 27. STATUTORY DECLARATION AS TO FORFEITURE 
A statutory declaration by a director or the secretary that a share has been forfeited on a specified date shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share and the declaration shall (subject to the execution of an instrument of transfer if necessary, in the case of a share in certificated form) constitute good title to the share and the person to whom the share is disposed of shall not be bound to see to the application of the consideration, if any, nor shall his title to the share be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings relating to the forfeiture or disposal of the share. 
 TRANSFER OF SHARES 
   
 28. TRANSFER OF SHARES IN CERTIFICATED FORM 
The instrument of transfer of a share in certificated form may be in any usual form or in any other form which the directors approve and shall be executed by or on behalf of the tr ansferor and, where the share is not fully paid, by or on behalf of the transferee. 
   
 29. TRANSFER OF SHARES IN UNCERTIFICATED FORM 
Where any class of shares is, for the time being, a participating security, title to shares of that class which are recorded on an Operator register of members as being held in uncertificated form may be transferred by means of the relevant system concerned. The transfer may not be in favour of more than four transferees. 
   
 30. REFUSAL TO REGISTER TRANSFERS 
   
 30.1The directors may, in their absolute discretion, refuse to register the transfer of a share in certificated form which is not fully paid. They may also refuse to register a transfe r of a share in certificated form (whether fully paid or not) unless the instrument of transfer: 
   
   30.1.1 
is lodged, duly stamped, at the Office or at such other place as the directors may appoint and (except in the case of a transfer by a financial institution where a certificate has  not been issued in respect of the share) is accompanied by the 
 
   
 10 
 
 
  certificate for the share to which it relates and such other evidence as the directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer; 
   
   30.1.2 is in respect of only one class of share; and 
   
   30.1.3 is in favour of not more than four transferees. 
   
 30.2The directors may refuse to register a transfer of a share in uncertificated form to a person who is to hold it thereafter in certificated form in any case where the Company is entitled to refuse (or is excepted from the requirement) under the Uncertificated Securities Regulations to register the transfer. 
   
 31. NOTICE OF AND REASONS FOR REFUSAL 
If the directors refuse to register a transfer of a share, they shall as soon as practicable and in any event within two months after the date on which the transfer was lodged with the Company (in the case of a transfer of a share in certificated form) or the date on which the Operator-instruction was received by the Company (in the case of a transfer of a share in uncertificated form to a person who is to hold it thereafter in certificated form) send to the transferee notice of the refusal together with reasons for the refusal. The directors shall send such further information about the reasons for the refusal to the transferee as the transferee may reasonably request. 
   
 32. NO FEE FOR REGISTRATION 
No fee shall be charged for the registration of any instrument of transfer or other document or instruction relating to or affecting the title to any share. 
   
 33. RETENTION OR RETURN OF INSTRUMENT OF TRANSFER 
The Company shall be entitled to retain any instrument of transfer which is registered, but any instrument of transfer which the directors refuse to register shall (except in the c ase of fraud) be returned to the person lodging it when notice of the refusal is given. 
   
 34. RECOGNITION OF RENUNCIATION 
Nothing in these articles shall preclude the directors from recognising a renunciation of the allotment of any share by the allottee in favour of some other person. 
 TRANSMISSION OF SHARES 
   
 35. TRANSMISSION ON DEATH 
If a member dies the survivor or survivors where he was a joint holder, or his personal representatives where he was a sole holder or the only survivor of joint holders, shall be the only persons recognised by the Company as having any title to his interest. However, nothing in this article 35 shall release the estate of a deceased member from any liability  in respect of any share which had been solely or jointly held by him. 
   
 36. ELECTION OF PERSON ENTITLED BY TRANSMISSION 
A person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a member or otherwise by operation of law may, upon such evidence being produced as the directors may properly require to show his title to the share, elect either to become the holder of the share or to have some person nominated by him registered as the transferee. If he elects to become the holder he shall give notice to the Company to that effect. If he elects to have another person registered he shall transfer title to the share to that person. All the provisions of these articles relating to the transfer of shares shall apply to the notice or instrument of transfer (if any) as if it were an instrument of transfer signed by the member and the death or bankruptcy of the member or other event giving rise to the entitlement to the share by operation of law had not occurred. 
   
 11 
 
 
 37. RIGHTS OF PERSON ENTITLED BY TRANSMISSION 
A person becoming entitled to a share by reason of the death or bankruptcy of a member or otherwise by operation of law shall, after giving notice to the Company of his entitlement to the share and upon such evidence being produced as the directors may properly require to show his title to the share, have the rights to which he would be entitled if he were the holder of the share, except that he shall not, before being registered as the holder of the share, be entitled in respect of it to attend or vote at any general meeting or at any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares. A person entitled to a share who has elected for that share to be transferred to some other person pursuant to article 36 shall cease to be entitled to any rights in relation to such share upon that other person being registered as the holder of that share. 
 DISCLOSURE OF INTERESTS 
   
 38. DISCLOSURE OF INTERESTS 
   
 38.1If a member, or any other person appearing to be interested in shares held by that member, has been given a notice under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 and has failed in rel ation to any shares (the  "default shares") to give the Company the information thereby required within 14 days from the date of giving the notice, the following sanctions shall apply, unless the directors otherwise determine in their absolute discretion, in relation to the default shares, including following any transfer of the default shares unless the transfer is an excepted transfer under this a rticle 38: 
   
   38.1.1the member shall not be entitled in respect of the default shares to be present or to vote (either in person or by representative or proxy) at any general meeting or at any separat e meeting of the holders of any class of shares or on any poll; and 
   
   38.1.2where the default shares represent at least 0.25 per cent of their class (calculated exclusive of treasury shares): 
   
   (A)any dividend payable in respect of the shares shall be withheld by the Company, which shall not have any obligation to pay interest on it, and the member shall not be entitled to e lect, pursuant to these articles, to receive shares instead of that dividend; and 
   
   (B)no transfer, other than an excepted transfer, of any shares held by the member in certificated form shall be registered unless: 
   
   (1) the member is not himself in default as regards supplying the information required; and 
   
   (2)the member proves to the satisfaction of the directors that no person in default as regards supplying such information is interested in any of the shares the subject of the transfe r; 
   
 38.2Where the sanctions under article 38.1 apply in relation to any shares, they shall cease to have effect at the end of the period of seven days (or such shorter period as the direct ors may determine) following the earlier of: 
   
   38.2.1 receipt by the Company of the information required by the notice mentioned in that article; and 
   
   38.2.2receipt by the Company of notice that the shares have been transferred by means of an excepted transfer. 
 The directors may suspend or cancel any of the sanctions at any time in relation to any shares. 
   
   
 12 
 
 
 38.3Any new shares in the Company issued in right of default shares shall be subject to the same sanctions as apply to the default shares, and the directors may make any right to an allotment of the new shares subject to sanctions corresponding to those which will apply to those shares on issue, provided that: 
   
   38.3.1any sanctions applying to, or to a right to, new shares by virtue of this article 38.3 shall cease to have effect when the sanctions applying to the related default shares cease to have effect (and shall be suspended or cancelled if and to the extent that the sanctions applying to the related default shares are suspended or cancelled); and 
   
   38.3.2article 38.1 shall apply to the exclusion of this article 38.3 if the Company gives a separate notice under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 in relation to the new shares. 
   
 38.4Where, on the basis of information obtained from a member in respect of any share held by him, the Company gives a notice under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 (a  "Section 793 Notice") to any other person, it shall at the same time send a copy of the notice to the member. The accidental omission to do so, or the non-receipt by the member of the copy, shall, how ever, not invalidate or otherwise affect the application of this article 38. 
   
 38.5Where the member on whom a Section 793 Notice has been served is a Depositary, the obligations of the Depositary acting in its capacity as such shall be limited to disclosing to the Company such information relating to any person appearing to be interested in the shares held by it as has been recorded by the Depositary in accordance with the arrangements entered into by the Company or approved by the board pursuant to which it was appointed as a Depositary. 
   
 38.6 For the purposes of this article 38: 
   
   38.6.1a person, other than the member holding a share, shall be treated as appearing to be interested in that share if the member has informed the Company that the person is, or may be, so interested, or if the Company (after taking account of any information obtained from the member or, pursuant to a notice under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006, from anyone  else) knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the person is, or may be, so interested; 
   
   38.6.2 "interested" shall be construed in the same way as it is for the purpose of section 793 of the Companies Act 2006; 
   
   38.6.3reference to a person having failed to give the Company the information required by a notice, includes (i) reference to his having failed or refused to give all or any part of it; (ii) reference to his having given any information which he knows to be false in a material particular or having recklessly given information which is false in a material particular; and (iii) reference to the Company knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that any of the information provided is false or materially incorrect or incomplete; and 
   
   38.6.4 an  "excepted transfer"  means, in relation to any shares held by a member: 
   
   (A)a transfer pursuant to acceptance of a takeover offer (within the meaning of section 974 of the Companies Act 2006) in respect of shares in the Company; 
   
   (B)a transfer in consequence of a sale made through a recognised investment exchange (as defined in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) or any other stock exchange outside th e United Kingdom on which the Company's shares are normally traded; or 
   
   (C)a transfer which is shown to the satisfaction of the directors to be made in consequence of a sale of the whole of the beneficial interest in the shares to a person who is unconnec ted with the member and with any other person appearing to be interested in the shares. 
   
 38.7Nothing in this article 38 shall limit the powers of the Company under section 794 of the Companies Act 2006 or any other powers of the Company whatsoever. 
   
 13 
 
 
 UNTRACED MEMBERS 
   
 39. UNTRACED MEMBERS 
   
 39.1The Company shall be entitled to sell at the best price reasonably obtainable any share held by a member, or any share to which a person is entitled by transmission (including in c onsequence of the death or bankruptcy of the member or otherwise by operation of law), if: 
   
   39.1.1for a period of 12 years no cheque or warrant or other method of payment for amounts payable in respect of the share sent and payable in a manner authorised by these articles has been cashed or effected and no communication has been received by the Company from the member or person concerned; 
   
   39.1.2during that period the Company has paid at least three dividends (whether interim or final) and no such dividend has been claimed by the member or person concerned; 
   
   39.1.3the Company has, after the expiration of that period, sent a notice to the registered address or last known address of the member or person concerned of its intention to sell such share and before sending such a notice to the member or other person concerned, the Company must have used reasonable efforts to trace the member or other person entitled, engaging , if considered appropriate, a professional asset reunification company or other tracing agent; and 
   
   39.1.4the Company has not during the further period of three months following the sending of the notice referred to in article 39.1.3 above and prior to the sale of the share received an y communication from the member or person concerned. 
   
 39.2The Company shall also be entitled to sell at the best price reasonably obtainable any additional share issued during the said period of 12 years in right of any share to which article 39.1 applies (or in right of any share so issued), if the criteria in articles 39.1.1, 39.1.3 and 39.1.4 are satisfied in relation to the additional share (but as if the words "for a period of 12 years" were omitted from article 39.1.1 and the words ", after the expiration of that period," were omitted from article 39.1.3). 
   
 39.3 To give effect to the sale of any share pursuant to this article 39: 
   
   39.3.1in the case of a share in certificated form, the directors may authorise any person to execute an instrument of transfer of the share to the purchaser or a person nominated by the purchaser and take such other steps (including the giving of directions to or on behalf of the holder, who shall be bound by them) as it thinks fit to effect the transfer; and 
   
   39.3.2 in the case of a share in uncertificated form, the directors may: 
   
   (A)to enable the Company to deal with the share in accordance with the provisions of this article 39, require the Operator of a relevant system to convert the share into certificated  form; and 
   
   (B)after such conversion, authorise any person to execute an instrument of transfer of the shares to the purchaser or person nominated by the purchaser and take such other steps (including the giving of directions to or on behalf of the holder, who shall be bound by them) as it thinks fit to effect the transfer. 
   
 39.4 
The purchaser shall not be bound to see to the application of the proceeds of sale, nor shall his title to the share be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the sale. The Company shall, subject to the provisions of this article 39.4, be indebted to the former member or other person previously entitled to the share for an amount equal to the net proceeds of the sale, but no trust or duty to account shall arise and no interest shall be payable in respect of the proceeds of sale and any money earned on the proceeds of sale may be kept by the Company and used in the business of the Company or invested in any way that the directors may from time to time decide. If no valid claim  for the proceeds of sale has been received by the Company during a period of six 
 
   
 14 
 
 
  years from the date on which the relevant shares were sold by the Company under this article 39, the net proceeds of sale shall be forfeited and such former member or other person previously entitled to the share shall no longer be a creditor for the proceeds of sale and the Company will not be obliged to account to such persons for, or be liable to such per sons in relation to, the proceeds of sale. 
 ALTERATION OF CAPITAL 
   
 40. CONSOLIDATION AND SUB-DIVISION 
   
 40.1 The Company may by ordinary resolution: 
   
   40.1.1consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of larger amount than its existing shares; and 
   
   40.1.2sub-divide its shares, or any of them, into shares of a smaller amount than its existing shares; and determine that, as between the shares resulting from the sub-division, any of t hem may have any preference or advantage as compared with the others. 
   
 40.2Where any difficulty arises in regard to any consolidation or division, the directors may settle such difficulty as they see fit. In particular, without limitation, the directors may sell to any person (including the Company) the shares representing the fractions for the best price reasonably obtainable and distribute the net proceeds of sale in due proporti on among those members or retain such net proceeds for the benefit of the Company and: 
   
   40.2.1in the case of shares in certificated form, the directors may authorise any person to execute an instrument of transfer of the shares to the purchaser or a person nominated by the purchaser and take such other steps (including the giving of directions to or on behalf of the holder, who shall be bound by them) as they think fit to effect such transfer; and 
   
   40.2.2 in the case of shares in uncertificated form, the directors may:

 65.2The directors may specify in the notice convening the meeting that in determining the time for delivery of proxies pursuant to this article 65, no account shall be taken of any part of any day that is not a working day. An appointment of proxy which is not received or delivered in a manner so permitted shall be invalid. 
   
 66. TERMINATION OF APPOINTMENTS OF PROXY 
A vote given by proxy shall be valid notwithstanding the previous termination of the authority of the person voting, unless notice of the termination was delivered in writing to the Company at such place or address at which an appointment of proxy may be duly received under article 65 not later than the last time at which an appointment of proxy should have  been received under article 65 in order for it to be valid.

   85.2.1shall not infringe his duty to avoid a situation in which he has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company as a result of any such office, employment or position, or any such transaction or arrangement, or any interest in any such body corporate; 
   
   85.2.2shall not, by reason of his office as a director of the Company be accountable to the Company for any benefit which he derives from any such office, employment or position, or any  such transaction or arrangement, or from any interest in any such body corporate; 
   
   85.2.3shall not be required to disclose to the Company, or use in performing his duties as a director of the Company, any confidential information relating to any such office, employment, or position if to make such a disclosure or use would result in a breach of a duty or obligation of confidence owed by him in relation to or in connection with such office, emplo yment or position; and 
   
   85.2.4may absent himself from discussions, whether in meetings of the directors or otherwise, and exclude himself from information, which will or may relate to such office, employment, p osition, transaction, arrangement or interest. 
   
 85.3 For the purposes of articles 85.1, 85.2 and 85.3: 
   
   85.3.1a general notice given to the directors that a director is to be regarded as having an interest of the nature and extent specified in the notice in any transaction or arrangement in which a specified person or class of persons is interested shall be deemed to be a disclosure that the director has an interest in any such transaction of the nature and extent s o specified; 
   
   85.3.2an interest of which a director has no knowledge and of which it is unreasonable to expect him to have knowledge shall not be treated as an interest of his; 
   
   85.3.3a director shall be deemed to have disclosed the nature and extent of an interest which consists of him being a director, officer or employee of any subsidiary undertaking of the C ompany; 
   
   85.3.4a director need not disclose an interest if it cannot be reasonably regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest; and 
   
   85.3.5a director need not disclose an interest if, or to the extent that, the other directors are already aware of it (and for this purpose the other directors are treated as aware of an ything of which they ought reasonably to be aware). 
   
 85.4The directors may (subject to such terms and conditions, if any, as they may think fit to impose from time to time, and subject always to their right to vary or terminate such auth orisation) authorise, to the fullest extent permitted by law: 
   
   85.4.1any matter which would otherwise result in a director infringing his duty to avoid a situation in which he has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company and which may reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest (including a conflict of interest and duty  or conflict of duties); and 
   
   85.4.2a director to accept or continue in any office, employment or position in addition to his office as a director of the Company and, without prejudice to the generality of article 85.4.1, may authorise the manner in which a conflict of interest arising out of such office, employment or position may be dealt with, either before or at the time that such a confli ct of interest arises, 
   
 25 
 
 
provided that the authorisation is effective only if (i) any requirement as to the quorum at the meeting at which the matter is considered is met without counting the director in question or any other interested director, and (ii) the matter was agreed to without their voting or would have been agreed to if their votes had not been counted. 
   
 85.5If a matter, or office, employment or position, has been authorised by the directors in accordance with article 85.4 and this article 85.5 then (subject to such terms and conditions, if any, as the directors may think fit to impose from time to time, and subject always to their right to vary or terminate such authorisation or the permissions set out below) no transaction or arrangement relating to any such matter shall be liable to be avoided on the ground of any such matter, or office, employment or position and the relevant director : 
   
   85.5.1shall not infringe his duty to avoid a situation in which he has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Com pany as a result of any such matter, or office, employment or position; 
   
   85.5.2shall not, by reason of his office as a director of the Company, be accountable to the Company for any benefit which he derives from any such matter, or from any such office, emplo yment or position; 
   
   85.5.3shall not be required to disclose to the Company, or use in performing his duties as a director of the Company, any confidential information relating to such matter, or such office, employment or position if to make such a disclosure or use would result in a breach of a duty or obligation of confidence owed by him in relation to or in connection with that ma tter, or that office, employment or position; and 
   
   85.5.4may absent himself from discussions, whether in meetings of the directors or otherwise, and exclude himself from information, which will or may relate to that matter, or that offic e, employment or position. 
 PROCEEDINGS OF DIRECTORS 
   
 86. PROCEDURES REGARDING BOARD MEETINGS 
   
 86.1Subject to the provisions of these articles, the directors may make any rule which they think fit about how they take decisions, and about how such rules are to be recorded or comm unicated to directors. 
   
 86.2A director may, and the secretary at the request of a director shall, call a meeting of the directors. 
   
 86.3Notice of a board meeting may be given to a director personally, or by telephone, or sent in hard copy form to him at a postal address in the United States of America notified by him to the Company for this purpose, or sent in electronic form to such electronic address (if any) as may for the time being be notified by him to the Company for that purpose. It shall not be necessary to give notice of a board meeting to a director who is for the time being absent from the United States of America unless he has requested that notices of board meetings shall during his absence be given in hard copy form or in electronic form to him at a postal address or electronic address notified by him to the Company for that purpose. Such notices, however, need not be given any earlier than notices given to directors not so absent. A director may waive notice of any board meeting and any such waiver may be  retrospective. 
   
 26 
 
 
 86.4Questions arising at a meeting shall be decided by a majority of votes. In case of an equality of votes, the chairman shall not have a second or casting vote. 
   
 86.5A meeting of the directors may consist of a conference between directors some or all of whom are in different places provided that each director who participates in the meeting is  able: 
   
   86.5.1 to hear each of the other participating directors addressing the meeting; and 
   
   86.5.2 if he so wishes, to address each of the other participating directors simultaneously, 
whether directly, by conference telephone or by any other form of communication equipment (whether in use when this article 86 is adopted or developed subsequently) or by a combination of such methods. A quorum shall be deemed to be present if those conditions are satisfied in respect of at least the number of directors required to form a quorum. A meeting held in this way shall be deemed to take place at the place where the largest group of directors is assembled or, if no such group is readily identifiable, at the place from where t he chairman of the meeting participates at the start of the meeting. 
   
 87. NUMBER OF DIRECTORS BELOW MINIMUM 
The continuing directors or a sole continuing director may act notwithstanding any vacancies in their number, but, if the number of directors is less than either the number fixed as the minimum, or the quorum required for a meeting of the directors (or both) the continuing directors or director may act only for the purpose of filling vacancies or of calling  a general meeting. 
   
 88. ELECTION AND REMOVAL OF CHAIRMAN AND LEAD DIRECTOR 
The directors may elect from their number, and remove, a chairman and a lead director of the board of directors. The chairman, or in his absence the lead director, shall preside at all meetings of the directors, but if there is no chairman or lead director, or if at the meeting neither the chairman nor the lead director is present within ten minutes after the time appointed for the meeting, or if neither of them is willing to act as chairman, the directors present may choose one of their number to be chairman of the meeting. 
   
 89. RESOLUTIONS IN WRITING 
A resolution in writing agreed to by all the directors entitled to receive notice of a meeting of the directors and who would be entitled to vote (and whose vote would have been counted) on the resolution at a meeting of the directors shall (if that number is sufficient to constitute a quorum) be as valid and effectual as if it had been passed at a meeting of the directors, duly convened and held. A resolution in writing is adopted when all such directors have signed one or more copies of it or have otherwise indicated their agreement  to it in writing. 
   
 90. QUORUM 
No business shall be transacted at any meeting of the directors unless a quorum is present. The quorum may be fixed by the directors. If the quorum is not fixed by the directors, the quorum shall be a majority of the directors in office. A director shall not be counted in the quorum present in relation to a matter or resolution on which he is not entitled to vote (or when his vote cannot be counted) but shall be counted in the quorum present in relation to all other matters or resolutions considered or voted on at the meeting. 
   
 91. PERMITTED INTERESTS AND VOTING 
   
 91.1Subject to the provisions of these articles, a director shall not vote at a meeting of the directors on any resolution concerning a matter in which he has, directly or indirectly, a material interest (other than an interest in shares, debentures or other securities of, or otherwise in or through, the Company), unless his interest arises only because the case  falls within one or more of the following: 
   
   91.1.1the resolution relates to the giving to him of a guarantee, security, or indemnity in respect of money lent to, or an obligation incurred by him for the benefit of, the Company or  any of its subsidiary undertakings; 
   
 27 
 
 
   91.1.2the resolution relates to the giving to a third party of a guarantee, security, or indemnity in respect of an obligation of the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings for which the director has assumed responsibility in whole or part and whether alone or jointly with others under a guarantee or indemnity or by the giving of security; 
   
   91.1.3the resolution relates to the giving to him of any other indemnity which is on substantially the same terms as indemnities given or to be given to all of the other directors or to the funding by the Company of his expenditure on defending proceedings or the doing by the Company of anything to enable him to avoid incurring such expenditure where all other dir ectors have been given or are to be given substantially the same arrangements; 
   
   91.1.4the resolution relates to the purchase or maintenance for any director or directors of insurance against any liability; 
   
   91.1.5his interest arises by virtue of his being, or intending to become, a participant in the underwriting or sub-underwriting of an offer of any shares in or debentures or other securi ties of the Company for subscription, purchase or exchange; 
   
   91.1.6the resolution relates to an arrangement for the benefit of the employees and directors or former employees and former directors of the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, or the members of their families (including a spouse or civil partner or a former spouse or former civil partner) or any person who is or was dependent on such persons, including but without being limited to a retirement benefits scheme and an employees' share scheme, which does not accord to any director any privilege or advantage not generally accorded  to the employees or former employees to whom the arrangement relates; or 
   
   91.1.7the resolution relates to a transaction or arrangement with any other company in which he is interested, directly or indirectly (whether as director or shareholder or otherwise), provided that he is not the holder of or beneficially interested in 1 per cent. or more of any class of the equity share capital of that company and not entitled to exercise 1 per cent. or more of the voting rights available to members of the relevant company (and for the purpose of calculating the said percentage there shall be disregarded (i) any shares held by the director as a bare or custodian trustee and in which he has no beneficial interest; (ii) any shares comprised in any authorised unit trust scheme in which the director is  interested only as a unit holder; and (iii) any shares of that class held as treasury shares). 
   
 91.2Where proposals are under consideration concerning the appointment (including the fixing or varying of terms of appointment) of two or more directors to offices or employments with the Company or any body corporate in which the Company is interested, the proposals may be divided and considered in relation to each director separately and (provided he is not for any reason precluded from voting) each of the directors concerned shall be entitled to vote and be counted in the quorum in respect of each resolution except that concerning his  own appointment. 
   
 92. SUSPENSION OR RELAXATION OF PROHIBITION ON VOTING 
The Company may by ordinary resolution suspend or relax to any extent, in respect of any particular matter, any provision of these articles prohibiting a director from voting at a  meeting of the directors or of a committee of the directors. 
   
 93. QUESTIONS REGARDING DIRECTOR'S RIGHTS TO VOTE 
If a question arises at a meeting of the directors as to the right of a director to vote, the question may, before the conclusion of the meeting, be referred to the chairman of the  meeting (or, if the director concerned is the chairman, to the other directors at the meeting), 
   
 28 
 
 
and his ruling in relation to any director other than himself (or, as the case may be, the ruling of the majority of the other directors in relation to the chairman) shall be final  and conclusive. 
 OFFICERS 
   
 94. OFFICERS 
   
 94.1The officers of the Company shall consist of a president, a secretary, a treasurer, and, if deemed necessary, expedient, or desirable by the board of directors, an executive vice president, one or more other vice presidents, one or more assistant secretaries, one or more assistant treasurers, and such other officers with such titles as the resolution of the board of directors choosing them shall designate. Except as may otherwise be provided in the resolution of the board of directors choosing him, no officer need be a director. Any n umber of offices may be held by the same person, as the directors may determine. 
   
 94.2Unless otherwise provided in the resolution choosing him, each officer shall be chosen for a term which shall continue until the meeting of the board of directors following the next annual general meeting of shareholders and until his successor shall have been chosen and qualified. 
   
 94.3All officers of the Company shall have such authority and perform such duties in the management and operation of the Company as shall be prescribed in the resolutions of the board of directors designating and choosing such officers and prescribing their authority and duties, and shall have such additional authority and duties as are incident to their office except to the extent that such resolutions may be inconsistent therewith. The secretary or an assistant secretary of the Company shall record all of the proceedings of all meetings and actions in writing of shareholders, directors, and committees of directors, and shall exercise such additional authority and perform such additional duties as the board shall assign to him. Any officer may be removed, with or without cause, by the board of directors. Any vacancy in any office may be filled by the board of directors. 
 EXECUTIVE SESSIONS 
   
 95. EXECUTIVE SESSIONS 
   
 95.1Executive sessions of the board shall be held at such time as the chairman of the board, if present and acting, shall fix, provided that the chairman is independent. Otherwise, the  lead director, if any, shall fix the time for any executive session of the board. 
   
 95.2 Executive sessions of the board shall be held at such place as shall be fixed by the board.

 DIVIDENDS 
   
 96. DECLARATION OF DIVIDENDS BY COMPANY 
The Company may by ordinary resolution declare dividends in accordance with the respective rights of the members, but no dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by the directo rs. 
   
 97. PAYMENT OF INTERIM DIVIDENDS 
The directors may pay interim dividends if it appears to them that they are justified by the profits of the Company available for distribution. If the share capital is divided into  different 
   
 29 
 
 
classes, the directors may pay interim dividends on shares which confer deferred or non-preferred rights with regard to dividend as well as on shares which confer preferential rights with regard to dividend, but no interim dividend shall be paid on shares carrying deferred or non-preferred rights if, at the time of payment, any preferential dividend is in arrear. The directors may also pay at intervals settled by them any dividend payable at a fixed rate if it appears to them that the profits available for distribution justify the payment. If the directors act in good faith they shall not incur any liability to the holders of shares conferring preferred rights for any loss they may suffer by the lawful payment  of an interim dividend on any shares having deferred or non-preferred rights. 
   
 98. PAYMENT ACCORDING TO AMOUNT PAID UP 
Except as otherwise provided by these articles or the rights attached to shares, all dividends shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid up on the shares on which the dividend is paid. If any share is issued on terms that it ranks for dividend as from a particular date, it shall rank for dividend accordingly. In any other case (and except as aforesaid), dividends shall be apportioned and paid proportionately to the amounts paid up on the shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid. For the purpose of this article 98, no account is to be taken of any amount which has been paid up on a share in advance of the due date for payment of that amount. 
   
 99. NON-CASH DISTRIBUTION 
A general meeting declaring a dividend may, upon the recommendation of the directors, direct that it shall be satisfied wholly or partly by the distribution of specific assets and in particular of fully paid shares or debentures of any other company. Where any difficulty arises in regard to the distribution, the directors may settle the same as they think fi t and in particular (but without limitation) may: 
   
   99.1.1issue fractional certificates or other fractional entitlements (or ignore fractions) and fix the value for distribution of such specific assets or any part thereof; 
   
   99.1.2determine that cash shall be paid to any member on the basis of the value so fixed in order to adjust the rights of those entitled to participate in the dividend; and 
   
   99.1.3 vest any such specific assets in trustees. 
   
 100. DIVIDEND PAYMENT PROCEDURE 
   
 100.1 Any dividend or other money payable relating to a share shall be paid to: 
   
   100.1.1 the holder; 
   
   100.1.2 if the share is held by more than one holder, all joint holders; or 
   
   100.1.3the person or persons becoming entitled to the share by reason of the death or bankruptcy of a holder or otherwise by operation of law, 
and such person shall be referred to as the "recipient" for the purposes of this article 100 and article 101. 
   
 100.2Any dividend or other money payable relating to a share shall be paid by such method as the directors decide. Without limiting any other method of payment which the directors may d ecide upon, the payments may be made, wholly or partly: 
   
   100.2.1by sending a cheque, warrant or any other similar financial instrument to the recipient by post addressed to his registered address or postal address given pursuant to article 108.4 or, in the case of joint recipients, by sending such cheque, warrant or any other similar financial instrument to the registered or postal address of whichever of the joint recipients' names appears first on the register of members, or, in the case of persons entitled by operation of law, to any such persons; 
   
 30 
 
 
   100.2.2by inter-bank transfer or any other electronic form or electronic means to an account (of a type approved by the directors) which is specified in a written instruction from the rec ipient (or, in the case of joint recipients, all joint recipients); 
   
   100.2.3in respect of shares in uncertificated form, where the Company is authorised to do so by or on behalf of the recipient (or, in the case of joint recipients, all joint recipients) in such manner as the directors may from time to time consider sufficient, by means of a relevant system; 
   
   100.2.4in some other way requested in writing by the recipients (or, in the case of joint recipients, all joint recipients) and agreed by the Company; 
   
   100.2.5in the case of a Depositary, and subject to the approval of the directors, to such persons and postal addresses as the Depositary may direct; or 
   
   100.2.6to such other person as may be set out in a written instruction from the recipient (or, in the case of joint recipients, all joint recipients), in which case payment shall be made  in accordance with articles 100.2.1 to 100.2.4 above, as specified in the written instruction. 
   
 100.3In respect of the payment of any dividend or other sum which is a distribution, the directors may decide, and notify recipients, that: 
   
   100.3.1one or more of the means described in article 100.2 will be used for payment and a recipient may elect to receive the payment by one of the means so notified in the manner prescrib ed by the directors; 
   
   100.3.2one or more of such means will be used for the payment unless a recipient elects otherwise in the manner prescribed by the directors; or 
   
   100.3.3one or more of such means will be used for the payment and that recipients will not be able to elect otherwise. 
The directors may for this purpose decide that different methods of payment may apply to different recipients or groups of recipients. 
   
 100.4All cheques, warrants and similar financial instruments are sent, and payment in any other way is made, at the risk of the person who is entitled to the money and the Company will not be responsible for a payment which is lost, rejected or delayed. The Company can rely on a receipt for a dividend or other money paid in relation to a share from any one of the joint recipients on behalf of all of them. The Company is treated as having paid a dividend if the cheque, warrant or similar financial instrument is cleared or if a payment is ma de using a relevant system or inter-bank transfer or other electronic means. 
   
 100.5 Subject to the rights attaching to any shares: 
   
   100.5.1any dividends or other monies payable on or in respect of a share may be declared or paid in such currency or currencies and using such exchange rate or such date for determining t he value or currency conversions as the directors may determine; and 
   
   100.5.2the directors can decide that a Depositary should receive dividends in a currency other than the currency in which they were declared and can make arrangements accordingly. In particular, if a Depositary has chosen or agreed to receive dividends in another currency, the directors can make arrangements with the Depositary for payment to be made to the Depositary for value on the date on which the relevant dividend is paid, or a later date decided by the directors. 
   
 101. RIGHT TO CEASE SENDING PAYMENT AND UNCLAIMED PAYMENTS 
   
 101.1The Company may cease to send any cheque or warrant, or to use any other method of payment, for any dividend payable in respect of a share if: 
   
   101.1.1in respect of at least two consecutive dividends payable on that share the cheque or warrant has been returned undelivered or remains uncashed, or another method of payment has fai led; 
   
 31 
 
 
   101.1.2in respect of one dividend payable on that share, the cheque or warrant has been returned undelivered or remains uncashed, or another method of payment has failed, and reasonable e nquiries have failed to establish any new address or account of the recipient; or 
   
   101.1.3a recipient does not specify an address, or does not specify an account of a type prescribed by the directors, or other details necessary in order to make a payment of a dividend by the means by which the directors have decided in accordance with these articles that a payment is to be made, or by which the recipient has elected to receive payment, and such address or details are necessary in order for the company to make the relevant payment in accordance with such decision or election, 
but, subject to the provisions of these articles, the Company may recommence sending cheques or warrants, or using another method of payment, for dividends payable on that share if the person or persons entitled so request and have supplied in writing a new address or account to be used for that purpose. 
   
 101.2In cases where the Company makes a payment of a dividend or other sum which is a distribution in accordance with these articles and that payment is rejected or refunded, the Company may credit that dividend or other money payable in cash to an account of the Company, to be held until the relevant recipient (or, in the case of joint recipients, all joint recipients) nominates a valid address or account to which the payment shall be made. If the Company does this, it will not be a trustee of the money and will not be liable to pay interest on it and any amount credited to an account of the Company is to be treated as having been paid to the relevant recipient (or, in the case of joint recipients, all joint recipi ents) at the time it is credited to that account. 
   
 102. NO INTEREST ON DIVIDENDS 
No dividend or other money payable in respect of a share shall bear interest against the Company, unless otherwise provided by the rights attached to the share. 
   
 103. FORFEITURE OF UNCLAIMED DIVIDENDS 
   
 103.1Any dividend or other money payable in respect of a share which has remained unclaimed for 12 years from the date when it became due for payment shall be forfeited (unless the directors decide otherwise) and shall cease to remain owing by the Company and the Company shall not be obliged to account to, or be liable in any respect to, the recipient or person w ho would have been entitled to the amount. 
   
 103.2If the Company sells the share under article 39 and two years have passed following the sale of the share, any dividend or other money payable in respect of the share outstanding at the time of sale shall be forfeited and the Company shall not be obliged to account to, or be liable in any respect to, the recipient or person who would have been entitled to th e amount. 
   
 104. SCRIP DIVIDENDS 
The directors may, with the authority of an ordinary resolution of the Company, offer any holders of ordinary shares the right to elect to receive new ordinary shares, credited as fully paid, instead of cash in respect of the whole (or some part, to be determined by the directors) of any dividend specified by the ordinary resolution. The following provisions  shall apply: 
   
 104.1The resolution may specify a particular dividend or dividends (whether or not declared), or may specify any, some or all dividends declared or payable within a specified period, but such period must not end later than the end of the third annual general meeting following the date of the meeting at which the ordinary resolution is passed. 
   
 104.2 The directors may offer such rights of election to holders either: 
   
   104.2.1 in respect of the next dividend proposed to be paid; or 
   
   104.2.2in respect of that dividend and all subsequent dividends, until such time as the election is revoked by the Company or the authority given pursuant to article 104.1 expires without  being renewed (whichever is the earlier). 
   
 32 
 
 
 104.3The entitlement of each holder of ordinary shares to new ordinary shares shall be such that the relevant value of the entitlement shall be as nearly as possible equal to (but not greater than) the cash amount (disregarding any tax credit) that such holder would have received by way of dividend. For this purpose "relevant value" shall be calculated by reference to the average of the middle market quotations for the Company's ordinary shares as derived from the NASDAQ daily list, for the day on which the ordinary shares are first quoted "ex" the relevant dividend and the four subsequent dealing days, or in such other manner as may be determined by or in accordance with the ordinary resolution. A certificate or report by the auditors as to the amount of the relevant value in respect of any dividend shall be conclusive evidence of that amount. 
   
 104.4No fraction of a share shall be allotted and the directors may make such provision for fractional entitlements as they think fit, including provision: 
   
   104.4.1for the whole or part of the benefit of fractional entitlements to be disregarded or to accrue to the Company; or 
   
   104.4.2(for the value of fractional entitlements to be accumulated on behalf of a member (without entitlement to interest) and applied in paying up new shares in connection with a subsequent offer by the Company of the right to receive shares instead of cash in respect of a future dividend. 
   
 104.5If the directors resolve to offer a right of election, they shall, after determining the basis of allotment, notify the holders of ordinary shares in writing of the right of election offered to them, and shall send with, or following, such notification, forms of election and specify the procedure to be followed and place at which, and the latest time by which, elections must be received in order to be effective. No notice need be given to a holder who has previously made (and has not revoked) an earlier election to receive new shares  in place of all future dividends. 
   
 104.6The directors may on any occasion decide that rights of election shall only be made available subject to such exclusions, restrictions or other arrangements as they shall in their absolute discretion deem necessary or desirable in order to comply with legal or practical problems under the laws of, or the requirements of any recognised regulatory body or stoc k exchange in, any territory. 
   
 104.7The dividend (or that part of the dividend in respect of which a right of election has been given) shall not be payable on ordinary shares in respect of which an election has been  duly made (" the elected ordinary shares"). Instead, additional ordinary shares shall be allotted to the holders of the elected ordinary shares on the basis of allotment determined as aforesaid. For such purpose the directors shall capitalise out of any amount for the time being standing to the credit of any reserve or fund (including any share premium account or capital redemption reserve) or any of the profits which could otherwise have been applied in paying dividends in cash, as the directors may determine, a sum equal to the aggregate nominal amount of the additional ordinary shares to be allotted on that basis and apply it in paying up in full the appropriate number of ordinary shares for allotment and distribution to the holders of the elected  ordinary shares on that basis. 
   
 104.8The directors shall not proceed with any election unless the Company has sufficient reserves or funds that may be capitalised to give effect to it after the basis of allotment is d etermined. 
   
 104.9For the purposes of a scrip dividend authorised pursuant to this article 104 only, a resolution of the directors capitalising any profits of the Company not required for paying any preferential dividend (whether or not they are available for distribution) or any sum standing to the credit of any reserve or fund of the Company (including any share premium account, capital redemption reserve, merger reserve or revaluation reserve) shall have the same effect as if such capitalisation had been declared by ordinary resolution of the Company in accordance with article 105 and the directors may, in relation to any such capitalisation, exercise all of the powers conferred on them by article 105. 
   
 33 
 
 
 104.10Unless the directors decide otherwise or the rules of a relevant system require otherwise, any new ordinary shares which a holder has elected to receive instead of cash in respect  of some or all of his dividend will be: 
   
   104.10.1shares in uncertificated form if the corresponding elected ordinary shares were uncertificated shares on the record date for that dividend; and 
   
   104.10.2shares in certificated form if the corresponding elected ordinary shares were shares in certificated form on the record date for that dividend. 
   
 104.11The additional ordinary shares when allotted shall rank pari passu in all respects with the fully paid ordinary shares then in issue except that they will not be entitled to partic ipation in the dividend in lieu of which they were allotted. 
   
 104.12The directors may do all acts and things which they consider necessary or expedient to give effect to any such capitalisation, and may authorise any person to enter on behalf of all the members interested into an agreement with the Company providing for such capitalisation and incidental matters and any agreement so made shall be binding on all concerned. 
 CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS 
   
 105. CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS 
   
 105.1 The directors may with the authority of an ordinary resolution of the Company: 
   
   105.1.1subject as provided in this article 105, resolve to capitalise any profits of the Company not required for paying any preferential dividend (whether or not they are available for distribution) or any sum standing to the credit of any reserve or fund of the Company (including any share premium account, capital redemption reserve, merger reserve or revaluation  reserve); 
   
   105.1.2appropriate the sum resolved to be capitalised to the members in proportion to the nominal amounts of the shares (whether or not fully paid) held by them respectively which would (or in the case of treasury shares, which would if such shares were not held as treasury shares) entitle them to participate in a distribution of that sum if the shares were fully paid and the sum were then distributable and were distributed by way of dividend and apply such sum on their behalf either in or towards paying up the amounts, if any, for the time being unpaid on any shares held by them respectively, or in paying up in full shares or debentures of the Company of a nominal amount equal to that sum, and allot such shares or debentures credited as fully paid to those members or as they may direct, in those proportions, or partly in one way and partly in the other, but the share premium account, the capital redemption reserve, and any profits which are not available for distribution may, for the purposes of this article 105, only be applied in paying up shares to be allotted to mem bers credited as fully paid; 
   
   105.1.3resolve that any shares so allotted to any member in respect of a holding by him of any partly paid shares shall so long as such shares remain partly paid rank for dividend only to  the extent that the latter shares rank for dividend; 
   
   105.1.4make such provision by the issue of fractional certificates or other fractional entitlements (or by ignoring fractions) or by payment in cash or otherwise as they think fit in the case of shares or debentures becoming distributable in fractions (including provision whereby the benefit of fractional entitlements accrues to the Company rather than to the membe rs concerned); 
   
   105.1.5authorise any person to enter on behalf of all the members concerned into an agreement with the Company providing for the allotment to them respectively, credited as fully paid, of any further shares to which they are entitled upon such capitalisation, any agreement made under such authority being binding on all such members; and 
   
   105.1.6 generally do all acts and things required to give effect to such resolution as aforesaid. 
   
 34 
 
 
 105.2Where, pursuant to an employees' share scheme (within the meaning of section 1166 of the Companies Act 2006): 
   
   105.2.1the Company has granted options to subscribe for shares on terms which provide (inter alia) for adjustments to the subscription price payable on the exercise of such options or to the number of shares to be allotted upon such exercise in the event of any increase or reduction in or other reorganisation of the Company's issued share capital and an otherwise appropriate adjustment would result in the subscription price for any share being less than its nominal value, then the directors may, on the exercise of any of the options concerned and payment of the subscription price which would have applied had such adjustment been made, capitalise any such profits or other sum as is mentioned in article 105.1.1 above to the extent necessary to pay up the unpaid balance of the nominal value of the shares which fall to be allotted on the exercise of such options and apply such amount in paying up s uch balance and allot shares fully paid accordingly; or 
   
   105.2.2the Company has granted (or assumed liability to satisfy) rights to subscribe for shares (whether in the form of stock options, stock units, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and units, dividend equivalent rights or otherwise) then the directors may, in connection with the issue of shares, capitalise any such profits or other sum as is mentioned in article 105.1.1 above to the extent necessary to pay up the unpaid balance of the nominal value of the shares which fall to be issued in connection with such rights to subscribe and apply such amount in paying up such balance and allot shares fully paid accordingly. 
   
 105.3The provisions of articles 105.1.1 to 105.1.6 above shall apply with the necessary alterations to this article 105.3 (but as if the authority of an ordinary resolution of the Compa ny were not required). 
   
 105.4This article 105.4 (which is without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of articles 105.1 and 105.2) applies where: 
   
   105.4.1the board has established a Rights Plan and has granted Rights in accordance therewith as provided in articles 5.1 and 5.2 above; and 
   
   105.4.2the board has exercised any discretion which may be conferred upon it by any Rights Plan so established to exchange or cause to be exchanged all or part of the Rights (other than Rights held by or on behalf of an Acquiring Person, which would have become void) for ordinary shares or shares of another class or series or all or any of them. 
For the purposes of giving effect to any such exchange as is referred to in article 105.4.2, the board may: 
   
   105.4.3resolve to capitalise an amount standing to the credit of reserves (including a share premium account, capital redemption reserve and profit and loss account), whether or not available for distribution, being an amount equal to the nominal amount of the shares or the other shares which are to be exchanged for the Rights (other than Rights held by or on behal f of an Acquiring Person) or both; and 
   
   105.4.4apply that sum in paying up in full shares and allot such shares, credited as fully paid, to: (i) the holders of Rights (other than an Acquiring Person); or (ii) a Depositary (including, for the avoidance of doubt, to a nominee of a Depositary) in exchange for the Rights (other than Rights held by or on behalf of an Acquiring Person); or (iii) both. 
   
   105.5The provisions of articles 105.1.4 and 105.1.5 shall apply (mutatis mutandis) to any resolution of the board pursuant to article 105.4 as they apply to any resolution of the board  pursuant to article 105.1.

 APPENDIX 1 
 SUMMARY OF EXAMPLE TERMS 
 RIGHTS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF ARRIS INTERNATIONAL PLC 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and every other enactment from time to time in force concerning companies (including any orders, regulations or other subordinate legislation made under the Companies Act 2006 or any such other enactment), so far as they apply to or affect ARRIS International Plc (the  "Company" ), the board of directors of the Company (the  "Board" ) may exercise any power of the Company to establish a shareholders rights plan (the  "Rights Plan"). The Rights Plan may be in such form as the Board shall in its absolute discretion decide and may in particular (but without restriction or limitation) include such terms as are  described in this Summary of Example Terms. 
 Pursuant to the Rights Plan, the Board would declare and issue one share purchase right (a  "Right" ) for each issued share of the Company (the  "Ordinary Shares"). Each Right would entitle the registered holder, upon payment to the Company of the price per Right specified in the Rights Plan, to have delivered to such holder Ordinary Shares , or shares of any other class or series as specified in the Rights Plan (a  "Share" ), subject to adjustment. 
Until the earlier to occur of: (i) 10 days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons or persons acting in concert (a  "group") has acquired beneficial ownership of or an interest in 20% or more of the issued Ordinary Shares (such person or group, an  "Acquiring Person"); and (ii) 10 business days (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board prior to such time as any person or group were to become an Acquiring Person) following the commencement of, or announcement of an intention to make, a takeover offer by a person or group the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership of or an interest in 20% or more of the issued Ordinary Shares (without duplication) being acquired by that person or group (the earlier of such dates being called the  "Distribution Date"), each Right would be associated with an individual Ordinary Share, as applicable, and the Rights would be transferred with and only with the Ordinary Shares, as applicable. 
 After the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights ( "Right Certificates") would be mailed to (or credited to the account of) holders of record of the Ordinary Shares (without duplication) as of the close of business on the Distribution Date. Such separate Right Certificates alone would then evidence the Rights and the Rights would then be separately transferable. 
The Rights would not be exercisable until the Distribution Date. The Rights would expire on a date to be specified in the Rights Plan, unless the Rights were earlier redeemed or ex changed by the Company. 
After the Distribution Date, each holder of a Right, other than Rights held by or on behalf of any Acquiring Person (which would thereupon become void), would thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of a Right that number of Shares having a market value of two times the exercise price for the Right. 
If, after a person or group were to become an Acquiring Person, the Company were to be acquired by a third party (including an Acquiring Person) in a securities exchange, proper provisions would be made so that each holder of a Right (other than Rights held by or on behalf of an Acquiring Person, which would have become void) would thereafter have the right to receive upon the exercise of a Right that number of shares of such third party (including an Acquiring Person) or its parent that at the time of such acquisition would have a ma rket value of two times the exercise price of the Right. 
At any time after any person or group were to become an Acquiring Person and prior to the acquisition by such Acquiring Person of an interest in 50% or more of the outstanding Ordinary Shares (without duplication), the Board would have the authority to exchange or cause to be exchanged the Rights (other than Rights held by or on behalf of such Acquiring Person, which would have become void), in whole or in part, for Shares at an exchange ratio of one Share per Right, subject to the receipt of any consideration required by applicable l aw to be received by the Company in respect of the same. 
   
 42 
 
 
At any time before any person or group were to become an Acquiring Person, the Board would have the authority to redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price per Right t o be specified in the Rights Plan (the  "Redemption Price" ). 
Prior to the time that any person or group became an Acquiring Person, the Board would have the authority, except with respect to the Redemption Price, to amend the Rights Plan in any manner, subject to applicable law and any restrictions set forth in the articles of the Company. After any person or group became an Acquiring Person, the Board would have the authority, except with respect to the Redemption Price, to amend the Rights Plan in any manner that would not adversely effect the interests of holders of the Rights (other than Ri ghts held by or on behalf of any Acquiring Person, which would have become void). 
Prior to the exercise of a Right, a Right would not entitle the holder thereof to any rights as a shareholder of the Company including, without limitation, the right to vote or rec eive dividends in respect of such Right.
