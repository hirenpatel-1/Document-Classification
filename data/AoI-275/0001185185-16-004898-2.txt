If such notice is mailed, it shall be deemed to have been given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his or her address as it appears on the record of stockholders of the Corporation or, if a stockholder shall have filed with the Secretary of the Corporation a written request that notices to such stockholder be mailed to some other address, then directed to such stockholder at such other address. Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders may be given by electronic transmission in the manner provided in Section 232 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. 
(b)           A written waiver of any notice of any annual or special meeting signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether given before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed the equivalent of notice. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any annual or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in such a waiver of notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting is not lawfully ca lled or convened. 
 SECTION 1.5          Quorum; Adjournment, Recess and Postponement .

When a quorum is once present to organize a meeting, it is not broken by the subsequent withdrawal of any stockholders. Where a separate vote by a class or classes or series is required, a majority of the voting power of the shares of such class or classes or series present in person or represented by proxy shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. 
(b)           The Chairman of the Meeting shall have power to adjourn or recess any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, at any time and for any reason, whether or not a quorum is present, to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice of any adjourned meeting of stockholders of the Corporation need not be given if the place, date and time thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken; provided, however, that if the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date for the adjourned meeting is fixed pursuant to Section 1.10 of these By-Laws, a notice of the adjourned meeting, conforming to the requirements of Section 1.4 of these By-Laws, shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. At an adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted on the original date of the meeting.

The meeting may be postponed or rescheduled to such time and place as is specified in the no tice of postponement or rescheduling of such meeting. 
 SECTION 1.6          Voting.  Except as otherwise required by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, all elections shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast and all other matters submitted to a meeting of stockholders shall be decided by a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively. 
 SECTION 1.7          Proxies.  Any stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders may authorize another person or persons to vote at any such meeting and express such vote on behalf of him or her by proxy. A stockholder may authorize a valid proxy by a transmission permitted by law or by executing a written instrument signed by such stockholder filed in accordance with the procedure established for the meeting. No such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after the expiration of three years from the date of such proxy, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this Section 1.7 may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission. 
 SECTION 1.8          Organization; Procedure . At every meeting of stockholders the presiding officer (the " Chairman of the Meeting") shall be an officer chosen by the Board of Directors or, in the absence of such a person, the Chairman of the Board or, in the event of his or her absence, the Chief Executive Officer. The Secretary of the Corporation or, in the event of his or her absence, an Assistant Secretary or such person as the Chairman of the Meeting appoints, shall act as secretary of the meeting.  The order of business and all other rules, regulations or matters of procedure with respect to the meeting may be determined by the Chairman of the Meeting, subject to the Board of Directors right to adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it deems appropriate. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the Chairman of the Meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (a) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (b) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (c) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the Chairman of the Meeting shall determine; (d) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; (e) restrictions on the use of audio or video recording devices at the meeting and (f) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. The Chairman of the Meeting at any meeting of stockholders, in addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter of business was not properly brought before the meeting and if the Chairman of the Meeting should so determine, the Chairman of the Meeting shall so declare to the meeting and any such matter or business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted or considered.  Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure. 
 SECTION 1.9          Stockholder Action By Written Consent . 
(a)           Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action which may be taken or required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the action were delivered to the corporation as provided herein. 
 
 5 
 
 
 
(b)           In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting (including by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission as permitted by law), the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation, first request the Board of Directors to fix a record date for such purpose, which request shall be in proper form. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten days after the date on which such a request is received or five days after delivery of any information requested by the Corporation to determine the validity of any such request or whether the action to which such request relates is an action that may be taken by written consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting, determine the validity of such request and whether such request relates to an action that may be taken by written consent of the stockholders in lieu of a meeting under this Section 1.9 and applicable law.  If such request is valid, the Board of Directors may adopt a resolution fixing the record date (unless a record date has previously been fixed by the Board of Directors pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 1.9(b)). If (x) the request required by this Section 1.9(b) has been determined to be valid and to relate to an action that may be effected by written consent in accordance with this Section 1.9 and applicable law or (y) no such determination shall have been made by the date required by this Section 1.9(b), and in either event no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to take corporate action by written consent without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or any officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.  If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action without a meeting shall be at the close of busin ess on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action. 
(c)           To be in proper form for purposes of Section 1.9(b), a request by a stockholder for the Board of Directors to fix a record date shall set forth the action proposed to be taken by written consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting and must contain such information and representations, to the extent applicable, required by the certificate of incorporation, as applicable, and these By-Laws as though such stockholder were intending to make a nomination or to bring a business proposal before a meeting of stockholders (including the notice and other procedures set forth in Section 1.2). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 1.9, upon receipt of a request by a stockholder to set a record date in order to have stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent, the Corporation may require the stockholder(s) submitting such request to furnish such other information as may be requested by the Corporation to determine the validity of the request required by this Section 1.9 and to determine whether such request relates to an action that may be effected by written consent of  stockholders in lieu of a meeting under this Section 1.9 and applicable law. 
(d)           In connection with an action or actions proposed to be taken by written consent in accordance with this Section 1.9, the stockholder seeking such action shall further update and supplement the information previously provided to the Corporation in connection therewith, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided pursuant to this Section 1.9 shall be true and correct as of the record date for determining the stockholders eligible to take such action and as of the date that is five business days prior to the date the consent solicitation is commenced, and such update and supplement shall be delivered to, or mailed and received by, the secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than five business days after the record date for determining the stockholders eligible to take such action (in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of the record date), and not later than three business days prior to the date that the consent solicitation is commenced (in the case of the update and supplement required to be made as of five business days p rior to the commencement of the consent solicitation). 
(e)           Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated consent delivered in the manner required hereby to the Corporation, written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take  action are delivered to the Corporation by delivery in a manner permitted by applicable law. 
 
 6 
 
 
 
 (f)           A facsimile, electronic mail message, or other electronic transmission (each an " electronic transmission") consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated for the purposes hereof if such electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the Corporation can determine: (a) that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the stockholder or proxyholder or by a person or persons authorized to act for the stockholder or proxyholder and (b) the date on which such stockholder or proxyholder or authorized person or persons transmitted such electronic transmission. The date on which such electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which such consent was signed. No consent given by electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until such consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery in a manner permitted by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on delivery, consents given by electronic transmission may be otherwise delivered to the principal place of business of the Corporation or to the Secretary to the extent and in the manner provided by resolution of the board of directors. 
(g)           In the event of the delivery to the Corporation of a written consent or consents purporting to represent the requisite voting power to authorize or take corporate action and/or any related revocations, the Secretary shall provide for the safekeeping of such consents and revocations. The Secretary, or such other officer of the Corporation as the Board of Directors may designate, shall, as promptly as practicable, conduct a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and/or any related revocations deemed necessary and appropriate; provided, however, that if the corporate action to which the written consent relates is the removal or replacement of one or more members of the Board of Directors, the Secretary, or such other officer of the Corporation as the Board of Directors may designate, shall promptly designate two persons, who may be employees of the Corporation, but who shall not be members of the Board of Directors or officers of the Corporation, to serve as inspectors with respect to such written consent and such inspectors shall discharge the functions of the Secretary, or such other officer of the Corporation as the Board of Directors may designate, under this Section 1.9. If after such investigation, the Secretary, such other officer of the Corporation as the Board of Directors may designate or the inspectors, as the case may be, shall determine that the action purported to have been taken is duly authorized by the consents, that fact shall be certified on the records of the Corporation kept for the purpose of recording the proceedings of meetings of shareholders and the consents shall be filed in such records. In conducting the investigation required by this Section 1.9(g), the Secretary, such other officer of the Corporation as the Board of Directors may designate or the inspectors, as the case may be, may, at the expense of the Corporation, retain special legal counsel and any other necessary or appropriate professional advisors as such person or persons may deem necessary or appropriate and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the opinion of such counsel or advisors. 
(h)           No action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the Secretary, such other officer of the Corporation as designated by the Board of Directors or inspectors as appointed in accordance with Section 1.9(g), as applicable, completes their review, determines that the consents delivered to the Corporation in accordance with this Section 1.9 represent not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted and certifies such determination to the Board of Directors for entry in the records of the Corporation kept for the purpose of recording the proceedings of meetings of stockholders.
