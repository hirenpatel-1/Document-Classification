Any determination made in accordance with the above procedures shall be binding on the Bank and the director, officer or employee. 
 
If several claims, issues or matters of action are involved, a director, officer or employee may be entitled to indemnification as to some matters even though he or she is not enti tled to indemnification as to other matters.

 Section 5.    Exceptions to Indemnification. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section to the contrary, the Bank shall not indemnify a director, officer or employee: 
 
 (a)     for any Liabilities and Expenses for which payment is actually made to or on behalf of a director, officer or employee under any valid and collectible insurance policy, except in respect of any excess Liabilities and Expenses beyond the amount of payment under such insurance policy or policies; or 
 
 (b)     for any Liabilities or Expenses incurred in a suit or claim against the director, officer or employee arising out of or based upon actions attributable to the director, officer or employee in which the director, officer or employee gained any personal profit or advantage to which he or she was not legally entitled; provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 5(b) shall not be deemed to prohibit indemnification of Expenses incurred by a director, officer or employee of the Bank in a Proceeding against the director, officer or employee for return of compensation paid to such person in the normal course of business of the Bank unless (i) the director, officer or employee breached or failed to perform his or her duties as a director, officer or employee in compliance with the Standard of Conduct and (ii) with respect to any action or failure to act by the director, officer or employee which is at issue in such suit or claim, such action or failure to act constituted willful misconduct or recklessness. 
 
 Section 6.    Notification and Defense of Proceeding .  Promptly after receipt by a director, officer or employee of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding, the director, officer or employee will, if a request for indemnification in respect thereof is to be made against the Bank under this Article VII, notify the Bank of the commencement thereof; but the failure to so notify the Bank will not relieve it from any obligation which it may have to the director, officer or employee under this Article VII or otherwise. With respect to any such Proceeding as to which the director, officer o r employee notifies the Bank of the commencement thereof: 
 
 (a)      the Bank will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense; 
 
 (b)     except as otherwise provided below, to the extent that it may so desire, the Bank, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, will be entitled to assume the defe nse thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the director, officer or employee. 
 
After notice from the Bank to the director, officer or employee of its election to assume the defense of the director, officer or employee in the Proceeding, the Bank will not be liable to the director, officer or employee under this Article VII for any legal or other Expenses subsequently incurred by the director, officer or employee in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation or as otherwise provided below. The director, officer or employee shall have the right to employ counsel in such Proceeding, but the Expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Bank of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be at the expense of the director, officer or employee unl ess: 
 
 (i)      the employment of counsel by the director, officer or employee has been authorized by the Bank; 
 
 
 14 
 
 
 
 
 (ii)     the director, officer or employee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Bank and the director, officer or employee in the conduct of  the defense of such Proceeding; or 
 
 (iii)      the Bank shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such Proceeding; 
 
in each of which cases the Expenses of counsel employed by the director, officer or employee shall be paid by the Bank. The Bank shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Proceeding brought by or in the right of the Bank or as to which the director, officer or employee shall have made the conclusion provided for in (ii) above; and 
 
 (c)     the Bank shall not be liable to indemnify a director, officer or employee under this Article VII for any amounts paid in settlement of any Proceeding without the Bank's prior written consent. The Bank shall not settle any action or claim in any manner which would impose any penalty or limitation on a director, officer or employee without the prior written consent of the director, officer or employee. Neither the Bank nor a director, officer or employee will unreasonably withhold its, his or her consent to any proposed settlement. 
 
 Section 7.   Enforcement .  Any indemnification under this Article VII shall be made promptly (but in no event later than forty-five (45) days) after the director, officer or employee has been wholly successful on the merits or otherwise with respect to any Proceeding or upon the determination in accordance with Section 3(b) of this Article VII that the director, officer or employee is entitled to indemnification. Any advancement of Expenses under this Article VII shall be made promptly (but in no event later than forty-five (45) days) after receipt by the Bank of a written request from the person seeking advancement of Expenses including a written affirmation of such person's belief that he or she has met the applicable Standard of Conduct and such person's written undertaking to repay all amounts so advanced (as required by Section 4 of this Article VII). Any right of a director, officer or employee to indemnification or advancement of Expenses as granted by this Article VII may be enforceable by such director, officer or employee in any court of competent jurisdiction, (subject, however, to any mandatory arbitration agreement between an employee and the Bank which shall require disputes between the employee and the Bank to be arbitrated as required therein), if the Bank denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition thereof is made within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Bank of request therefor. 
 
 Section 8. Other Rights and Remedies. The rights of indemnification provided under this Article VII are not exhaustive and shall be in addition to any rights to which a director, officer or employee may otherwise be entitled by contract, bylaw, shareholder vote or as a matter of law. Irrespective of the provisions of this Article VII, the Bank may, at any time and from time to time, indemnify directors, officers, employees and other persons to the full extent permitted by applicable law, whether with regard to past or future matters.

 Section 10. Insurance.

 Section 11 .   Contractual Rights and Applicability .  It is the intent of this Article VII to empower the Bank to provide indemnification and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent allowed by law. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, indemnification shall be provided without regard to the legal or equitable theory of the Proceeding, including but not limited to criminal claims, conspiracy claims, joint, several, comparative or sole negligence, breach of contract or warranty, strict liability, breach of fiduciary duty, mismanagement, corporate waste, or violation of federal or state securities law or any other law, regulation or policy. The right to be indemnified or be reimbursed or advanced expenses pursuant hereto (a) is a contract right based upon good and valuable consideration, pursuant to which the person entitled thereto may bring suit as if the provisions thereof were set forth in a separate written contract between the person and the Bank, (b) is intended to be retroactive and shall be available with respect to events occurring prior to the adoption hereof, (c) shall continue to exist after the rescission or restrictive modification hereof with respect to events occurring prior thereto, and (d) shall inure to the benefit of the heirs and personal representatives of an y present or former director, officer, or employee. 
 
If any portion of this Article VII shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, or in any arbitration proceeding, then the Bank shall nevertheless indemnify each person entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses under this Article VII as to all Liabilities and Expenses actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such person and for which indemnification is available to such person pursuant to this Article VII to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article VII that s hall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
