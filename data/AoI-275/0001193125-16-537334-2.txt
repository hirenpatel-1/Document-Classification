If the Partnership participates in any acquisition of the Partnership by another entity, any combination of the Partnership with another entity through a merger or consolidation, or any conversion of the Partnership into another form of business entity (such as a corporation) that requires the approval of the outstanding limited partnership interest, the result of which would cause the other entity to issue securities to the Limited Partners, then each Limited Partner who does not approve of such reorganization (the "Dissenting Limited Partner") may require the Partnership to purchase for cash, at its fair market value, the interest of the Dissenting Limited Partner in the Partnership in accordance with Section 15679.2 of the California Corporations Code. The Partnership, however, may itself convert to another form of business entity (such as a corporation, trust or association) if the conversion will not result in a significant adverse change in (i) the voting rights of the Limited Partners, (ii) the termination date of the Partnership (currently, December 31, 2032, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the Partnership Agreement), (iii) the compensation payable to the General Partners or the ir Affiliates, or (iv) the Partnership's investment objectives. 
The General Partners will make the determination as to whether or not any such conversion will result in a significant adverse change in any of the provisions listed in the preceding paragraph based on various factors relevant at the time of the proposed conversion, including an analysis of the historic and projected operations of the Partnership; the tax consequences (from the standpoint of the Limited Partners) of the conversion of the Partnership to another form of business entity and of an investment in a limited partnership as compared to an investment in the type of business entity into which the Partnership would be converted; the historic and projected operating results of the Partnership's Loans, and the then-current value and marketability of the Partnership's Loans. In general, the General Partners would consider any material limitation on the voting rights of the Limited Partners or any substantial increase in the compensation payable to the General Partners or their Affiliates to be a significant adverse change in the listed provisions. 
3.16 Exculpation and Indemnification. The General Partners shall have no liability whatsoever to the Partnership or to any Limited Partner, so long as a General Partner determined in good faith, that the course of conduct which caused the loss or liability was in the best interests of the Partnership, and such loss or liability did not result from the gross negligence or gross misconduct of the General Partner being held harmless. The General Partners or any Partnership employee or agent shall be entitled to be indemnified by the Partnership, at the expense of the Partnership, against any loss or liability (including attorneys' fees, which shall be paid as incurred) resulting from assertion of any claim or legal proceeding relating to the activities of the Partnership, including claims, or legal proceedings brought by a third party or by Limited Partners, on their own behalf or as a Partnership derivative suit, so long as the party to be indemnified determined in good faith that the course of conduct which gave rise to such claim or proceeding was in the best interests of the Partnership and such course of conduct did not constitute gross negligence or gross misconduct; provided, however, any such indemnification shall only be recoverable out of the assets of the Partnership and not from Limited Partners. Nothing herein shall prohibit the Partnership from paying in whole or in part the premiums or other charge for any type of indemnity insurance by which the General Partners or other agents or employees of the Partnership are indemnified or insured against liability or loss arising out of their actual or asserted misfeasance or nonfeasance in the performance of their duties or out of any actual or asserted wrongful act against the Partnership including, but not limited to judgments, fines, settlements and expenses incurred in the defense of actions, proceedings and appeals therefrom. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the General Partners nor their affiliates shall be indemnified for any liability imposed by judgment (including costs and attorneys' fees) arising from or out of a violation of state or federal securities laws associated with the offer and sale of Units offered hereby. However, indemnification will be allowed for settlements and related expenses of lawsuits alleging securities law violations and for expenses incurred in successfully defending such lawsuits provided that (a) a court either approves indemnification of litigation costs if the General Partners are successful in defending the action; or (b) the settlement and indemnification is specifically approved by the court of law which shall have been advised as to the current position of the Securities and Exchange Commission (as to any claim involving allegations that the Securities Act of 1933 was violated) and California Commissioner of Corporations or the applicable state authority (as to any claim involving allegations that the applicable state's securities laws were violated).

Upon the admission of additional Limited Partners to the Partnership pursuant to Section 4.2(b) of this Agreement, the Partnership promptly refunded to the Initial Limited Partner its $1,000 capital contribution and upon receipt of such sum the Initial Limited Partner was withdrawn from the Partnership as its Initial Limited Partner. 
(b) Capital Contributions of Existing Limited Partners. The existing Limited Partners have contributed in the aggregate to the capital of the Partnership an amount equal to $172,22 3,000 as of December 31, 2004.

The total additional capital contributions of the New Limited Partners will not exceed $100,000,000. 
(d) Escrow Account. No escrow account will be established and all proceeds from the sale of Units will be remitted directly to the Partnership. 
Subscription Agreements shall be accepted or rejected within 30 days of their receipt. All subscription monies deposited by persons whose subscriptions are rejected shall be returned to such subscribers forthwith after such rejection without interest. The public offering of Units shall terminate one year from the effective date of the Prospectus unless fully subscribed at an earlier date or terminated on an earlier date by the General Partners, or unless extended by the General Partners for additional one year periods. 
(e) Subscription Account. Subscriptions received after the activation of the Partnership will be deposited into a subscription account at a federally insured commercial bank or other depository and invested in short-term certificates of deposit, a money market or other liquid asset account. Prospective investors whose subscriptions are accepted will be admitted into the Partnership only when their subscription funds are required by the Partnership to fund a Loan, or the Formation Loan, to create appropriate reserves or to pay organizational expenses or other proper Partnership purposes. During the period prior to admittance of investors as Limited Partners, proceeds from the sale of Units are irrevocable, and will be held by the General Partners for the account of Limited Partners in the subscription account. Investors' funds will be transferred from the subscription account into the Partnership on a first-in, first-out basis. Upon admission to the Partnership, subscription funds will be released to the Partnership and Units will be issued at the rate of $1 per unit or fraction thereof. Interest earned on subscription funds while in the subscription account will be returned to the subscriber, or if the subscriber elects to compound earnings, the amount equal to such interest will be added to his investment in the Partnership, and the number of Units actually issued shall be increased accordingly. In the event only a portion of a subscribing Limited Partner's funds are required, then all funds invested by such subscribing Limited Partners at the same time shall be transferred. Any subscription funds remaining in the subscription account after the expiration of one (1) year from the date any such subscription funds were first received by the General Partners shall be retu rned to the subscriber. 
(f) Admission of Limited Partners. Subscribers shall be admitted as Limited Partners when their subscription funds are required by the Partnership to fund a Loan, or the Formation Loan, to create appropriate reserves or to pay organizational expenses, as described in the Prospectus.

Rejected subscriptions and monies shall be returned to subscribers forthwith. 
The Partnership shall amend Schedule A to the Limited Partnership Agreement from time to time to effect the substitution of substituted Limited Partners in the case of assignments, where the assignee does not become a substituted Limited Partner, the Partnership shall recognize the assignment not later than the last day of the calendar month following accept ance of the assignment by the General Partners. 
No person shall be admitted as a Limited Partner who has not executed and filed with the Partnership the subscription form specified in the Prospectus used in connection with the public offering, together with such other documents and instruments as the General Partners may deem necessary or desirable to effect such admission, including, but not limited to, the execution, acknowledgment and delivery to the General Partners of a power of attorney in form and substance as described in Section 2.8 hereof.

4.3 Election to Receive Monthly, Quarterly or Annual Cash Distributions. Upon subscription for Units, a subscribing Limited Partner must elect whether to receive monthly, quarterly or annual cash distributions from the Partnership or to have earnings retained in his Capital Account that will increase it in lieu of receiving periodic cash distributions. If the Limited Partner initially elects to receive monthly, quarterly or annual distributions, such election, once made, is irrevocable. However, a Limited Partner may change his election regarding whether he wants to receive such distributions on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. If the Limited Partner initially elects to have earnings retained in his Capital Account in lieu of cash distributions, he may after three (3) years, change his election and receive monthly, quarterly or annual cash distributions. Earnings allocable to Limited Partners who elect to have earnings retained in their Capital Account will have earnings retained by the Partnership to be used for making further Loans or for other proper Partnership purposes. The Earnings from such further Loans will be allocated among all Partners; however, Limited Partners who elect to have earnings retained in their Capital Account will be credited with an increasingly larger proportionate share of such Earnings than Limited Partners who receive monthly, quarterly or annual distributions since Limited Partners' Capital Accounts who elect to have earnings retained in their Capital Accounts will increase over time. Annual distributions will be made at the end of the calendar year. 
4.4 Interest. No interest shall be paid on, or in respect of, any contribution to Partnership Capital by any Partner, nor shall any Partner have the right to demand or receive cash  or other property in return for the Partner's capital contribution. 
4.5 Loans. Any Partner or Affiliate of a Partner may, with the written consent of the General Partners, lend or advance money to the Partnership. If the General Partners or, with the written consent of the General Partners, any Limited Partner shall make any loans to the Partnership or advance money on its behalf, the amount of any such loan or advance shall not be treated as a contribution to the capital of the Partnership, but shall be a debt due from the Partnership. The amount of any such loan or advance by a lending Partner or an Affiliate of a Partner shall be repayable out of the Partnership's cash and shall bear interest at a rate of not in excess of the greater of (i) the prime rate established, from time to time, by any major bank selected by the General Partners for loans to the bank's most creditworthy commercial borrowers, plus 5% per annum, or (ii) the maximum rate permitted by law. None of the Partners or their Affiliates shall be obligated to make any loan or advance to the Partnership.

Unless otherwise specified, all meetings of the Partnership shall be held at 2:00 P.M. at the office of the Partnership, upon not less than ten (10) and not more than sixty (60) days written notice. At any meeting of the Partnership, Limited Partners may vote in person or by proxy. A majority of the Limited Partners, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at any Partnership meeting. Any question relating to the Partnership which may be considered and acted upon by the Limited Partners hereunder may be considered and acted upon by vote at a Partnership meeting, and any consent required to be in writing shall be deemed given by a vote by written ballot.

4.10 Representation of Partnership. Each of the Limited Partners hereby acknowledges and agrees that the attorneys representing the Partnership and the General Partners and their Affiliates do not represent and shall not be deemed under the applicable codes of professional responsibility to have represented or be representing any or all of the Limited Partners in any respect at any time. Each of the Limited Partners further acknowledges and agrees that such attorneys shall have no obligation to furnish the Limited Partners with any information or documents obtained, received or created in connection with the representation of the Partnership, the General Partners and/or their Affiliates. 
 ARTICLE 5 
 PROFITS AND LOSSES; CASH DISTRIBUTIONS 
5.1 Profits and Losses. All Profits and Losses of the Partnership shall be credited to and charged against the Partners in proportion to their respective "Partnership Interests", as hereafter defined. The Partnership Interest of the General Partners shall at all times be a total of one percent (1%), to be shared equally among them and the Partnership Interest of the Limited Partners collectively shall be ninety-nine percent (99%), which shall be allocated among them according to their respective Limited Partnership Interests. Profits and Losses realized by the Partnership during any month shall be allocated to the Partners as of the close of business on the last day of each calendar month, in accordance with their respective Limited Partnership Interests and in proportion to the number of days during such month that they owned such Limited Partnership Interests, without regard to Profits  and Losses realized with respect to time periods within such month. 
5.2 Cash Earnings. Earnings as of the close of business on the last day of each calendar month shall be allocated among the Partners in the same proportion as Profits and Losses as described in Section 5.1 above. Earnings allocable to those Limited Partners who elect to receive cash distributions as described below shall be distributed to them in cash as soon as practicable after the end of each calendar month. The General Partners' allocable share of Earnings shall also be distributed concurrently with cash distributions to Limited Partners. Earnings allocable to those Limited Partners who elected to have earnings retained in his or her Capital Account shall be retained by the Partnership and credited to their respective Capital Accounts as of the first day of the succeeding calendar month. Earnings to Limited Partners shall be distributed only to those Limited Partners who elect in writing, upon their initial subscription for the purchase of Units or after three (3) years to receive such distributions during the term of the Partnership. Each Limited Partner's decision whether to receive such distributions shall be irrevocable, except as set forth in paragraph 4.3 above. 
5.3 Cash Distributions Upon Termination. Upon dissolution and termination of the Partnership, Cash Available for Distribution shall thereafter be distributed to Partners in accorda nce with the provisions of Section 9.3 below. 
 5.4 Special Allocation Rules. 
(a) For purposes of this Agreement, a loss or allocation (or item thereof) is attributable to non-recourse debt which is secured by Partnership property to the extent of the excess of the outstanding principal balance of such debt (excluding any portion of such principal balance which would not be treated as an amount realized under Internal Revenue Code Section 1001 and Paragraph (a) of Section 1.1001-2) if such debt were foreclosed upon over the adjusted basis of such property. This excess is herein defined as "Minimum Gain" (whether taxable as capital gain or as ordinary income) as more explicitly set forth in Treasury Regulation 1.704-2. Notwithstanding any other provision of Article 5, the allocation of loss or deduction or item thereof, attributable to non-recourse debt which is secured by Partnership property will be allowed only to the extent that such allocation does not cause the sum of the deficit capital account balances of the Limited Partners receiving such allocations to exceed the minimum gain determined at the end of the Partnership able year to which the allocations relate. The balance of such losses shall be allocated to the General Partners. Any Limited Partner with a deficit capital account balance resulting in whole or in part from allocations of loss or deduction (or item thereof) attributable to non-recourse debt which is secured by Partnership property shall, to the extent possible, be allocated income or gain (or item thereof) in an amount not less than the minimum gain at a time no later than the time at which the minimum gain is reduced below the sum of such deficit capital account balances. This section is intended and shall be interpreted to comply with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(f). 
   
 11 
 
 
(b) In the event any Limited Partner receives any adjustments, allocations or distributions, not covered by Section 5.4(a), so as to result in a deficit capital account, items of Partnership income and gain shall be specially allocated to such Limited Partners in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate the deficit balances in their Capital Accounts created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as quickly as possible. This Section shall operate a qualified income offset as utilized in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704- 1(b)(2)(ii)(d). 
(c) Syndication expenses for any fiscal year or other period shall be specially allocated to the Limited Partners in proportion to their Units, provided that if additional Limited Partners are admitted to the Partnership on different dates, all syndication expenses shall be divided among the Persons who own Units from time to time so that, to the extent possible, the cumulative Syndication Expenses allocated with respect to each Unit at any time is the same amount. In the event the General Partners shall determine that such result is not likely to be achieved through future allocations of syndication expenses, the General Partners may allocate a portion of Net Profits or Losses so as to achieve the same effect on the Capital Accounts of the Limited Partners, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement. 
(d) For purposes of determining the Net Profits, Net Losses, or any other items allocable to any period, Net Profits, Net Losses, and any such other items shall be determined on a daily, monthly, or other basis, as determined by the General Partners using any permissible method under Code Section 706 and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. 
(e) Notwithstanding Section 5.1 and 5.2 hereof, (i) Net Losses allocable to the period prior to the admission of any additional Limited Partners pursuant to Section 4.2(b) and (e) hereof shall be allocated 99% to the General Partners and 1% to the Initial Limited Partner and Net Profits during that same period, if any, shall be allocated to the General Partners, and (ii) Profits or Losses allocable to the period commencing with the admission of any additional such Limited Partners and all subsequent periods shall be allocated pursuant  to Section 5.1. 
(f) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all items of Partnership profit, gain, loss, deduction, and any other allocations not otherwise provided for shall be divided among the Partners in the same proportions as they share Net Profits or Net Losses, as the case may be, for the year. 
(g) The General Partners may adopt any procedure or convention they deem reasonable to account for unsolicited investments made by Limited Partners and the payment of a portion of  the Formation Loan to such Partners' Capital Account. 
5.5 704(c) Allocations. In accordance with Code 704(c) and the Treasury Regulations thereunder income, gain, loss, and deduction with respect to any property contributed to the capital of the Partnership shall, solely for tax purposes, be allocated among the Partners so as to take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such property to the Pa rtnership for federal income tax purposes and its initial fair market value. 
Any elections or other decisions relating to such allocations shall be made by the General Partners in any manner that reasonably reflects the purpose and intention of this Agreement. Allocations pursuant to this Section 5.5 are solely for purposes of federal, state, and local taxes and shall not affect, or in any way be taken into account in computing, any Person's Capital Account or share of Profits, Losses, other items, or distributions pursuant to any provision of this Agreement. 
5.6 Intent of Allocations. It is the intent of the Partnership that this Agreement comply with the safe harbor test set out in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(D) and 1.704-l(b)(4)(iv)(D) and the requirements of those Sections, including the qualified income offset and minimum gain chargeback, which are hereby incorporated by reference. If, for whatever reasons, the Partnership is advised by counsel or its accountants that the allocation provisions of this Agreement are unlikely to be respected for federal income tax purposes, the General Partners are granted the authority to amend the allocation provisions of this Agreement, to the minimum extent deemed necessary by counsel or its accountants to effect the plan of allocations and distributions provided in this Agreement. The General Partners shall have the discretion to adopt and revise rules, conventions and procedures as it believes appropriate with respect to the admission of Limited Partners to reflect Partners' interests in the Partnership at the close of the years.

8.1 Withdrawal by Limited Partners. No Limited Partner shall have the right to withdraw from the Partnership, receive cash distributions or otherwise obtain the return of all or any portion of his Capital Account balance for a period of one year after such Limited Partner's initial purchase of Units, except for monthly, quarterly or annual distributions of Cash Available for Distribution, if any, to which such Limited Partner may be entitled pursuant to Section 5.2 above and except in the event of the Limited Partner's death within the first year of his or her purchase of units. Withdrawal after a minimum one year holding period and before the five year holding period as set forth below shall be permitted in accordance with subsection (a) below. The General Partners shall have the right to liquidate the capital account of any investor whose capital account balance is less than $1,000. No penalty will be assessed in connection with a liquidation of a capital account of less than $1,000 by a General Partner. Additionally, as set forth below in subsection (g) there shall be a limited right of withdrawal upon the death of a Limited Partner. If a Limited Partner elects to withdraw either after the one (1) year holding period or the five (5) year holding period or his heirs elect to withdraw after his death, he will continue to receive distributions or have those Earnings compounded depending upon his initial election, based upon the balance of his capital account during the withdrawal period. Limited Partners may also withdraw after a five year holding period in accordance with subsection b(i) and (ii). A Limited Partner may withdraw or partially withdraw from the Partnership upon the following terms: 
(a) A Limited Partner who desires to withdraw from the Partnership after the expiration of the above referenced one year period shall give written notice of withdrawal ("Notice of Withdrawal") to the General Partners, which Notice of Withdrawal shall state the sum or percentage interests to be withdrawn. Subject to the provisions of subsections (e) and (f) below, such Limited Partner may liquidate part or all of his entire Capital Account in four equal quarterly installments beginning the last day of the quarter following the quarter in which the Notice of Withdrawal is given, provided that such notice was received thirty (30) days prior to the end of the quarter. An early withdrawal under this subsection (a) shall be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty applicable to the sum withdrawn as stated in the Notice of Withdrawal. The 10% penalty shall be subject to and payable upon the te rms set forth in subsection (c) below. 
(b) A Limited Partner who desires to withdraw from the Partnership after the expiration of the above referenced five year period shall give written notice of withdrawal ("Notice of Withdrawal") to the General Partners, and subject to the provisions of subsections (e) and (f) below such Limited Partner's Capital Account shall be liquidated as follows: 
(i) Except as provided in subsection (b)(ii) below, the Limited Partner's Capital Account shall be liquidated in twenty (20) equal quarterly installments each equal to 5% of the total Capital Account beginning the last day of the calendar quarter following the quarter in which the Notice of Withdrawal is given, provided that such notice is received thirty (30) days prior to the end of the preceding quarter. Upon approval by the General Partners, the Limited Partner's Capital Account may be liquidated upon similar terms over a period l onger than twenty (20) equal quarterly installments. 
(ii) Notwithstanding subsection (b)(i) above, any Limited Partner may liquidate part or all of his entire outstanding Capital Account in four equal quarterly installments beginning of the last day of the calendar quarter following the preceding quarter in which Notice of Withdrawal is given, provided that such notice was received thirty (30) days prior to the end of the preceding quarter. An early withdrawal under this subsection 8.1(b)(ii) shall be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty applicable to any sums prior to the time when such sums could have been withdrawn pursuant to the withdrawal provisions set forth in subsection (a)(i) above. 
(c) The 10% early withdrawal penalty will be deducted pro rata from the Limited Partner's Capital Account. The 10% early withdrawal penalty will be received by the Partnership, and a portion of the sums collected as such early withdrawal penalty shall be applied by the Partnership toward the next installment(s) of principal under the Formation Loan owed to the Partnership by Redwood Mortgage Corp., a General Partner and any successor firm, as described in Section 10.9 below. This portion shall be determined by the ratio between the initial amount of the Formation Loan and the total amount of the organizational and syndication costs incurred by the Partnership in this offering of Units. After the Formation Loan has been paid, the 10% early withdrawal penalty will be used to pay the Continuing Servicing Fee, as set forth in Section 10.13 below. The balance of such early withdrawal penaltie s shall be retained by the Partnership for its own account. 
(d) Commencing with the end of the calendar month in which such Notice of Withdrawal is given, and continuing on or before the twentieth day after the end of each month thereafter, any Cash Available for Distribution allocable to the Capital Account (or portion thereof) with respect to which Notice of Withdrawal has been given shall also be distributed in ca sh to the withdrawing Limited Partner in the manner provided in Section 5.2 above.

(e) During the liquidation period described in subsections 8.1(a) and (b), the Capital Account of a withdrawing Limited Partner shall remain subject to adjustment as described in Section 1.4 above. Any reduction in said Capital Account by reason of an allocation of Losses, if any, shall reduce all subsequent liquidation payments proportionately. In no event shall any Limited Partner receive cash distributions upon withdrawal from the Partnership if the effect of such distribution would be to create a deficit in such Limited Partner's  Capital Account. 
(f) Payments to withdrawing Limited Partners shall at all times be subject to the availability of sufficient cash flow generated in the ordinary course of the Partnership's business, and the Partnership shall not be required to liquidate outstanding Loans prior to their maturity dates for the purposes of meeting the withdrawal requests of Limited Partners. For this purpose, cash flow is considered to be available only after all current Partnership expenses have been paid (including compensation to the General Partners and Affiliates) and adequate provision has been made for the payment of all monthly or annual cash distributions on a pro rata basis which must be paid to Limited Partners who elected to receive such distributions upon subscription for Units pursuant to Section 4.3 or who changed their initial election to compound Earnings as set forth in Section 4.3. Furthermore, no more than 20% of the total Limited Partners' Capital Accounts outstanding for the beginning of any calendar year shall be liquidated during any calendar year. The General Partners also have the discretion to adjust the timing of withdrawals that would otherwise be made during a taxable year, including deferring withdrawals indefinitely, if the scheduled withdrawals could result in the Partnership being classified as a "publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code or any regulations of rules promulgated thereunder. If Notices of Withdrawal in excess of these limitations are received by the General Partners, the priority of distributions among Limited Partners shall be determined as follows: first, to those Limited Partners withdrawing Capital Accounts according to the 20 quarter or longer installment liquidation period described under subsection (b)(i) above, then to Benefit Plan Investors withdrawing Capital Accounts under subsection (b)(ii) above, then to all other Limited Partners withdrawing Capital Accounts under subsection (b)(ii) above, then to Administrators withdrawing Capital Accounts under subsection (g) below, and finally to all other Limited Partners withdrawing Capital Accounts under subsection (a) a bove. 
(g) Upon the death of a Limited Partner, a Limited Partner's heirs or executors may, subject to certain conditions as set forth herein, liquidate all or a part of the deceased Limited Partner's investment without penalty. An executor, heir or other administrator of the Limited Partner's estate (for ease of reference the "Administrator") shall give written notice of withdrawal ("Notice of Withdrawal") to the General Partners within 6 months of the Limited Partner's date of death or the investment will become subject to the liquidation provisions set forth in Section 8.1 (a) through (f) above. The total amount available to be liquidated in any one year shall be limited to $50,000 per Limited Partner. The liquidation of the Limited Partner's Capital Account in any one year shall be made in four equal quarterly installments beginning the last day of the calendar quarter following the quarter in which time the Notice of Withdrawal is received. Due to the complex nature of administering a decedent's estate, the General Partners reserve the right and discretion to request any and all information they deem necessary and relevant in determining the date of death, the name of the beneficiaries and/or any other matters they deem relevant. The General Partners retain the discretion to refuse or to delay the liquidation of a deceased Limited Partner's investment unless or until the General Partners have received all such information they deem relevant. The liquidation of a Limited Partner's Capital Account pursuant to this subsection is subject to the provisions of subsections 8.1(d), (e) and (f) above.

Such payment shall be due and payable by December 31 of the following year.

 10.13 Sales Commissions. 
(a) The Units are being offered to the public on a best efforts basis through the participating broker-dealers. The participating broker-dealers may receive commissions as follows: at the rate of either (5%) or (9%) (depending upon the investor's election to receive cash distributions or to compound earnings) of the gross proceeds on all of their sales. In no event will the total of all compensation payable to participating broker dealers, including sales commissions, expense reimbursements, including reimbursements for education meetings for associated persons of an NASD member, and/or due diligence expenses exceed ten percent (10%) of the program proceeds received plus an additional (0.5%) for bona fide due diligence expenses as set forth in Rule 2810 of the NASD Conduct Rules. Further, in no event shall any individual participating broker dealer receive total compensation including sales commissions, expense reimbursements, including reimbursements for education meetings for associated persons of an NASD member, or expense reimbursement exceed (10%) of the gross proceeds of their sales plus an additional (0.5%) for bona fide due diligence expenses as set forth in Rule 2810 of the NASD Conduct Rules (the "Compensation Limitation"). In the event the Partnership receives any unsolicited orders directly from an investor who did not utilize the services of a participating broker dealer, Redwood Mortgage Corp. through the Formation Loans may pay to the Partnership an amount equal to the amount of the sales commissions otherwise attributable to a sale of a Unit through a participating broker dealer. The Partnership will in turn credit such amounts received from Redwood Mortgage Corp. to the account of the Investor who placed the unsolicited order. All unsolicited orders wil l be handled only by the General Partners. 
Sales commissions will not be paid by the Partnership out of the offering proceeds. All sales commissions will be paid by Redwood Mortgage Corp., which will also act as the mortgage loan broker for all Loans as set forth in Section 10.1 above. With respect to the initial offering of 150,000 Units, the Continuing Servicing Fee will be paid by Redwood Mortgage Corp., but will not be included in the first Formation Loan. The Partnership will loan to Redwood Mortgage Corp. funds in an amount equal to the sales commissions and all amounts payable in connection with unsolicited sales by the General Partners, as a Formation Loan. With respect to the initial offering of 150,000 Units, Redwood Mortgage Corp. will use the proceeds from loan brokerage commissions on Loans to pay the Continuing Servicing Fees, and if all or any one of the initial General Partners is removed as a General Partner by the vote thereafter designated, if such successor or additional General Partner(s) use any other loan brokerage firm for the placement of Loans, Redwood Mortgage Corp. will be immediately released from any further obligation to continue to pay any Continuing Servicing Fees. In addition, if all of the General Partners are removed, no successor General Partners are elected, the Partnership is liquidated and Redwood Mortgage Corp. is no longer receiving any payments for services rendered, Redwood Mortgage Corp. will be immediately released from any further obligation to continue to pay any Continuing Servicing Fee in connection with the initial offering of 150,000 Units. Units may also be offered or sold directly by the General Partners for which they will receive no sales commissions. The Partnership shall reimburse Participating Broker-Dealers for bona fide due diligence expenses in an amo unt up to (.5%) of the Gross Proceeds. 
(b) Sales by Registered Investment Advisors. The General Partners may accept unsolicited orders received directly from Investors if an investor utilizes the services of a registered investment advisor. A registered investment advisor is an investment professional retained by a Limited Partner to advise him regarding all of his assets, not just an investment in the Partnership. Registered investment advisors are paid by the investor based upon the total amount of the investor's assets being managed by the registered investment advisor. 
If an investor utilizes the services of a registered investment advisor, Redwood Mortgage Corp. may pay to the Partnership an amount equal to the sales commission otherwise attributable to a sale of Units through a participating broker dealer. The Partnership will in turn credit such amounts received by Redwood Mortgage Corp. to the account of the investor who placed the unsolicited order. If an investor acquires Units directly through the services of a registered investment advisor, the investor will have the election to authorize the Partnership to pay the registered investment advisor an estimated monthly amount of no more than 2% annually of his capital account that would otherwise be paid as periodic cash distributors or compounded as earnings. For ease of reference, these fees are referred to as "Client Fees." The payment of Client Fees will be paid from those amounts that would otherwise be distributable to a Limited Partner or compounded in a Limited Partner's capital account. The payment of Client Fees is noncumulative and subject to the availability of sufficient earnings in your capital account. In no event will any such Client Fees be paid to us as sales commissions or other compensation. The Partnership is merely agreeing as an administrative convenience to pay the registered investment advisor a portion of those amounts that would be paid to you. 
All registered investment advisors will be required to represent and warrant to the Partnership, that among other things, the investment in the units is suitable for the Investor, that he has informed the Investor of all pertinent facts relating to the liquidating and marketability of the units, and that if he is affiliated with a NASD registered broker or dealer, that all Client Fees received by him in connection with any transactions with the Partnership will be run through the books and records of the NASD member in compliance with  Notice to Members 96-33 and Rules 3030 and 3040 of the NASD Conduct Rules.

The General Partners may, at their election, pay any offering and organization expenses in  excess of this amount. 
10.15 Reimbursement. The Partnership shall reimburse the General Partners or their Affiliates for the actual cost to the General Partners or their Affiliates (or pay directly), the cost of goods and materials used for or by the Partnership and obtained from entities unaffiliated with the General Partners or their Affiliates. The Partnership shall also pay or reimburse the General Partners or their Affiliates for the cost of administrative services necessary to the prudent operation of the Partnership, provided that such reimbursement will be at the lower of (A) the actual cost to the General Partners or their Affiliates of providing such services, or (B) 90% of the amount the Partnership would be required to pay to non affiliated persons rendering similar services in the same or comparable geographical location. The cost of administrative services as used in this subsection shall mean the pro rata cost of personnel, including an allocation of overhead directly attributable to such personnel, based on the amount of time such personnel spent on such services, or oth er method of allocation acceptable to the program's independent certified public accountant. 
10.16 Non-reimbursable Expenses.

 SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT AND POWER OF ATTORNEY 
 REDWOOD MORTGAGE INVESTORS VIII 
 A CALIFORNIA LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 
The undersigned hereby applies to become a limited partner in REDWOOD MORTGAGE INVESTORS VIII, a California limited partnership (the "partnership"), and subscribes to purchase the number of units specified herein in accordance with the terms and conditions of the limited partnership agreement attached as Exhibit A to the prospectus dated July 28, 2005. 
1. Representations and Warranties. The undersigned represents and warrants to the partnership and its general partners as follows: 
(a) I have received, read and understand the prospectus dated July 28, 2005, and in making this investment I am relying only on the information provided therein. I have not relied  on any statements or representations inconsistent with those contained in the prospectus. 
(b) I, or the fiduciary account for which I am purchasing, meet the applicable suitability standards and financial requirements set forth in the prospectus under "INVESTOR SUITABIL ITY STANDARDS" as they pertain to the state of my primary residence and domicile. 
(c) I am aware that this subscription may be rejected in whole or in part by the general partners in their sole and absolute discretion; that my investment, if accepted, is subject to certain risks described in part in "RISK FACTORS" set forth in the prospectus; and that there will be no public market for units, and accordingly, it may not be possible for me  to readily liquidate my investment in the partnership. 
(d) I have been informed by the participating broker-dealer firm specified herein, if any, of all pertinent facts relating to the lack of liquidity or marketability of this investment. I understand that units may not be sold or otherwise disposed of without the prior written consent of the general partners, which consent may be granted or withheld in their sole discretion, that any transfer is subject to numerous other restrictions described in the prospectus and in the limited partnership agreement, and that if I am a resident of California or if the transfer occurs in California, any such transfer is also subject to the prior written consent of the California Commissioner of Corporations. I have liquid assets sufficient to assure myself that such purchase will cause me no undue financial difficulties and that I can provide for my current needs and possible personal contingencies, or if I am the trustee of a retirement trust, that the limited liquidity of the units will not cause difficulty in meeting the trust's obligations to make distributions to plan particip ants in a timely manner. 
(e) I am of the age of majority (as established in the state in which I am domiciled) if I am an individual, and in any event, I have full power, capacity, and authority to enter into a contractual relationship with the partnership. If acting in a representative or fiduciary capacity for a corporation, partnership or trust, or as a custodian or agent for any person or entity, I have full power or authority to enter into this subscription agreement in such capacity and on behalf of such corporation, partnership, trust, person or entity . 
(f) By virtue of my own investment acumen and experience or financial advice from my independent advisors (other than a person receiving commissions by reason of my purchase of uni ts), I am capable of evaluating the risks and merits of an investment in the partnership. 
(g) I am buying the units solely for my own account, or for the account of a member or members of my immediate family or in a fiduciary capacity for the account of another person o r entity and not as an agent for another. 
(h) I acknowledge and agree that counsel representing the partnership, the general partners and their affiliates does not represent me and shall not be deemed under the applicable codes of professional responsibility to have represented or to be representing me or any of the limited partners in any respect. 
(i) If I am buying the units in a fiduciary capacity or as a custodian for the account of another person or entity, I have been directed by that person or entity to purchase the unit(s), and such person or entity is aware of my purchase of units on their behalf, and consents thereto and is aware of the merits and risks involved in the investment in the partn ership. 
BY MAKING THESE REPRESENTATIONS, THE SUBSCRIBER HAS NOT WAIVED ANY RIGHT OF ACTION AVAILABLE UNDER APPLICABLE FEDERAL OR STATE SECURITIES LAWS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE SECU RITIES ACT OF 1933. 
   
 27 
 
 
2. Power of Attorney. The undersigned hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the general partners, and each of them, either one acting alone, as his true and lawful attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority for him, and in his name, place and stead, to execute, acknowledge, publish and file: 
(a) The limited partnership agreement and any amendments thereto or cancellations thereof required under the laws of the State of California; 
(b) Any other instruments, and documents as may be required by, or may be appropriate under, the laws of any state or other jurisdiction in which the partnership is doing or intend s to do business; and 
(c) Any documents which may be required to effect the continuation of the partnership, the admission of an additional or substituted limited partner, or the dissolution and termina tion of the partnership. 
The power of attorney granted above is a special power of attorney coupled with an interest, is irrevocable, and shall survive the death or incapacity of the undersigned or, if the undersigned is a corporation, partnership, trust or association, the dissolution or termination thereof. The power of attorney shall also survive the delivery of an assignment of units by a limited partner; provided, that where the assignee thereof has been approved by the general partners for admission to the partnership as a substituted limited partner, such power of attorney shall survive the delivery of such assignment for the sole purpose of enabling the general partners to execute, acknowledge, file and record any instrument ne cessary to effect such substitution. 
3. Acceptance. This subscription agreement will be accepted or rejected by a general partner within thirty (30) days of its receipt by the partnership. The general partners also reserve the right to revoke its acceptance within such thirty (30) day period. Upon acceptance, this subscription will become irrevocable, and will obligate the undersigned to purchase the number of units specified herein, for the purchase price of $1 per unit. The general partners will return a countersigned copy of this subscription agreement to accepted sub scribers, which copy (together with my canceled check) will be evidence of my purchase of units. 
4. Payment of Subscription Price. The full purchase price for units is $1 per unit, payable in cash concurrently with delivery of this subscription agreement. I understand that my subscription funds will be held by the general partners until my funds are needed by the partnership to fund a mortgage investment or for other proper partnership purposes, and only then will I actually be admitted to the partnership. In the interim, my subscription funds will earn interest at passbook savings accounts rates. If I elect to receive monthly, quarterly or annual cash distributions, then such interest will be returned to me after I am admitted to the partnership. If I elect to allow my share of partnership income to be paid in the form of additional units that will be reinvested by the partnership, then such interest will be invested in the partnership in which case I understand that the number of units I initially subscribed for will be increased accordingly. If I initially elect to receive additional units and reinvest my share of partnership income, I may after three (3) years change my election and receive monthly, quarterly or annual cash distributions. I understand that if I initially elect to receive monthly, quarterly or annual cash distributions, my election to receive cash distributions is irrevocable. However, I understand that I may change whether I receive such distributions on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis.

 SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT AND POWER OF ATTORNEY 
 REDWOOD MORTGAGE INVESTORS VIII, 
 A California Limited Partnership 
 UNSOLICITED SALES 
The undersigned hereby applies to become a limited partner in REDWOOD MORTGAGE INVESTORS VIII, a California limited partnership (the "partnership"), and subscribes to purchase the number of units specified herein in accordance with the terms and conditions of the limited partnership agreement attached as Exhibit A to the prospectus dated July 28, 2005. 
1. Representations and Warranties. The undersigned represents and warrants to the partnership and its general partners as follows: 
(a) I have received, read and understand the prospectus dated July 28, 2005, and in making this investment I am relying only on the information provided therein. I have not relied  on any statements or representations inconsistent with those contained in the prospectus. 
(b) I, or the fiduciary account for which I am purchasing, meet the applicable suitability standards and financial requirements set forth in the prospectus under "INVESTOR SUITABIL ITY STANDARDS" as they pertain to the state of my primary residence and domicile. 
(c) I am aware that this subscription may be rejected in whole or in part by the general partners in their sole and absolute discretion; that my investment, if accepted, is subject to certain risks described in part in "RISK FACTORS" set forth in the prospectus; and that there will be no public market for units, and accordingly, it may not be possible for me  to readily liquidate my investment in the partnership. 
(d) I have been informed by the participating broker-dealer firm specified herein, if any, of all pertinent facts relating to the lack of liquidity or marketability of this investment. I understand that units may not be sold or otherwise disposed of without the prior written consent of the general partners, which consent may be granted or withheld in their sole discretion, that any transfer is subject to numerous other restrictions described in the prospectus and in the limited partnership agreement, and that if I am a resident of California or if the transfer occurs in California, any such transfer is also subject to the prior written consent of the California Commissioner of Corporations. I have liquid assets sufficient to assure myself that such purchase will cause me no undue financial difficulties and that I can provide for my current needs and possible personal contingencies, or if I am the trustee of a retirement trust, that the limited liquidity of the units will not cause difficulty in meeting the trust's obligations to make distributions to plan particip ants in a timely manner. 
(e) I am of the age of majority (as established in the state in which I am domiciled) if I am an individual, and in any event, I have full power, capacity, and authority to enter into a contractual relationship with the partnership. If acting in a representative or fiduciary capacity for a corporation, partnership or trust, or as a custodian or agent for any person or entity, I have full power or authority to enter into this subscription agreement in such capacity and on behalf of such corporation, partnership, trust, person or entity . 
(f) By virtue of my own investment acumen and experience or financial advice from my independent advisors (other than a person receiving commissions by reason of my purchase of uni ts), I am capable of evaluating the risks and merits of an investment in the partnership. 
(g) I am buying the units solely for my own account, or for the account of a member or members of my immediate family or in a fiduciary capacity for the account of another person o r entity and not as an agent for another. 
(h) I acknowledge and agree that counsel representing the partnership, the general partners and their affiliates does not represent me and shall not be deemed under the applicable codes of professional responsibility to have represented or to be representing me or any of the limited partners in any respect. 
(i) If I am buying the units in a fiduciary capacity or as a custodian for the account of another person or entity, I have been directed by that person or entity to purchase the unit(s), and such person or entity is aware of my purchase of units on their behalf, and consents thereto and is aware of the merits and risks involved in the investment in the partn ership. 
   
 35 
 
 
BY MAKING THESE REPRESENTATIONS, THE SUBSCRIBER HAS NOT WAIVED ANY RIGHT OF ACTION AVAILABLE UNDER APPLICABLE FEDERAL OR STATE SECURITIES LAWS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE SECU RITIES ACT OF 1933. 
2. Power of Attorney. The undersigned hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the general partners, and each of them, either one acting alone, as his true and lawful attorney-in-fact, with full power and authority for him, and in his name, place and stead, to execute, acknowledge, publish and file: 
(a) The limited partnership agreement and any amendments thereto or cancellations thereof required under the laws of the State of California; 
(b) Any other instruments, and documents as may be required by, or may be appropriate under, the laws of any state or other jurisdiction in which the partnership is doing or intend s to do business; and 
(c) Any documents which may be required to effect the continuation of the partnership, the admission of an additional or substituted limited partner, or the dissolution and termina tion of the partnership. 
The power of attorney granted above is a special power of attorney coupled with an interest, is irrevocable, and shall survive the death or incapacity of the undersigned or, if the undersigned is a corporation, partnership, trust or association, the dissolution or termination thereof. The power of attorney shall also survive the delivery of an assignment of units by a limited partner; provided, that where the assignee thereof has been approved by the general partners for admission to the partnership as a substituted limited partner, such power of attorney shall survive the delivery of such assignment for the sole purpose of enabling the general partners to execute, acknowledge, file and record any instrument ne cessary to effect such substitution. 
3. Acceptance. This subscription agreement will be accepted or rejected by a general partner within thirty (30) days of its receipt by the partnership. The general partners also reserve the right to revoke its acceptance within such thirty (30) day period. Upon acceptance, this subscription will become irrevocable, and will obligate the undersigned to purchase the number of units specified herein, for the purchase price of $1 per unit. The general partners will return a countersigned copy of this subscription agreement to accepted sub scribers, which copy (together with my canceled check) will be evidence of my purchase of units. 
4. Payment of Subscription Price. The full purchase price for units is $1 per unit, payable in cash concurrently with delivery of this subscription agreement. I understand that my subscription funds will be held by the general partners until my funds are needed by the partnership to fund a mortgage investment or for other proper partnership purposes, and only then will I actually be admitted to the partnership. In the interim, my subscription funds will earn interest at passbook savings accounts rates. If I elect to receive monthly, quarterly or annual cash distributions, then such interest will be returned to me after I am admitted to the partnership. If I elect to allow my share of partnership income to be paid in the form of additional units that will be reinvested by the partnership, then such interest will be invested in the partnership in which case I understand that the number of units I initially subscribed for will be increased accordingly. If I initially elect to receive additional units and reinvest my share of partnership income, I may after three (3) years change my election and receive monthly, quarterly or annual cash distributions. I understand that if I initially elect to receive monthly, quarterly or annual cash distributions, my election to receive cash distributions is irrevocable. However, I understand that I may change whether I receive such distributions on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. 
5. THE UNDERSIGNED AGREES TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD REDWOOD MORTGAGE INVESTORS VIII, A CALIFORNIA LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, AND ITS GENERAL PARTNERS AND OTHER AGENTS AND EMPLOYEES HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, LIABILITIES, AND DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL ATTORNEYS' FEES WHICH SHALL BE PAID AS INCURRED) WHICH ANY OF THEM MAY INCUR, IN ANY MANNER OR TO ANY PERSON, BY REASON OF THE FALSITY, INCOMPLETENESS OR MISREPRESENTATION OF ANY INFORMATION FURNISHED BY THE UNDERSIGNED HEREIN OR IN ANY DOCUMENT SUBMITT ED HEREWITH. 
6. Signature. The undersigned represents that: (a) I have read the foregoing and that all the information provided by me is accurate and complete; and (b) I will notify the general partners immediately of any material adverse change in any of the information set forth herein which occurs prior to the acceptance of my subscription.

The undersigned acknowledges that all periodic cash distributions by the partnership are non-cumulative.
