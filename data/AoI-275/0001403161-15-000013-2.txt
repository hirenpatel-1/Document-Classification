Any nomination made in accordance with this   Section 2.17  that results in a Stockholder Nominee being included in the Corporation's proxy materials in accordance with the terms of this   Section 2.17   shall be deemed made in accordance with   Section 2.3(a) ,   Section 2.3(d)   and   Section 2.5(a)   of these By-Laws.

In the event that the number of Stockholder Nomi nees submitted by Eligible Stockholders pursuant to this   Section 2.17  exceeds the Permitted Number, the Corporation shall determine which Stockholder Nominees shall be included in the Corporation's proxy materials in accordance with the following provisions: each Eligible Stockholder will select one Stockholder Nominee for inclusion in the Corporation's proxy materials until the Permitted Number is reached, going in order of the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of the Corporation each Eligible Stockholder disclosed as Owned in its respective Stockholder Notice submitted to the Corporation. If the Permitted Number is not reached after each Eligible Stockholder has selected one Stockholder Nominee, this selection process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each time, until the Permitted Number is reached. Following such determination, if any Stockholder Nominee who satisfies the eligibility requirements in this   Section 2.17  thereafter is nominated by the Board, thereafter is not included in the Corporation's proxy materials or thereafter is not submitted for director election for any reason (including  the Eligible Stockholder's or Stockholder Nominee's failure to comply with this   Section 2.17), no other nominee or nominees shall be included in the Corporation's proxy materials or otherwise submitted for director election in substitution thereof. 
 (l)     Any Stockholder Nominee who is included in the Corporation's proxy materials for a particular annual meeting of stockholders but either (i) withdraws from or becomes ineligible or unavailable for election at the annual meeting for any reason, including for the failure to comply with any provision of these By-Laws ( provided  that in no event shall any such withdrawal, ineligibility or unavailability commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a Stockholder Notice) or (ii) does not receive a number of votes cast in favor of his or her election at least equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote in the election of directors, will be ineligible to be a Stockholder Nominee pursuant to this   Section 2.17   for the next two annual meetings. 
 
 
      
 
 
 
 (m)     The Board (and any other person or body authorized by the Board) shall have the power and authority to interpret this   Section 2.17   and to make any and all determinations necessary or advisable to apply this   Section 2.17  to any persons, facts or circumstances, including the power to determine (i) whether one or more stockholders or beneficial owners qualifies as an Eligible Stockholder, (ii) whethe r a Stockholder Notice complies with this   Section 2.17 , (iii) whether a Stockholder Nominee satisfies the qualifications and requirements in this   Section 2.17 , and (iv) whether any and all requirements of this   Section 2.17  have been satisfied.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this   Section 2.17, unless otherwise required by law or otherwise determined by the chairperson of the meeting or the Board, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder as d efined in   Section 2.5(a) )  does not appear at the annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present its Stockholder Nominee or Stockholder Nominees, such nomination or nominations shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of the election of the Stockholder Nominee or Stockholder Nominees may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes of this   Section 2.17(m), a "qualified representative" of a stockholder shall mean a person who is a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of such stockholder or authorized by a writing executed by such stockholder (or a reliable reproduction or electronic transmission in writing) delivered to the Corporation prior to the making of a nomination at a meeting by such stockholder stating that such person is authorized to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders.
