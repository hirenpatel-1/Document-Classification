(a)    All notices of meetings with stockholders shall be in writing and shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with section 2.5 of these bylaws not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting.

(b)    Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the corporation shall also be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (i) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent, and (ii) such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to recognize such revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. 
 
 2.5     Manner of Giving Notice; Affidavit of Notice 
 
(a)    Written notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his, her or its address as it appears on the records of the corporation. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary 
 
 
 
or of the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. 
 
(b)    Notice given pursuant to section 2.4 shall be deemed given: (i) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (iii) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of such posting and the giving of such separate notice; and (iv) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder. An affidavit of the secretary, an assistant secretary or the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. 
 
(c)    Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the corporation shall be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom such notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any stockholder who fails to object in writing to the corporation, within 60 days of having been given written notice by the corporation of its intention to send the single notice permitted under this subsection 2.5(c), shall be deemed to have consented to receiving such single written notice. This subsection 2.5(c) shall not apply to any notice given to stockholders under sections 164 (notice of sale of shares of stockholder who failed to pay an installment or call on stock not fully paid), 296 (notice of disputed claims relating to insolvent corporations), 311 (notice of meeting of stockholders to revoke dissolution of corporation), 312 (notice of meeting of stockholders of corporation whose certificate of incorporation has been renewed or revived) and 324 (notice when stock has been attached as required for sale upon execut ion process) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. 
 
 2.6     Quorum 
 
The holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. 
 
 2.7     Adjourned Meeting; Notice 
 
 
 
 
The chairman has the power to adjourn a stockholder meeting. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, unless these bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof, and the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. 
 
 2.8     Voting; Action at Meeting 
 
The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 2.11 of these bylaws, subject to the provisions of sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting  agreements). 
 
Except as otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockh older. 
 
When a quorum is present at any meeting of stockholders, the vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares of stock present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of applicable law, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question. 
 
 2.9     Waiver of Notice 
 
Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver or any waiver by electronic transmission of notice unless so required  by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws. 
 
 2.10 
 
 Stockholder Action by Written Consent Without a Meeting 
 
 
Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required by this chapter to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of a corporation, or  any action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken 
 
 
 
without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the effectiveness of the registration of any class of stock of the corporation effective upon the corporation's initial public offering of stock under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, no action shall be taken by the stockholders of the corporation except at an annual or special meeting of stockholders called in accor dance with these bylaws and no action shall be taken by the stockholders by written consent. 
 
A telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder, proxyholder, or other person or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated for the purposes of this section, provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the corporation can determine (a) that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was transmitted by the stockholder, proxyholder, or other authorized person or persons, and (b) the date on which such stockholder, proxyholder or other authorized person or persons transmitted such telegram, cablegram or electronic transmission. The date on which such telegram, cablegram or electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which such consent was signed. No consent given by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until such consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall have been delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in this State, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the corporation's registered office shall be made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on delivery, consents given by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission may be otherwise delivered to the principal place of business of the corporation or to an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded if, to the extent and in the manner provided by resolution of the board of directors of the corporation. Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all purposes for which the original writing could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing. 
 
Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing. If the action that is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the General Corporation Law of Delaware if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written notice and written consent have been given as provided in Section 228 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. 
 
 
 
 
 2.11     Record Date for Stockholder Notice; Voting; Giving Consents 
 
In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date that shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action. 
 
 If the board of directors does not so fix a record date:

(b)    the record date for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is  necessary, shall be the day on which the first written consent is expressed; and

 2.12     Proxies 
 
Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by a written proxy, signed by the stockholder and filed with the secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable  shall be governed by the provisions of section 212(e) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. 
 
 2.13     List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote 
 
 
 
 
The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of a corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.

Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting: (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (b) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the corporation. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be p rovided with the notice of the meeting.

 VI. INDEMNITY 
 
 6.1     Indemnification of Directors and Officers 
 
The corporation shall, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, indemnify each of its directors and officers against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding, arising by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the corporation. For purposes of this section 6.1, a director or officer of the corporation includes any person (a) who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, (b) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, manager, member, partner, trustee, or other agent of another corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (c) who was a director or officer 
 
 
 
of a corporation that was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation. Such indemnification shall be a contract right and shall include the right to receive payment of any expenses incurred by the indemnitee in connection with any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, consistent with the provisions of applicable law as then in effect. The right of indemnification provided in this section 6.1 shall not be exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may otherwise be entitled, and the provisions of this section 6.1 shall inure to the benefit of the heirs and legal representatives of any person entitled to indemnity under this section 6.1 and shall be applicable to proceedings commenced or continuing after the adoption of this section 6.1, whether arising from acts or omissions occurring before or after such adoption. In furtherance, but not in limitation of the foregoing provisions, the following procedures, presumptions and remedies shall apply with respect to  advancement of expenses and the right to indemnification under this section 6.1. 
 
 (a)     Advancement of Expenses. All reasonable expenses incurred by or on behalf of the indemnitee in connection with any proceeding shall be advanced to the indemnitee by the corporation within 30 days after the receipt by the corporation of a statement or statements from the indemnitee requesting such advance or advances from time to time, whether prior to or after final disposition of such proceeding, unless, prior to the expiration of such 30-day period, the board of directors shall unanimously (except for the vote, if applicable, of the indemnitee) determine that the indemnitee has no reasonable likelihood of being entitled to indemnification pursuant to this section 6.1. Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the expenses incurred by the indemnitee and, if required by law at the time of such advance, shall include or be accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of the indemnitee to repay the amounts advanced if it should ultimately be determined that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against such expenses pursuant to this section 6.1. 
 
 (b)     Procedure for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification . 
 
(i)    To obtain indemnification under this section 6.1, an indemnitee shall submit to the Secretary of the corporation a written request, including such documentation and information as is reasonably available to the indemnitee and reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification (the "Supporting Documentation"). The determination of the indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification shall be made not later than 60 days after receipt by the corporation of the written request for indemnification together with the Supporting Documentation. The Secretary of the corporation shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the board of directors in writing that the indemnitee has requested indemnification, whereupon the corporation shall provide such indemnification, including without limitation advancement of e xpenses, so long as the indemnitee is legally entitled thereto in accordance with applicable law. 
 
(ii)    The indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification under this section 6.1 shall be determined in one of the following ways: (A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors (as hereinafter defined), even though less than a quorum of the board of directors; (B) by a committee of such Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum of the boa rd of 
 
 
 
directors; (C) by a written opinion of Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined) if (x) a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred and the indemnitee so requests or (y) a quorum of the board of directors consisting of Disinterested Directors is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a majority of such Disinterested Directors so directs; (D) by the stockholders of the corporation (but only if a majority of the Disinterested Directors, if they constitute a quorum of the board of directors, presents the issue of entitlement to indemnification to the stockholders for their determination); or (E) as provided in paragraph (c) below. 
 
(iii)    In the event the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to paragraph (b)(ii) above, a majority of the Disinterested Directors shall select the Independent Counsel, but only an Independent Counsel to which the indemnitee does not reasonably object; provided, however, that if a Change of Control shall have occurred, the indemnitee shall select such Independent Counsel, but only an Independent Counsel to which the board of directors does not reasonably object. 
 
(iv)    The only basis upon which a finding that indemnification may not be made is that such indemnification is prohibited by law. 
 
 (c)     Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this section 6.1, if a Change of Control shall have occurred, the indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this section 6.1 upon submission of a request for Indemnification together with the Supporting Documentation in accordance with paragraph (b)(i), and thereafter the corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in reaching a contrary determination. In any event, if the person or persons empowered under paragraph (b)(ii) above to determine entitlement to indemnification shall not have been appointed or shall not have made a determination within 60 days after receipt by the corporation of the request therefor together with the Supporting Documentation, the indemnitee shall be deemed to be entitled to indemnification and the indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification unless (A) the indemnitee misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the request for indemnification or in the Supporting Documentation or (B) such indemnification is prohibited by law. The termination of any proceeding described in this section 6.1, or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a ple a of   nolo contendere  or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, adversely affect the right of the indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that the indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner that the indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that the indemnitee  had reasonable cause to believe that the indemnitee's conduct was unlawful. 
 
 (d)     Remedies of Indemnitee . 
 
(i)    In the event that a determination is made pursuant to paragraph (b)(ii) that the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this section 6.1: (A) the indemnitee shall be entitled to seek an adjudication of his or her entitlement to such indemnification either, at the indemnitee's sole option, in (x) an appropriate court of the State of Delawa re or any other court of competent jurisdiction, or (y) an arbitration to be conducted by a 
 
 
 
single arbitrator pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association; (B) any such judicial proceeding or arbitration shall be   de novo  and the indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of such adverse determination; and (C) in any such judicial proceeding or arbitration the corporation shall have the burden of  proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification under this section 6.1. 
 
(ii)    If a determination shall have been made or is deemed to have been made, pursuant to paragraph (b)(ii) or (iii), that the indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the corporation shall be obligated to pay the amounts constituting such indemnification within five days after such determination has been made or is deemed to have been made and shall be conclusively bound by such determination unless (A) the indemnitee misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact in making the request for indemnification or in the Supporting Documentation, or (B) such indemnification is prohibited by law. In the event that: (X) advancement of expenses is not timely made pursuant to paragraph (a); or (Y) payment of indemnification is not made within five days after a determination of entitlement to indemnification has been made or deemed to have been made pursuant to paragraph (b)(ii) or (iii), the indemnitee shall be entitled to seek judicial enforcement of the corporation's obligation to pay to the indemnitee such advancement of expenses or indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the corporation may bring an action, in an appropriate court in the State of Delaware or any other court of competent jurisdiction, contesting the right of the indemnitee to receive indemnification hereunder due to the occurrence of an event described in subclause (A) or (B) of this clause (ii) (a "Disqualifying Event"); provided, however, that in any such action the corporation shall have the burden of proving the occurrence of such Disqualifying Event. 
 
(iii)    The corporation shall be precluded from asserting in any judicial proceedings or arbitration commenced pursuant to this paragraph (d) that the procedures and presumptions of this section 6.1 are not valid, binding and enforceable and shall stipulate in any such court or before any such arbitrator that the corporation is bound by all the provisions o f this section 6.1. 
 
(iv)    In the event that the indemnitee, pursuant to this paragraph (d), seeks a judicial adjudication of or an award in arbitration to enforce his or her rights under, or to recover damages for breach of, this section 6.1, the indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from the corporation, and shall be indemnified by the corporation against, any expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnitee if the indemnitee prevails in such judicial adjudication or arbitration. If it shall be determined in such judicial adjudication or arbitration that the indemnitee is entitled to receive part but not all of the indemnification or advancement of expenses sought, the expenses incurred by the indemnitee in connect ion with such judicial adjudication shall be prorated accordingly. 
 
 (e)     Definitions . For purposes of this section 6.1: 
 
(i)    "Change in Control" means a change in control of the corporation of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A  promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 
 
 
 
"Exchange Act"), whether or not the corporation is then subject to such reporting requirement; provided that, without limitation, such a change in control shall be deemed to have occurred if (i) any "person" (as such term is used in sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule l3dâ€‘3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the corporation representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the corporation's then outstanding securities without the prior approval of at least a majority of the members of the board of directors in office immediately prior to such acquisition; (ii) the corporation is a party to a merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other reorganization, or a proxy contest, as a consequence of which members of the board of directors in office immediately prior to such transaction or event constitute less than a majority of the board of directors thereafter; or (iii) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the board of directors (including for this purpose any new director whose election or nomination for election by the corporation's stockholders was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then still in office who were directors at the beginning of such period) cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the board of  directors. 
 
(ii)    "Disinterested Director" means a director of the corporation who is not a party to the proceeding in respect of which indemnification is sought by the indemnitee.
