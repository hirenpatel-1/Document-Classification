 AMENDED AND RESTATED CONSTRUCTION LOAN NOTE

 principal amount of $2,000,000.00) 
   
 
 Date of Note: 
 
 
 
 March 1, 2017 
 
 
 
     Principal Amount: $2,560,000.00     Maturity Date:   March 1, 2027 
   
 Interest Rate: 
An interest rate equal at all times to Two and One Quarter percent (2.25%) per annum in excess of the rate of interest per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100 of 1%) of the one (1) month LIBOR (as hereinafter defined). The Lender shall not be required to notify Borrower of adjustments in said interest rate. 
   
"LIBOR" (i.e., the London Interbank Offered Rate) means the rate of interest in U.S. Dollars (rounded upwards, at the Lender's option, to the next 1/8th of one percent) equal to the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration Ltd. ("ICE, "or the successor thereto if ICE is no longer making a London Interbank Offered Rate available) ("ICE LIBOR") rate for the equivalent Interest Period as published by Bloomberg (or such other commercially available source providing quotations of ICE LIBOR as designated by Lender from time to time) at approximately 11:00 A.M. (London time) two (2) London Business Days prior to the Reset Date; provided however, if more than one ICE LIBOR is specified, the applicable rate shall be the arithmetic mean of all such rates. If, for any reason, such rate is not available, the term LIBOR Rate shall mean, for the LIBOR Interest Period applicable thereto, the rate of interest per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100 of 1%) determined by Lender to be the average rates per annum at which deposits in dollars are offered for such LIBOR Interest Period to major banks in the London Interbank market in London, England at approximately 11:00 A.M. (London time) two (2) Business Days prior to the Reset Date. The Interest Rate shall be computed on an actual/360 day basis (i.e., interest for each day during which the Principal Amount, or any part thereof, is outstanding shall be  computed at the Interest Rate, divided by 360). 
       
Notwithstanding the foregoing, LIBOR Rate loans shall be deemed to constitute Eurocurrency liabilities and as such shall be deemed subject to reserve requirements without benefits of credits for proration, exceptions or offsets that may be available from time to time to Lender. The LIBOR Rate shall be adjusted automatically on and as of the effective date of any change in the LIBOR Reserve Percentage or the LIBOR Interest Period for each LIBOR Rate loan comprising part of the same borrowing (including conversions, extensions and renew als), to a per annum interest rate determined pursuant to the following formula: 
   
 Adjusted LIBOR Rate =  LIBOR Rate                              
 1 - LIBOR Reserve Percentage 
   
For purposes of this calculation LIBOR Reserve Percentage is defined as, for any day, that percentage (expressed as a decimal) which is in effect from time to time under Regulation D, as such regulation may be amended from time to time or any successor regulation, as the maximum reserve requirement (including, without limitation, any basic, supplemental, emergency, special, or marginal reserves) applicable with respect to Eurocurrency liabilities as that term is defined in Regulation D (or against any other category of liabilities that includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate of LIBOR Rate loans is determined), whether or not Lender has any Eurocurrency liabilities subject to such reserve requi rement at that time.

 LIBOR Interest Period:Initially, the first (1st) LIBOR Interest Period hereunder shall be the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on (and including) March 31, 2017.  Thereafter, each LIBOR Interest Period shall commence on the first (1st) day of the calendar month immediately following the previous LIBOR Interest Period (the " Reset Date") and shall end on the last day of such month; provided however, (i) no LIBOR Interest Period shall extend beyond the Maturity Date of the Loan, and (ii) any LIBOR Interest Period that begins on the last Business Day of a calendar month (or on a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar  month at the end of such LIBOR Interest Period) shall end on the last Business Day of the relevant calendar month at the end of such LIBOR Interest Period.       Construction Loan Agreement:

Box 9540, Portland, Maine, 04112, or at such other place as the holder hereof may from time to time designate in writing, in immediately available federal funds, the Principal Amount or so much thereof as shall be advanced by Lender to Borrower pursuant to the Construction Loan Agreement and then remaining unpaid, together with interest on the outstanding Principal Amount from time to time at the Interest Rate. Interest only shall be due and payable monthly, commencing April 1, 2017 and on the same day of each successive month until March 1, 2018 (the " Payment Change Date "). 
   
Beginning with the payment next due after the Payment Change Date, principal payments shall be due and payable pursuant to a schedule of principal payments based on a twenty year e ven amortization to be later attached to this Note as  Schedule A to be then provided by the Lender, plus accrued interest, in equal monthly installments, followed by a final installment of all unpaid principal and interest due and payable on th e Maturity Date. Borrower may elect an interest rate swap for all or any portion of the loan. 
   
For so long as the Interest Rate in effect is a variable rate of interest, the loan evidenced hereby may be prepaid in part or in full at any time without premium. However, upon Borrower's execution of any ISDA interest rate swap or other hedging agreement in connection with this Construction Loan Note synthetically converting the Interest Rate to an indicative fixed rate, any prepayment shall be subject to the terms of such a swap or hedge agreement, including any provisions relating to termination fees. 
   
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower may elect to reduce the "interest only" time period set forth herein and begin amortizing the Loan before the Payment Change Date, provided,  however, that the total Loan amount has been fully advanced to the Borrower.

Borrower agrees to maintain sufficient funds in the Deposit Account to satisfy the payment due Lender under the Note on the next succeeding Charge Date during the term of this Note. If sufficient funds are not available in the Deposit Account on any Charge Date to pay the amounts then due and payable under this Note, Lender, in its sole discretion, is authorized to: (a) charge the Deposit Account for such lesser amount as shall then be available; and/or (b) charge the Deposit Account on such later date or dates after the applicable Charge Date that funds shall be available in the Deposit Account to satisfy the payment then due (or balance of such payment then due). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall only be entitled to receive credit in respect of any payments of principal and interest due under the Note for funds actually received by Lender as a result of any such charges to the Deposit Account. Borrower shall be liable to Lender for any late fees or interest at the Default Rate on any payments not made on a timely basis by Borrower because of insufficient funds in the Deposit Account on any Charge Date. In the event the Deposit Account continues to contain insufficient funds to fully satisfy the payments due Lender under the Note, Borrower shall be responsible for making all such payments from another source and in no event shall the obligations of Borrower under the Note be affected or diminished as a result of any shortages in the Deposit Account, it being understood and agreed that Borrower shall at all times remain liable for payment in full of all indebtedness under the Note. 
   
Lender may, at Lender's sole discretion, discontinue charging the Deposit Account at any time on not less than ten (10) days' written notice to the Borrower, in which event, Borrower shall thereafter be responsible for making all payments hereunder to Lender at the address set forth in Lender's notice or if no such address is given, then to Lender at P.O.

DEFAULT / POST JUDGMENT INTEREST RATE. The Lender shall have the right to charge interest on the unpaid principal balance hereof at an interest rate of four percent (4.0%) per annu m in excess of the Interest Rate otherwise payable as provided herein (the " Default Rate") for any period during which the Borrower has failed to make a required payment hereunder within ten (10) days of the due date therefor, or shall be in default under any material provision hereof or there shall be a default under any other document guarantying, governing or securing this Note. The Default Rate shall apply following entry of any judgment he reon notwithstanding any otherwise applicable statutory rate. 
   
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Note, if Lender shall reasonably determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that, (i) by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, reasonable and adequate means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBOR Rate, or (ii) it is unlawful for Lender to make or maintain the loan evidenced by the Note as a LIBOR Rate based loan as contemplated by this Note, or to obtain in the interbank Eurodollar market the funds with which to make such LIBOR Rate based loans, Lender shall give prompt written notice thereof to Borrower and after the giving of such notice, until any such notice has been withdrawn by Lender, the Principal Amount shall bear interest at another rate then designated by the Lender, in its sole discretion, for general commercial loan reference purposes. 
   
If the adoption of or any change in any applicable law or regulation or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other governmental authority made subsequent to the date hereof, shall (a) subject Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to any LIBOR Rate based loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments to Lender in respect thereof (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of Lender); (b) impose, modify, or hold applicable, any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in, or for the account of, advances, loans, or other extension of credit (including participations therein) by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of Lender which is not otherwise included in the determination of the Adjusted LIBOR Rate hereunder; or (c) shall impose on such Lender any other condition; and the result of any of the foregoing is to materially increase the cost to Lender of making or maintaining the loan evidenced by this Note as a LIBOR Rate based loan, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder, then, in any such case, Borrower shall promptly pay Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate Lender for such additional costs or reduced amount receivable which Lender reasonably deems to be material as determined by Lender, with respect to this Note. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this paragraph submitted by Lender to Borrower shall be presumptive evidence of such amounts owing. Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts to avoid, or to minimize, any amounts which might otherwise be payable pursuant to this paragraph provided however, that such efforts shall not cause the imposition on Lender of any additional costs or legal regulatory burdens deeme d by Lender in good faith to be material.
