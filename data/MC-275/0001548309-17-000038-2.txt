For clarity, the parties note the term "HTS Invoice Price" in the Agreement includes amounts that were previously included in Seller's invoice costs for HTS Products but which amounts Seller agrees with the vendor of the HTS Products to pay separately to the vendor (" Added Costs"). Buyer shall pay its share of all Added Costs; regardless of when they are incurred. Seller has provided, and shall provide, Buyer prompt notice of all Added Costs and changes to Added Costs after they are agreed to by Seller and its vendors, after which notice Buyer may as soon as reasonably practicable revise its forecasts for HTS Products for which Seller has not yet entered a purchase order into its purchase order system and that are affected by the noticed Added Costs or changes thereto.

Buyer is also aware that the failure to comply with a Vendor's MAP or UPP could result in the Vendor's imposition of financial penalties on Seller and the Vendor's refusal to sell one or more HTS Products to Seller, which ultimately could result in Seller's inability to sell one or more HTS Products to Buyer in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Buyer is also aware that Seller could  seek to implement its own MAP and UPP with respect to HTS Products. 
 
 HTS Product Quality, Availability, and Packaging .

Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to include in HTS Products available to Buyer all new products and product innovations that Seller purchases from Vendors so that Buyer will have the opportunity to offer HTS Products that are as compelling to Buyer's end-user consumers as Seller's comparable product offerings in its full line stores. Seller will obtain Buyer's prior written approval for all initial KCD-Unique Product packaging specifications and graphic designs and for all changes to them.

A " Location-Specific   Product" is an HTS Product, other than a Customer-Specific Product and a Non-Retail Product, that Seller sells to resellers (including Seller's Retail Businesses) and as to which Seller requires all of the resellers to resell only at "bricks and mortar" physical locations or by Digital Methods.

Subject to the foregoing sentence, Seller will (x) not refuse to sell to Buyer any Buyer-Unique Product that is available for purchase on commercially reasonable terms from a Vendor, and (y) promptly notify Buyer if a Vendor discontinues a Buyer -Unique Product .  During Seller's 2016 fiscal year, Seller has agreed to hold up to $13 million of Buyer-Unique Products inventory based upon a forecast of needs that Buyer has provided.

Seller may, at any time, elect to begin selling any or all Buyer-Unique Product(s) at Seller's FLS Stores or on Sears.com and Buyer shall not object to, or take any action to prevent, Seller from selling Buyer-Unique Products at Seller's FLS Stores. If Seller intends to begin selling Buyer-Unique Products at Seller's FLS Stores (vs Sears.com), Seller shall forecast its needs to its Vendors and Seller will not floor Buyer-Unique Products until Seller has sufficient supply so as to not interfere with Buyer's reasonably anticipated needs (based on Buyer's forecasts and sales). Once Seller begins selling Buyer-Unique Products either in store or online, then such Products shall become HTS Products. If Seller stops selling an HTS Product at its FLS Stores, such Product shall become a Buyer-Unique Product if: (A) Buyer indicates it wishes to continue to sell such Product, (B) Seller is able to continue to purchase such Product on commercially reasonable terms, and (C) in the case of a Products branded with a KCD Mark, SBMC (as defined below) authorizes the sale of such product to Buyer as  set described in   Section 3(g)(ii). Buyer may request that Seller add additional Buyer-Unique Products from time to time and Seller will not unreasonably withhold or delay its approval of such items. Grounds for Seller denying such a request include issues such as: (x) Seller would not be fully reimbursed for its costs associated with such Product under this Agreement, (y) the new Buyer-Unique Product is outside of the specifications of Products handled at that time by Seller's supply chain organization (e.g., too big, too fragile), and (z) environmental or other regu latory concerns.

Upon completion of Buyer's PO System, Buyer shall purchase all Vendor-Unique Products as Buyer-Direct Merchandise.

SBMC has no obligation to agree to sell any KCD-Unique Products to Seller and may decline to do so in its sole and absolute discretion. KCD-Unique Products are Buyer-Unique Products under this Agreement for all purposes. 
Buyer-Unique Products are HTS Products under this Agreement for all purposes and will be priced as if they were HTS Products under   Section 3(b). The sale by Seller of a Buyer-Unique Product through Seller's Digital Methods does not result in that Product converting into an HTS Product and does not relieve Buyer of its obligations to purchase any Buyer-Unique Products consistent with its forecasting obligations detailed in   Appendices 1   and   6 .

 SHC'S SOLE OBLIGATION. As its sole obligation in this Agreement and unless Buyer has failed to comply with one or more of its material obligations in this Agreement and the failure is continuing, SHC will cause SRC, Kmart, and the Affiliates of each of them to take all actions that will enable Seller to perform, and not take any action that would disable to any extent Seller from performing, its obligations in this Agreement in accordance with their terms. For clarity, the parties note that this clause does not affect SBMC's right to approve or reject a p roposed KCD-Unique Product, in SBMC's sole discretion. 
 
 GENERAL . 
 
 Good Faith. SHC and the Parties each will exercise Good Faith in the performance of its obligations in this Agreement. 
 
 Assignment. Seller may at any time assign, delegate or subcontract its rights, or obligations or both, in whole or in part, under this Agreement except to a Seller Competitor, without the consent of Buyer. Subject to the next sentence, Buyer may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement (except to a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer), by operation of law or otherwise, without the express prior written consent of Seller, and any attempt to assign or assignment without the express prior written consent of Seller is void. Buyer may exercise all of its rights, and perform all of its obligations, under this Agreement through its wholly owned subsidiaries. 
 
 Computer Access. If either Party is given access, whether on-site or through remote facilities, to any communications, computer, or electronic data storage systems of the other Party or its Affil iates (each an " Electronic Resource"), in connection with this Agreement, then the Party given access will use such access solely to perform, and will not attempt to access any Electronic Resource other than those specifically required to perform, its obligations under this Agreement. The Party given access will limit such access to those of its Personnel who need to have such access in connection with this Agreement, will advise the other Party in writing of the name of each of its Personnel who will be granted such access, and will strictly follow all security rules and procedures for use of such Electronic Resources. All user identification numbers and passwords disclosed to a Party given access and any information obtained by the Party given access as a result of its access to, and use of such Electronic Resources will be deemed to be, and will be treated as, Confidential Information of the other Party. Each Party will cooperate with the other Party in the investigation of any apparent unauthorized access by the other Party, its Affiliates, or its Personnel to any Electronic Resources or unauthorized release of Confidential Information. Each Party will promptly notify the other Party of any actual or suspected unauthorized access or disclosure of any Electronic Resource. 
 
 Promotional Calendars. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law and consistent with practices in effect prior to the Effective Date, Seller will deliver to Buyer Seller's promotional calendars with respect to Products (including for Home Appliances, Tools, Lawn and Garden, Sporting Goods, Mattresses, and Consumer Electronics) as soon as they have been approved, including all amendments. Also consistent with practices prior to the Effect Date, the promotional calendars will include Seller's "master price files" (and substitute information) describing Sell er's retail and promotional pricing, as to which the Parties acknowledge that   Section 3(d)   and   Section 4(g)   are and will be applicable. 
 
 Negotiating Event . If a Negotiating Event occurs and thereafter a Party (the " Delivering Party ") delivers to the other Party (the " Receiving Party") an Opinion of Counsel that states that, as a consequence of the Negotiating Event the Delivering Party is unable, due to Applicable Law, to continue to perform any of the obliga tions to be performed by it in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement (an " Impediment"), Seller and Buyer will negotiate in Good Faith an amendment to this Agreement that would eliminate the Impediment. " Opinion of Counsel" means a written opinion (which may be reasoned) of a reputable law firm of national stature. The form and substance of the written opinion, and the law firm, will be subject to t he approval of the Receiving Party. " Negotiating Event" means the occurrence of any transaction or event, whether voluntary or involuntary, as a result of which a single stockholder or a Group ceases to be the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Securities and Exchange Commission Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of a majority of the total voting power of the then-outsta nding voting capital stock of SHC or SHO. 
 
 Consideration. Buyer has given, and Seller has received and accepted, adequate, good, sufficient, and valuable consideration for this Agreement, and for all purposes of this Agreement this Agreement is fully supported by adequate, good, sufficient, and valuable consideration provided by Buyer and received and accepted by Seller. Buyer's adequate, good, sufficient, and valuable consideration includes, without limitation, the mutual covenants, obligations, and promises herein and the following (which separately and together have enabled Seller to execute and deliver this Agreement and have assisted and will assist Seller's performance of its obligations under this Agreement): (i) Buyer has at great length discussed and upon reasonable request during the Term will discuss its business needs with Seller for the purpose of enabling Seller to make compelling business proposals to Buyer; (ii) Buyer has entered into negotiations with Seller that culminated in the execution and delivery of this Agreement, which Agreement gives Seller many advantages over other vendors; (iii) Buyer has provided and upon reasonable request during the Term will provide information to Seller about Buyer's operations; (iv) Seller has bargained for and, pursuant to this Agreement will receive, material benefits, interests, rights, and value from Buyer through such consideration and that Seller is not entitled to, and would not have received, such benefits, interests, rights, and value absent this Agreement; and (v) Buyer is obligated to purchase Products in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of   Sections 4(b)  and 4(a)(iii). This Agreement is legally binding; and Seller will not, directly or indirectly, plead or otherwise assert in any manner in any litigation, arbitration, mediation, or other dispute-resolution proceeding that this Agreement is invalid, void, voidable, revocable, terminable, or otherwise unenforceable for lack, inadequacy, or insufficiency of consideration; and by this Agreement Seller irrevocably waives and will be estopped from pleading or asserting, directly or indirectly, any cause of action, claim, defense, right, or  prayer for relief to such effect. Each of Seller's waivers in this   Section 22(f)   is reasonable and made with Seller's full knowledge of its significance and consequences. 
 
 Construction and Interpretation .

Seller and Buyer intend that this Agreement be construed without any rule requiring construction or interpretation against Seller, whose representatives drafted this Agreement. To the extent the Parties intend that a term or condition of this Agreement reflect policies and practices in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date, the Parties will negotiate in Good Faith to determine the policies and practices. 
 
 Counterparts; Facsimile. This Agreement may be executed in any number of separate counterparts, all of which, when taken together, will constitute one and the same instrument, notwithstanding the fact that all Parties did not sign the same counterpart. A signature transmitted to the other Party or its counsel by email or facsimile transmission will be effective to bind the Party whose signature was transmitted, as a duly executed and delivered original. Each Party will promptly deliver its original signature pages to this Agreement to counsel for the other Party promptly following execution, but any failure to do so will not affect the binding effect of such signature. 
 
 Entire Agreement; Severability.

This Agreement will not be supplemented, modified, or amended except by a written instrument signed by a duly authorized representative of each of Buyer and Seller. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and the terms and condition of any forecast, purchase order, or other order document, including any inconsistency as to any Product invoice price, the terms and conditions of this Agreement will control unless such other document constitutes an Amendment and expressly references and supersedes this Agreement. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the successors, representatives and permitted assigns of the Parties. The terms and conditions of this Agreement supersede and replace those of any prior negotiations and any documents that the Parties have exchanged in connection therewith (together, " Negotiation Documents"). Buyer and Seller represent and warrant that they are entering into this Agreement based solely on the provisions set forth herein and not in reliance, in whole or in part, on any claim or representation contained in any Negotiation Document. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect the validity or operation of any other provision and such invalid provision shall be deemed to be severed from the Agreement. 
 
 Injunctive Relief . Each Party acknowledges that any breach by a Party of   Section 12   or   Section 13  of this Agreement may cause the non-breaching Party and its Affiliates irreparable harm for which the non-breaching Party and its Affiliates have no adequate remedies at law. Accordingly, each Party and its Affiliates are entitled to seek injunctive relief, without complying with   Section 18(b)  and regardless of Buyer's cure rights, if any, for any such breach in any state or federal court in Chicago, Illinois, USA, and each Party consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts in Chicago, Illinois, USA for injunctive relief purposes. Each Party waives all claims for damages by reason of the wrongful issuance of an injunction and acknowledges that its only remedy in that case is the dissolution of that injunction.

 *Note:  Buyer currently receives DRM premium mattresses under this Agreement and the Vendors of such mattresses have not, to date, enforced any marketing limitations that would make it impracticable for Buyer to sell such Products at its Sears Outlet stores or on SearsOutlet.com (including any authorized successor thereto).  If the Vendors of such DRM premium mattresses do in the future enforce any such restrictions (other than those that Buyer has previously been complying with), and Buyer notifies Seller within writing within 60 days of such restriction being implemented that such restrictions are in fact significantly impacting Buyer's sales of such DRM premium mattresses at Sears Outlet stores (each a " PM Impairment Notice"); Seller will work in good faith to encourage such Vendors to agree to reasonable terms to permit such DRM premium mattresses continued sale at Sears Outlet stores.  Buyer must in each PM Impairment Notice specify: (i) the specific restriction which is impacting Buyer's sales of DRM premium mattresses, (ii) certify that Buyer was not previously complying with such restriction, and (iii) Buyer must estimate the amount of the impact (based upon actual sales data) on Buyer's future sales (which information Buyer will mark "Highly Confidential - Limited Distribution Internally).  If the Vendors do not agree to reasonable terms to permit continue sales of DRM premium mattresses by Sears Outlets stores within 60 days of Buyer's notice, Buyer may cease purchasing all DRM premium mattresses under this Agreement; in which case Seller shall be free to dispose of its premium mattresses in any manner, including by sale to a third party, with no ongoing obligation to Buyer.

 Appendix 4(g)(2) 
 Non-Saleable DRM Products Process 
 
 This process is applicable to   all  DRM Products received by Buyer's Outlet Repair and Distribution Centers (ORDCs) from Seller's MDO/DOS units that are determined to be Non-Saleable DRM Products in accordance with Appendix 4(g)(1) of the Amended and Restated Merchandising Agreement to which this Appendix is attached. 
 
 
 
 
 ORDC Responsibility 
 
 
 â€¢     Buyer will inspect all DRM Products within three (3) business days starting the first business day after physical receipt of the product by Buyer at Buyer's ORDC facility (but no later than 5 business days after delivery by Seller, e.g., the product is made available at co-located facilities and for other facilities, arrival of the trailer) (the "Inspection Period") and make an initial determination as to "Non-Saleable" status during that initial inspection. The Inspection Period will be extended on a day for day basis for SHO holidays and for Products received within three (3) business days of the start of a SHO inventory audit freeze period. 
 
 â€¢      The Non-Saleable DRM Product will be logged by Buyer on the Non-Saleable Products Log   Form on the date of inspection and tagged with a Non-Saleable Products Form 
 
 â€¢     All DRM Products initially determined to be Non-Saleable DRM Product will be moved by Buyer to a staging area immediately following initial non-saleable designation. 
 
 â€¢      ORDC General Manager (GM) must approve all Non-Saleable DRM Products daily 
 o      Non-saleable claim cannot be made until GM or ASM Ops (Ops Lead) approves 
 o      If the ORDC GM   approves Non-Saleable designation, the DRM Product Quality Inventory Control associate (PQIC) Inventory Control Lead (ICL) fills out the on-line Non-Saleable DRM Product Form via Seller's Non-Saleable Products Request Tool (or Seller's replacement therefor), and checks off the log that it was entered 
 â€¢     All entries must be entered as a positive number (meaning no minus sign in front of the sell/cost values) 
 â€¢     The non-saleable notification will automatically be routed to the MDO DOS Unit manager via email. The requestor (PQIC or ICL) will also receive a copy of the email which must be printed and filed in the BIRP 1-31 folder 
 
 â€¢     ORDC must claim a DRM item as non-saleable no later than 1 business day after the end of the Inspection Period. If a Product is missing Seller's paperwork (e.g., bill of lading or MDO DOS tag), Buyer will immediately notify Seller and segregate such Products the timelines set forth herein will be delayed until Seller provides such paperwork. 
 o     Upon Seller's written request in email made to Buyer's assigned Director of the applicable ORDCs, MDOs are to be provided weekly access to the ORDCs to verify load quality of items shipped to the ORDC by the MDO(s). 
 o     MDOs will send a request to verify load quality 48 hours in advance of the desired verification date. MDO load quality verification will occur on an agreed upon date between the ORDC and MDO. 
 o     All tags such as MDO DOS tags, 991 clearance tags (SDO, Full-Line) must remain on the DRM until expiration of Seller's review period (and any resulting dispute resolution period; failure to do will invalidate Buyer's right to seek reimbursement on that DRM item. 
 
 
 MDO/DOS Unit / ORDC Responsibility 
 
 
 
 â€¢     The MDO/DOS unit manager has 3 business days from the time the Non-Saleable DRM Product Request Tool email was sent to request visual inspection, beginning the first business day after the ORDC completes the online non-saleable submission 
 o     To request visual inspection, the MDO/DOS Unit manager must email the ORDC GM at the generic email ID SGXXXX@shos.com (where XXXX is the ORDC unit number) 
 o     If the MDO/DOS unit does not make a request within the allotted time, the merchandise can be transferred to the salvage area. 
 o      ORDC will not return non-saleable products to the MDO/DOS unit 
 
 
 â€¢     If a request is made by the MDO/DOS unit manager for visual inspection, within the required time, the ORDC must hold the product for 6 business days, beginning the first business day after the MDO requests a visual inspection 
 o     Product will be held in the HOLD for MDO inspection staging area within the ORDC while waiting for visual inspection 
 Â§     If no inspection is made within the allotted time, the ORDC may transfer the non-saleable DRM Product to the salvage area 
 
 
â€¢ Co-located MDOs are those that are physically attached to an ORDC. For those instances where a co-located MDO exists, the GM of that MDO will act as inspector for all remote MDOs that ship into that particular ORDC. This means that the remote MDOs will not request pictures from the receiving ORDC and that the co-located MDO GM will inspect product on their behalf if requested to do so by the remote MDO GM. All inspections, discussions, and dispute resolutions will take place between the co-located ORDC GM and co-located MDO GM. 
 
 o     For non-co-located facilities, then the ORDC GM will, upon email request from the MDO/DOS unit manager, arrange for the delivery of photographic evidence of the non-salable condition to the MDO/DOS unit manager for remote inspection. If such a request is made, the timeline for the MDO/DOS manager will not start until such photographic evidence is sent. The MDO/DOS manager may, at his/her option, also inspect the non-saleable DRM at Buyer's facility. If the non-co-located MDO GM does not reply back within the defined non-saleable process period (as described in the ORDC Responsibility and MDO/DOS Unit / ORDC Responsibility sections) then the item will be deemed non-salable and will be disposed of in accordance with the previously defined process. 
 
 â€¢     Should an inspection occur, the ORDC GM or ASM-Ops must complete the inspection with the MDO/DOS unit Manager or designee 
 o     If both parties agree that the item is non-saleable, the process continues consistent with this process. 
 o     If both parties agree that the item does not meet the non-saleable criteria, the ORDC PQIC or ICL will reverse the claim using the On-line Non-Saleable DRM Products Chargeback Form via Non-Saleable Outlet Products Request Tool 
 Â§      All credits to the MDO/DOS Unit  number must be entered as a negative number (meaning a minus sign is entered in front of the sell/cost values) 
 Â§     The credit must be entered by the ORDC no later than 2 business days after inspection deeming the product saleable 
 Â§      Merchandise will be moved to appropriate stage for processing 
 o     If both parties do not agree on the condition of the item, the parties will follow the Dispute Resolution portion of this process. 
 
 â€¢     After any in person or remote inspection of the non-salable product confirms its status, the ORDC will transfer the merchandise to the salvage area 
 o      ORDC will remove all merchandise nomenclature and follow merchandise salvage process 
 o      ORDC will not return the non-saleable products to the MDO/DOS unit 
 
 
 Disputes 
 
 
 
 â€¢     If there is a disagreement between parties, the MDO/DOS unit District Manager and Director of Outlet Distribution Centers should be engaged to resolve dispute. For all DRM items for which the parties do not agree upon its designation as non-saleable, Buyer shall retain the product until resolution of the dispute. 
 
 â€¢     Escalate to MDO/DOS unit region level or ORDC Vice President if the issue is not able to be resolved 
 
 
 Financial Entry Responsibilities

 ORDC Responsibility 
 Reconciling with SR02 
 
 â€¢     ORDC ICL should total all the requests made through the end of the fiscal month from the Log attaching the emails in the BIRP 1-31 folder 
 
 â€¢      Compare to the Non-Saleable entry on the final week of month's BIRP report 
 
 â€¢     If the sell values match, no further research is required and the emails from the 1-31 can be attached to the log and filed as documentation with the BIRP report

 Royalty Rates during the Renewal Period: 
The Royalty Rates for KCD-Branded Product that are major home appliances (divisions 022, 026, and 046 as described on  Appendix 3(a)), lawn mowers, and tractors will be the rates specified above in the column labeled "Royalty Rate before Deduction of the Kenmore Royalty Credit" (the " Initial-Term Rate "). 
The Royalty Rates for all other KCD-Branded Products will be determined in accordance with the following: 
 1.  Renewal Period . 
 (a)  Delivery of Comparable Market Royalty Rate . On or before the 270 th day immediately preceding the last day of the Initial Term Seller will deliver to Buyer a written schedule that indicates (i) the Comparable Market Royalty Rate for the Renewal Period for each KCD-Branded Product Category and (ii) a description of the calculations from which Seller determined the Comparable Market Royalty Rates. At the same time Seller will deliver to Buyer a certificate from a Senior Vice President of SHC certifying, to the Senior Vice President's best knowledge after due inquiry, that the Comparable Market Royalty Rates were calculated in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merchandising Agreement to which this  Appendix 5(a)  is attached and forms a part (the " Agreement") and that the Comparable Market Royalty Rates described on the certificate are true and correct. The date on which Seller makes the deliveries required by the preceding sentences of this  paragraph 1.a)  is the " FRP Delivery Date ." 
 (b)  Royalty Rate. If for a KCD-Branded Product Category the Initial-Term Rate is greater than the Comparable Market Royalty Rate for the Renewal Period, then the Initial-Term Rate will be the Royalty Rate for the KCD-Branded Product Category for the Renewal Period. Subject to  paragraph 1.c)  of this  Appendix 5(a), if for the KCD-Branded Product Category the Initial-Term Rate is less than the Comparable Market Royalty Rate for the Renewal Period, then the Comparable Market Royalty Rate for the Renewal Period will become the Royalty Rate for the KCD-Branded Product Category during the Renewal Period (the " FRP Adjusted Royalty Rate "). 
   
 (c)  Buyer's Rejection of the FRP Adjusted Royalty Rate; Seller's Termination Right. Buyer may reject the FRP Adjusted Royalty Rate for each KCD-Branded Product Category or any of them (each an " FRP Rejected Category ") by written notice delivered to Seller on or before the 30 th  day following the FRP Delivery Date (a " FRP Rejection Notice "). Subject to the last sentence of this  paragraph 1.c) , if Seller receives an FRP Rejection Notice then, on or before the 15 th day following Seller's receipt of the FRP Rejection Notice, Seller may either (i) terminate Seller's obligations in  Section 3 of the Agreement to sell to Buyer all KCD-Branded Products in the FRP Rejected Category, or (ii) terminate this Agreement, which termination referred to in clause (i) or clause (ii) will take effect on the last day of the Initial Term. If Seller receives an FRP Rejection Notice and does not exercise either of its termination rights described in, and in accordance with, the terms of the preceding sentence, then the Initial-Term Rate and not the Comparable Market Royalty Rate will become the Royalty Rate for the FRP Rejected Category during the Renewal Period. Seller may not exercise its termination rights in this  paragraph 1.c) if Seller or any of its Affiliates has failed to comply with any of its material obligations in the Agreement and the failure is continuing. 
 (d)  KCD Change in Control. If (i) a KCD Change in Control occurs during the Renewal Period, (ii) Seller does not exercise its rights in  Section 2(c)(ii)  of the Agreement, and (iii) after the effective date of the KCD Change in Control the  bona fide royalty rate paid by the Sears Full-Line stores to the acquiror of all of the KCD Marks in the KCD Change in Control (including all entities resulting from the KCD Change in Control and all successors, the " KCD Acquiror") for an Equivalent Product Category is greater the Royalty Rate then in effect for the equivalent KCD-Branded Product Category (a " FRP Greater Rate"), then on the first anniversary of the effective date of the KCD Change in Control the FRP Greater Rate will become the Royalty Rate during that portion of the remaining Term that the Sears Full-Line stores are obligated to pay to the KCD Acquiror the FRP Greater Rate for the Equivalent Product Category, subject to adjustment in accordance with  paragraph 2  of this  Appendix 5(a) with respect to the Renewal Period. If and when the FRP Greater Rate ceases to be payable by the Sears Full-Line stores the Royalty Rate will revert, for the remainder of the Renewal Period, to the Royalty Rate in effect immediately prior to the KCD Change in Control. 
 (e)  KCD Mark Acquisition. If (i) a KCD Mark Acquisition occurs, (ii) after the effective date of KCD Mark Acquisition Seller does not exercise its rights in  Section 2(d) of the Agreement, and (iii) at any time after the effective date of the KCD Mark Acquisition the royalty rate paid by the Sears Full-Line stores to the acquiror of the KCD Marks that comprised the KCD Mark Acquisition (including all entities resulting from the KCD-Mark Acquisition and all successors, the " KCD-Mark Acquiror") for an Equivalent Product Category is greater the Royalty Rate then in effect for the equivalent KCD-Branded Product Category (a " FRP MA Rate"), then on the first anniversary of the KCD-Mark Acquisition the FRP MA Rate will become the Royalty Rate for the KCD-Branded Product Category during the period that the Sears Full-Line stores are obligated to pay to the KCD-Mark Acquiror the FRP MA Rates for the Equivalent Product Category. When the Sears Full-Line stores cease to be obligated to pay the FRP MA Rate the Royal ty Rate will revert to the Royalty Rate in effect immediately prior to the KCD Mark Acquisition. 
 2.  Terms Defined for the Purposes of this Appendix 5(a) . 
 " Comparable Customer" means either (a) a wholesaler that purchases KCD-Branded Products from Seller for resale to end-user consumers in the Territory, or (b) Seller's licensee that Seller has licensed to arrange for the manufacture of KCD-Branded Products and their resale to end-user consumers in the Territory. 
 
 " Comparable Market Royalty Rate" for a KCD-Branded Product Category means the Initial-Term Rate for the KCD-Branded Product Category plus the mathematical product of (a) and (b), where (a) is the difference between (1) the Equivalent Economic Rate for the KCD-Branded Product Category earned by Seller from Comparable Customers during the twelve-month Seller fiscal period immediately preceding the FRP Delivery Date or the SRP Delivery Date, as the case may be, and (2) the Initial-Term Rate for the KCD-Branded Product Category, and (b) is the Volume Factor. 
 " Equivalent Economic Rate" for a KCD-Branded Product Category means the effective net product contribution profit earned by Seller with respect to the KCD-Branded Product Category as a percent of Seller's Retail-Equivalent Sales to all Comparable Customers for the KCD-Branded Product Category. For purposes of calculation, if with respect to any Comparable Customer the net product contribution profit is a royalty or a wholesale margin, then the royalty or wholesale margin will be adjusted to reflect the differences, if any, between (a) the allowances, credits, deductions, offsets, rebates, reimbursements, and other monetary benefits (such as payment terms) offered to the Comparable Customer and (b) the allowances, credits, deductions, offsets, rebates, reimbursements, and other monetary benefits (such as payment terms) offered to Buyer. If the net product contribution profit is a wholesale margin, then the net product contribution profit will be additionally adjusted to reflect costs of freight, duty, logistics, and distribution to achieve relative equivalency in comparing rates. " Seller's Retail Equivalent Sales" for the KCD-Branded Product Category will be calculated by grossing up non-retail sales based on Buyer's weighted average first-cost margin for the KCD-Branded Product Category or using such other basis on which Seller and Buyer mutually agree. For the purposes of calculating the Equivalent Economic Rate for a KCD-Branded Product Category, Seller will include only those products sold by Comparable Customers that are reasonably similar to KCD-Branded Products sold by Buyer that comprise the KCD-Branded Product Category. 
 " Equivalent Product Category" means a product category that includes products that are (i) sold by Seller to the Sears Full-Line stores and (ii) substantially similar with respect to features, benefits, quality, fit, finish, and ergonomics to the KCD-Branded Products in a KCD-Branded Product Category. 
 " KCD-Branded Product Category " means each of the following categories:

 Logical Separation is an operational separation, not a physical separation of inventory. 
 
 
 (A) 
 
Either Seller or Buyer may at any time request a logical separation of DC inventory, which if approved by Seller IM team, will be implemented. Absent such a request by either Party, the Inventory pool for all Products will not be logically separated. Once the Inventory for a particular SKU has been logically separated, it will not be logically combined again absent approval of  the Party who requested such separation. 
 
 
 (B) 
 
Regardless of whether the Inventory pool is logically separated or not, Seller is not obligated to physically separate the SHO Inventory. 
 
 
 
 (ii) 
 
Calculating logical separation of DC inventory for each Party to draw from is a function of relative demand forecasts entered into IDRP based upon 
 
 
 â€¢ 
 
Using relative demand forecasts to determine IDRP stocking targets in accordance with Seller's order feasibility logic for each Party 
 
 
 â€¢ 
 
 Entering relative demand forecasts by item, by week and by DC by each Party 
 
 
 â€¢ 
 
Establishing how much time is required to fulfill demand is a function of order feasibility logic parameters within IDRP: 
 
 
 o 
 
 Varies by Vendor production point of origin 
 
 
 o 
 
 Determined by Vendor production planning cycle and total lead-times 
 
 
 â€¢ 
 
 Calculating demand forecasts is a function within IDRP generated by:     
 
 
 o 
 
 Establishing each store reorder points by users 
 
 
 o 
 
 Downloading store on hand and store on order counts from RIM 
 
 
 o 
 
 Entering sales forecasts by users 
 
 
 o 
 
 Entering floor set quantities by users

 (G) 
 
 Execution of inbound DC PO's is a function of the Seller IM teams 
 
 
 (H) 
 
Supplying plans for Buyer demand that exceeds prior Buyer forecasts where typical order feasibility logic does not supply Vendors ample time to produce larger than normal volumes of product is also required 
 
 
 (I) 
 
Forecasting the demand impacts of new store openings and store closings must be completed within order feasibility parameters by Buyer or prior demand forecast will dictate logical separation of inventory for Buyer 
 
 
 
 (iv) 
 
 Party ordering logic applicable to either Party at the item level:

If Buyer doesn't wish to participate in such transfer (and pay the related costs), Buyer must elect to have a logical separation of the Inventory for the affected SKUs; which election will be irrevocable until the current inventory is sold through. If Buyer does not elect to separate the Inventory, then Buyer shall be deemed to approve the branch transfer and will be liable for its share of the related costs. 
 
 
 (2) 
 
Logically Separated and Buyer-Unique Products. Buyer may request, from time to time, branch transfers for Inventory for its portion of logically separated Inventory and for Buyer-Unique Products.
