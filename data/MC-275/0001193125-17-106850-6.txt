Section 409A of the Code, including, where applicable, the requirement that (i) any reimbursement be for expenses incurred during Employee's lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement), (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other calendar year, (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred, and  (iv) the right to reimbursement is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if a payment or benefit under this Agreement is due to a "separation from service" for purposes of the rules under Treas. Reg. Â§ 1.409A-3(i)(2) (payments to specified employees upon a separation from service) and Employee is determined to be a "specified employee" (as determined under Treas. Reg. Â§ 1.409A-1(i)), such payment or benefit shall, to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, be made or provided on the later of the date specified by the foregoing provisions of this Agreement or the date that is six months after the date of Employee's separation from service (or, if earlier, the date of Employee's death). Any installment payments that are delayed pursuant to this Section 10 shall be accumulated and paid in a lump sum on the first day of the seventh month following Employee's separation from service, and the remaining installment payments shall begin on such date in accordance with the schedule provided in this Agreement.
