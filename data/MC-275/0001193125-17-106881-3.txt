 SEPARATION AND TRANSITION AGREEMENT 
THIS SEPARATION AND TRANSITION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of October 30, 2016, by and between NCI, Inc. (the "Company"), on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries and af filiates (collectively, the "Company Group"), and Brian J. Clark ("Executive"). 
 WHEREAS, Executive is employed by the Company as its President and Chief Executive Officer; 
 WHEREAS, Executive desires to resign from employment with the Company Group; and 
WHEREAS, to facilitate his transition, Executive agrees to cooperate with the Company on the terms and conditions set forth herein. 
 Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows: 
 1.  Resignation . 
 1.1 Removal from Positions. Executive shall resign from employment with the Company Group on October 31, 2016 (such date, the "Resignation Date"). In that regard, as of the Resignation Date, (a) Executive's position as President of the Company and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, (b) Executive's position as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") and (c) all other officer positions, directorships and other positions that Executive holds with the Company Group shall terminate. 
 1.2  Release. Executive's receipt of any payments and benefits pursuant to this Agreement (other than the payments and benefits pursuant to Sections 3.1(a), 3.1(b) and 4 (the "Accrued Obligations")) is subject to Executive's executing this Agreement and not revoking the release set forth in Section 7;  provided that the release is effective within 10 days following the Resignation Date. No payments or benefits under this Agreement (other than the Accrued Obligations) shall be paid or provided to Executive until the release becomes effective in accordance with the deadline specified in the preceding sentence. 
 2.  Transition . 
 2.1  Consulting Period and Services . Commencing on the Resignation Date and ending on the  six-month anniversary thereof (the "Consulting Period"), Executive shall make himself available to the Company to consult with the Company from time to time (the "Services");  provided that the Services shall not exceed 20% of the average level of services that Executive performed during the  36-month  period prior to the Resignation Date. 
 2.2  Consulting Fee. In exchange for the Services, the Company agrees to pay Executive a total fee equal to $250,000 (the "Consulting Fee"). The Consulting Fee shall be paid to Executive ratably on a monthly basis over the Consulting Period commencing November 1, 2016; provided Executive has executed and not revoked the release in Section 7 and complied with his obligations in Section 8. Except as to the Consulting Fee, no other payments or benefits shall be due or payable to Executive for the Services. 
 
 
 2.3  Status as an Independent Contractor. In all matters relating to the Services, nothing under this Agreement shall be construed as creating any partnership, joint venturer or agency between the Company and Executive or to constitute Executive as an agent, employee or representative of the Company. Executive shall act solely as an independent contractor and, as such, is not authorized to bind any member of the Company Group to third parties. Consequently, Executive shall not be entitled to participate during the Consulting Period in any of the employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements of the Company Group in his capacity as a consultant. Executive shall be responsible for and pay all taxes related to the receipt of compensation in connection with the provision of the Services. Executive shall not make any public statements concerning the Services that purport to be on behalf of the Company Group, in each case without  prior written consent from the Company. 
 2.4  Subsequent Employment. The Services shall end and the unpaid portion of the Consulting Fee shall be accelerated and paid in full when Executive notifies the Company that he has obtained full-time emplo yment with a new employer. 
 3.  Severance Benefits . 
 3.1  Payments. The Company shall provide Executive with the following severance payments and benefits following the Resignation Date: 
 a. any accrued but unpaid annual base salary and accrued but unused paid  time-off  due to Executive as of the Resignation Date; 
b. reimbursement for reasonable and necessary, properly-receipted expenses incurred by Executive on behalf of the Company during the period ending on the Resignation Date; 
c. a cash payment equal to 200% of Executive's annual base salary in the amount of $1,000,000, payable in a lump sum; and 
d. a prorated annual bonus equal to $420,000 for the period beginning on January 1, 2016 and ending on the Resignation Date, payable in a lump sum. 
 3.2  Payment Timing. Subject to Section 10, the timing of the benefits and payments provided under Section 3.1 shall be as follows: 
a. amounts payable pursuant to Sections 3.l(a) and (b) shall be paid in the normal course and in no event later than 30 days following the Resignation Date; and 
b. the amounts payable pursuant to Sections 3.l(c) and (d) shall be paid no later than the 30th day following the Resignation Date. 
 4.  Outstanding Equity Awards. In connection with Executive's resignation from employment, the Company shall repurchase the Stock Options (as defined below) for $2,652,300, which represents an amount equal to (a) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.19 per share (each, a "Share"), of the Company underlying the Stock Options, multiplied by (b) the Purchase Price (as  defined below) less the applicable per Share 
   
 2

For purposes of this Agreement, "Purchase Price" means $11.95, which represents the closing sale price of a Share on The Nasdaq Stock Market as of October 28, 2016, and "Stock Options" means Executive's option to purchase 300,000 Shares granted under the NCI, Inc. Amended and Restated 2005 Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan") on June 5, 2013 at an exercise price of $4.51 per Share and Executive's option to purchase 90,000 Shares granted under the Plan on March 9, 2012 at an exercise price of $7.28 per Share, all of which are vested and exercisable as of the Resignation Date. The closing of the repurchase of the Stock Options shall occur within 30 days following the Resignation Date, at which time the Company shall pay the aggregate purchase price to Executive in cash. For the avoidance of doubt, all other outstanding equity-based awards held by Executive which are not vested or exercisable as of the Resignation Date shall be cancelled for no consideration. 
 5.  Retirement Plans. Executive shall be entitled to receive his vested accrued benefits, if any, under the NCI Information Systems, Inc. 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and the NCI Nonqualified Executive  Deferred Compensation Plan in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plans. 
 6.  Continuation of Certain Benefit Plans. The Company will provide Health and Welfare Coverage and Executive's Executive Long Term Disability Coverage (for the plans and options currently in effect as elected by Executive) at no additional cost to Executive from the date hereof through October 31, 2017, subject to the terms of the applicable plans. Except for the foregoing or as otherwise specifically provided herein or as required by the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act or other applicable law, Executive shall not be entitled to any other benefits or to participate in any past, present or future employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements of the Company Group on or after the Resignation Date.

Further, nothing in this Section 8.5 or this Agreement shall prevent Executive or the Company from answering inquiries or questions about, and providing honest opinions about and/or comparing the services offered by the Company to the services offered by any person or entity for whom Executive works. The Company shall provide Executive with a positive letter of recommendation at any time upon his request. 
 8.6  Remedies. Executive acknowledges that Executive has carefully read and considered all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the restraints imposed upon him pursuant to Sections 8.1 through 8.5. Executive agrees without reservation that each of the restraints contained herein is necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the goodwill, Confidential Information and other legitimate interests of the Company Group; that each and every one of those restraints is reasonable in respect to subject matter, length of time and  geographic area; and that these restraints, individually or in the aggregate, shall not prevent 
   
 6 
 
 
Executive from obtaining other suitable employment during the period in which Executive is bound by these restraints. Without intending to limit the remedies available to the Company, Executive agrees that a breach (or threatened breach) of any of the covenants contained in Sections 8.1 through 8.5 may result in material and irreparable injury to the Company Group for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it shall not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of such a breach or threat thereof, the Company shall be entitled to seek a temporary restraining order or a preliminary or permanent injunction, or both, without bond or other security, restraining Executive from engaging in activities prohibited by the covenants contained in Sections 8.1 through 8.5 or such other relief as may be required specifically to enforce any of the covenants contained in this Agreement.

Executive acknowledges and the Company agrees that Executive may disclose Confidential Information in confidence, directly or indirectly, to federal, state, or local government officials, including but not limited to the Department of Justice, the SEC, the Congress, and any agency Inspector General or to an attorney, for the sole purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law or regulation or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of state or federal laws or regulations. Executive may also disclose Confidential Information in a document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, but only if the filing is made under seal. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to conflict with federal law protecting confidential disclosures of a trade secret to the government or in a court filing, 18 U.S.C. ยง 1833(b), or to create liability for dis closures of Confidential Information that are expressly allowed by 18 U.S.C. ยง 1833(b). 
 10.  Section 409A. This Agreement is intended to meet, or be exempt from, the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations and interpretive guidance promulgated thereunder (collectively, "Section 409A"), with respect to amounts subject thereto, and shall be interpreted and construed consistent with that intent. No expense s eligible for reimbursement, or  in-kind benefits to be provided, during any calendar year shall affect the amounts eligible for reimbursement in any other calendar year, to the extent subject to the requirements of Section 409A, and no such right to reimbursement or right to in-kind benefits shall be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. For purposes of Section 409A, each payment in a series of installment payments provided under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment. Any payments to be made under this Agreement upon a termination of employment shall only be made upon a "separation from service" under Section 409A. If amounts payable under this Agreement do not qualify for exemption from Section 409A at the time of Executive's separation from service and therefore are deemed deferred compensation subject to the requirements of Section 409A on the date of such separation from service, then if Executive is a "specified employee" under Section 409A on the date of Executive's separation from service, payment of the amounts hereunder shall be delayed for a period of six m onths from the date of Executive's separation from service if required by Section 409A. 
   
 7 
 
 
 The accumulated postponed amount shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days after the end of the  six-month period. If Executive dies during the postponement period prior to payment of the postponed amount, the amounts withheld on account of Section 409A shall be paid to Executive's est ate within 30 days after the date of Executive's death. 
 11.  Change in Control Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Executive Change in Control and Severance Agreement, dated as of March 9, 2012, between Executive and the Company shall terminate effective as of  the Resignation Date and shall be of no further force and effect. 
 12.  Miscellaneous . 
 12.1  Severability. As the provisions of this Agreement are independent of and severable from each other, the Company and Executive agree that if, in any action before any court or agency legally empowered to enforce this Agreement, any term, restriction, covenant, or promise hereof is found to be unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable, then such decision shall not affect the validity of the other provisions of this Agreement, and such invalid term, restriction, covenant, or promise shall also be deemed modified to the extent necessary to make it enfo rceable. 
 12.2  Notice. For purposes of this Agreement, notices, demands and all other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when received if delivered in person, the next business day if delivered by overnight commercial courier (e.g., Federal Express), or the third business day if mailed by United States ce rtified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, and via  e-mail,  to the following addresses:
