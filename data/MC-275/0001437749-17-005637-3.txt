WHEREAS, Employer recognizes that it is important to Employer and its stockholders to have stability and continuity in its executive management; 
   
WHEREAS, Employee desires job stability in order to devote his focus and energies on the management of Employer without concern over long-term implications on his career based on s hort-term considerations; 
   
WHEREAS, Employer also recognizes, as is the case with many publicly held corporations, the possibility that a change in control may arise and that such possibility, and the uncertainty and questions which it may raise among executive management, may result in the departure or distraction of executive management personnel to the detriment of Employer and the  shareholders of Employer; 
   
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of HomeTown Bank and HomeTown Bankshares (collectively, the "Board") have determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of Employer's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer to his duties without distraction by the possibility of a change in con trol of Employer; 
   
WHEREAS, the Board believes it important, should Employer or the shareholders of Employer receive a proposal for transfer of control of Employer, that Employee, as a member of the Executive Management of Employer, be able to assess such proposal and advise the Boards thereon, without being unduly influenced by the uncertainties of Employee's personal situati on; 
   
WHEREAS, Employer and Employee now desire to formalize said employment with a formal Employment Agreement, including change in control provisions. 
   
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 6.01 For purposes of this Agreement, a "change in control" of Employer shall have occurred at such time as (a) the Federal Reserve Board should have approved a notice filed by any Person (as defined in subsection 1.10) with respect to Employer pursuant to 12 C.F.R.

 SECTION   VI I .  COMPENSATION UPON TERMINATION FOLLOWING CHANGE IN CONTROL; OTHER AGREEMENTS . 
   
 7.01 During any period following a change in control that Employee fails to perform his duties as a result of incapacity due to physical or mental illness, Employee shall continue to receive his salary at the rate then in effect and any benefits or awards under any Plans shall continue to accrue during such period, to the extent not inconsistent with such Plans, until Employee's employment is terminated pursuant to and in accordance with Section VI hereof. Thereafter, Employee's compensation and other benefits shall be determined in ac cordance with subsection 7.02 hereof and the Plans then in effect. 
   
 7.02 Subject to subsections 6.01 and 7.04 and Section X hereof, if a change in control shall have occurred, as defined in Section V above, and Employee's employment with Employer is terminated by Employer, then Employee shall be entitled, without regard to any contrary provisions of any Plan, to the following benefits: 
   
(A)     For thirty-six (36) months less one day, commencing on the Date of Termination, Employer shall continue to provide Employee all perquisites which were being provided to Employee immediately prior to the Date of Termination and shall make provisions and pay all insurance premiums as they come due during such period so that Employee's medical insurance benefits, life insurance and accident insurance plan coverage will continue to be on terms and at levels substantially the same as those existing on the day prior to the Date of T ermination. 
   
(B)     For thirty-six (36) months less one day, commencing on the Date of Termination, Employer shall continue to pay to Employee the Annual Compensation theretofore received by Employee from Employer. For purposes of this Agreement, "Annual Compensation" shall mean Employee's current annual base salary immediately preceding the change in control or immediately preceding the Date of Termination, whichever is the greater, in accordance with Section 3.01 hereof. Payment shall be made each month when the Employer's payroll is customarily paid unless Employee irrevocably elects to receive all salary compensation due hereunder in a lump sum which shall be paid within thirty (30) days of the Employee's election. Should Employee elect to receive a lump sum settlement instead of monthly payments, the amount payable shall be reduced to the present value of monthly payments by using the one year  certificate of deposit rate then in effect at HomeTown Bank. 
   
(C)     Should there be a distribution from any executive incentive compensation plan at the close of the plan year during which termination occurs, Employee shall in addition be p aid the amount provided for in Section 3.01 hereof. 
   
(D)     Employee shall be or become vested under all employee benefit, retirement and stock option plans under which Employee is a beneficiary as of the date when the last compensa tion under this Agreement is due to be paid to Employee. 
   
 7.03 The amount of any payment provided for in this Section VII shall not be reduced, offset, or subject to recovery by Employer by reason of any compensation earned by Employee as a result of subsequent employment by another employer other than a competing banking institution in violation of subsection 8.02 of Section VIII hereof. 
   
 7.04 Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section VII, should Employer terminate Employee for intentional misconduct tantamount to the commission of a felony and relating to his employment, no further compensation shall be paid to Employee after the Date of Termination. Otherwise, Employee shall be entitled to the full compensation provided for in this Section VII after his termination, subject, however, to the provisions of subsection 6.01 of Section VI. 
   
 SECTION   VIII . CONFIDENTIALITY; COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE. 
   
 8 .01  Confidentiality. Employee agrees that subsequent to his period of employment with Employer, he will not at any time communicate or disclose to any unauthorized person, without the express prior written consent of the Employer, its operations, finances, condition, properties, assets, business or strategic plans, employees, budgets, or any other matter, it being understood, however, that the obligations of this Section shall not apply to the extent that the aforesaid matters (1) are disclosed in circumstances where Employee is legally required to do so or (ii) become generally known to and available for use by the public otherwise than by the Employee's wrongful act. 
   
 8 .02  Covenant Not to Compete. If (i) the Employee's employment with the Employer or Bank is terminated without Cause as defined in Section 1.02 above, and the Employee has received the payments described in Section 4.03 above, or (ii) the Employee's employment with Employer is terminated for Cause pursuant to Section 1.02(b) or (c) above, or (iii) Employee resigns his position with Employer, the Employee agrees that for a period of two years from the date his employment is terminated, he will not, without the prior, express consent in writing of the Chairman of the Board of Directors or Successors, become affiliated within a 40 mile radius of the main office of the Employer as an officer, employee, agent, partner, director, consultant, or substantial stockholder (more that 5% of any class of common or preferred equity, options to acquire the same or convertible debt) of any entity engaged in the commercial or retail banking, lending or leasing business or become associated within the geographical area described above with any entity in the process of formation to engage in the retail or commercial banking, lending or leasing business, or any group that intends to form any such entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is recognized that many banks have offices or other operations within a 40-mile radius of the main office of the Employer and Employee is not prohibited from employment with such a bank provided that Employee's office is located outside the restricted 40-mile radius and Employee does not, directly or indirectly, knowingly solicit business from or do business with any customers of Employer. 
   
 8 .03  Relief. In the event Employee's actual or threatened breach of this Section, Employer or Successor, as the case may be, shall be entitled to a preliminary restraining order and an injunction restraining the Employee from violating its provisions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Employee agrees that it shall pay all costs and expenses of Employer, including but not limited to reasonable expert witness and legal fees, should it prevail, in any litigation to enforce this Section VIII. 
   
 8 .04  Other Remedies. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prohibit the Company or Successor from pursuing any other available remedies for such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of damages from the Employee. If at the time of enforcement of this Section a court holds that the duration, scope or area restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under the circumstances then existing and, thus, unenforceable, the Employer and Employee agree that the maximum duration, scope or area reasonable under such circumstances shall be sub stituted for the stated duration, scope or area.

 SECTION   I X .  SUCCESSORS; BINDING AGREEMENT . 
   
 9.01 This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon any corporate or other successor of Employer which shall result from a change in control as defined in Section V hereof. Employer shall require any such successor, by an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Employee, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent as Employer would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. 
   
 9.02 This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Employee's personal or legal representative, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees, and legatees. If Employee should die while any amount would still be payable to Employee hereunder at the time of death of Employee, such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to Employee's devisee, legatee, beneficiary, or designee or, if there be no such designee, to Employee's estate. 
   
 SECTION X .  TAXES . 
   
 10.01 All payments to be made to Employee under this Agreement will be subject to required withholding of federal, state and local income and employment taxes. 
   
 10.02 Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that mutually satisfactory independent auditors (the "Auditors") shall determine that any payment or distribution by Employer to or for Employee's benefit (whether paid or payable or distributed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise) (a "Payment") would be a "parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), then the aggregate present value of amounts payable or distributable to or for Employee's benefit  pursuant to this Agreement are hereinafter referred to as "Agreement Payments." 
   
 10.03 If any of the Agreement Payments will be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code or any similar tax that may hereafter be imposed (the "Excise Tax"), Employer shall pay to Employee at the time specified below an additional amount (the "Gross-up Payment") such that the net amount retained by Employee, after deduction of any Excise Tax on the Agreement Payments and any federal, state and local income tax and Excise Tax upon the Gross-up Payment, but before deduction for any federal, state or local income tax on the Agreement Payments, shall be equal to the total amount of the Agreed Payments. 
   
 10.04 For purposes of determining whether any of the Agreement Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (i) the total Agreement Payments shall be treated as "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code, and all "excise parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax, unless in the opinion of tax counsel selected by the Auditors, such other payments or benefits (in whole or in part) do not constitute parachute payments, or such excess parachute payments (in whole or in part) represent reasonable compensation for services actually rendered within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code in excess of the base amount within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code or are otherwise not subject to the Excise Tax, (ii) the amount of the Agreement Payments which shall be treated as subject to the Excise Tax shall be equal to the lesser of (A) the total amount of the Agreed Payments or (B) the amount of excess parachute payments within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code (after applying clause (i) above), and (iii) the value of any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined by the Auditors in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. 
   
 10.05 For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-up Payment, Employee shall be deemed to pay federal income taxes at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation for the calendar year in which the Gross-up Payment is to be made and the applicable state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation for the calendar year in which the Gross-up Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes. In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Gross-up Payment is made, Employee shall repay to Employer at the time that the amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally determined the portion of the Gross-up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus the portion of the Gross-up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and federal, state and local income tax imposed on the portion of the Gross-up Payment being repaid by Employee if such repayment results in a reduction in Excise Tax and/or a federal, state and local income tax deduction), plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the applicable federal rate. In the event that the Excise Tax is determined to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder at the time the Gross-up Payment is made (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-up Payment), Employer shall make an additional Gross-up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest payable with respect  to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined. 
   
 10.06 The Gross-up Payment or portion thereof provided for above shall be paid not later than the thirtieth (30 th) day following payment of any amounts under Section VI; provided, however, that if the amount of such Gross-Up Payment or portion thereof cannot be finally determined on or before such day, Employer shall pay to Employee on such day an estimate, as determined in good faith by Employer, of the minimum amount of such payments and shall pay the remainder of such payment (together with interest at the applicable federal rate) as soon as the amount thereof can be determined, but in no event later than the forty-fifth (45 th) day after payment of any amounts under Section VI. In the event that the amount of the estimated payments exceeds the amount subsequently determined to have been due, such excess  shall constitute a loan by Employer to Employee, payable on the fifth (5 th ) day after demand by Employer (together with interest at the applicable federal rate). 
   
 10.07 All determinations made by the Auditors pursuant to this Section X shall be binding upon Employer and Employee. 
   
 10.08 It is intended that this Agreement comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and guidance of general applicability issued thereunder (referred to herein as "Section 409A") so as to not subject Employee to the payment of additional interest and taxes under Section 409A. In furtherance of this intent, this Agreement shall be interpreted, operated and administered in a manner consistent with these intentions, and to the extent Section 409A would result in Employee being subject to the payment of additional income taxes or interest under Section 409A, the parties agree to amend the Agreement to avoid the application of such taxes and interest. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, as needed to comply with Section 409A, if Employee is a "specified employee" (within the meaning of Section 409A), deferred payments due under this Agreement above shall be subject to a six (6) month delay such that amounts otherwise payable during the six (6) month period following Employee's Separation from Service (as defined pursuant to Section 409A and the regulations thereunder) shall be accumulated and paid in a lump-sum catch-up payment as of the first day of the seventh month following Employee' s Separation from Service.
