forth in Section 3.2 for such Participants).

In addition, the Committee shall establish from time to time such other enrollment requirements as it determines, in its sole discretion, are necessary.

 ARTICLE III 
 CONTRIBUTIONS  & DEFERRAL ELECTIONS 
 
 3.1 Elections to Defer Compensation. Elections to defer Compensation shall take the form of a whole percentage (less applicable payroll withholding requirements for Social Security and income taxes and employee bene fit plans, as determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the Committee) of up to a   maximum   of: 
 
 (1) 100% of Base Salary, 
 (2) 100% of Bonuses, and 
 (3) 100% of Director's Fees. 
 
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, adjust for subsequent Plan Years on a prospective basis the maximum deferral percentages described in this Section for one or more types of Compensation (including, without limitation, for particular types of Bonuses) and for one or more subsequent Plan Years; such revised deferral percentages shall be indicated on a Participant Election form approved by the Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the maximum deferral percentages be adjusted after the last date on which deferral elections for the applicable type(s) of Compensation must be submitted and become irrevocable in accordance with Section 3.2 below and the requirements of Code Section 409A. In addition to the deferral types described above, the Committee may permit a Participant to make a 401(k) Refund Offset Amount election for a Plan Year, in accordance with the de ferral election timing requirements in Section 3.2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
below and as further described in a Participant Election form. By way of example, the Committee may permit a Participant to elect to defer a 401(k) Refund Offset Amount for the 2018 Plan Year by submitting an election no later than December 31, 2017; such election would provide for an additional deferral of Base Salary in 2018 equal to any refund amount that  is distributed to the Participant during the 2018 Plan Year from the Qualified Plan. 
 
 3.3 Timing of Deferral Elections; Effect of Participant Election(s). 
 
 (a) General Timing Rule for Deferral Elections. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3.2, in order for a Participant to make a valid election to defer Compensation, the Participant must submit Participant Election(s) o n or before the deadline established by the Committee, which shall be no later than the December 31 st  preceding the Plan Year in which such Compensation will be earned. Any deferral election made in accordance with this Section 3.2(a) shall be irrevocable; provided, however, that if the Committee permits or requires Participants to make a deferral election by the deadline described above for an amount that qualifies as Performance-Based Compensation, the Committee may permit a Participant to subsequently change his or her deferral election for such Performance-Based Compensation by submitting new Participant Election(s) in accordance  with Section 3.2(c) below. 
 
 (b) Timing of Deferral Elections for New Plan Participants.  An Eligible Executive who first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan on or after the beginning of a Plan Year, as determined in accordance with Treas. Reg. Â§1.409A-2(a)(7)(ii) and the "plan aggregation" rules provided in Treas. Reg. Â§1.409A-1(c)(2), may be permitted to make an election to defer the portion of Compensation attributable to services to be performed after such election, provided that the Participant submits Participant Election(s) on or before the deadline established by the Committee, which in no event shall be later than thirty (30) days after the Participant first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan. If a deferral election made in accordance with this Section 3.2(b) relates to compensation earned based upon a specified performance period, the amount eligible for deferral shall be equal to (i) the total amount of compensation for the performance period, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days remaining in the service period after the Participant's deferral election is made, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the performance period. Any deferral election made in accordance with this Section 3.2(b) shall become irrevocable no later than the 30 th   day after the date the Participant first becomes eligible to participate in the Plan. 
 
 (c) Timing of Deferral Elections for Performance-Based Compensation .  Subject to the limitations described below, the Committee may determine that an irrevocable deferral election for an amount that qualifies as Performance-Based Compensation may be made by submitting Participant Election(s) on or before the deadline established by the Committee, which in no event shall be later than six (6) months before the end of the performance period, and in no event before any amount of the Performance-Based Compensation has become "readily ascertainable" within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Â§1.409A-2(a)(8). In order for a Participant to be eligible to make a deferral election for Performance-Based Compensation in accordance with the deadline established pursuant to this Section 3.2(c), the Participant must have performed services continuously from the later of (i) the beginning of the performance period for such compensation, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or (ii) the date upon which the performance criteria for such compensation are established, through the date upon which the Participant makes the deferral election for such compens ation. 
 
 (d) Timing Rule for Deferral of Compensation Subject to Risk of Forfeiture. With respect to compensation (i) to which a Participant has a legally binding right to payment in a subsequent year, and (ii) that is subject to a forfeiture condition requiring the Participant's continued services for a period of at least twelve (12) months from the date the Participant obtains the legally binding right, the Committee may determine that an irrevocable deferral election for such compensation may be made by timely delivering Participant Election(s) to the Committee in accordance with its rules and procedures, no late r than the 30 th  day after the Participant obtains the legally binding right to the compensation, provided that the election is made at least twelve (12) months in advance of the earliest date at which the forfeiture condition could lapse, as determined in accordance with Treas. Reg. Â§1.409A-2(a)(5). Any deferral election(s) made in accordance with this Section 3.2(d) shall  become irrevocable no later than the 30 th  day after the Participant obtains the legally binding right to the compensation subject to such deferral election(s). 
    
 (e) Separate Deferral Elections for Each Plan Year. In order to defer Compensation for a Plan Year, a Participant must submit a separate deferral election with respect to Compensation for such Plan Year by affirmatively filing a Participant Election during the enrollment period established by the Committee prior to the beginning of such Plan Year (or at such other time contemplated under this Section 3.2), which election shall be effective on the first day of the next following Plan Year (unless otherwise specified on the Participant Election). 
 
 3.3 Bank Contributions . 
   
 (a) Discretionary Bank Contributions. The Bank shall have the discretion to make discretionary Bank Contributions to the Plan at any time and in any amount on behalf of any Participant. Bank Contributions shall be made in the complete and sole discretion of the Bank and no Participant shall have the right to receive any Bank Contribution in any particular Plan Year regardless of whether Bank C ontributions are made on behalf of other Participants. 
 
 (b) Bank Matching Contributions. The Bank shall make a matching contribution to each Participant's Bank Contribution Account for each Plan Year in which the Participant makes an elective deferral under this Plan, which shall be up to the maximum matching contributions that the Bank would have made to the Participant's account under the Qualified Plan had the Participant's elective deferral been contributed to the Qualified Plan without regard to any statutory or regulatory limitations on salary reduction or matching contributions to the Qualified Plan, or on compensation taken into account in calculating employer or employee contributions to the Qualified Plan (the " Bank Matching Contribution"); provided, however, the Bank Matching Contribution for each Plan Year shall be reduced by the amount of Bank contributions actually credited to the Participant under the Qualified Plan for such Plan Year. The Bank will make the above-referenced matching contribution with respect to each Participant, except to the extent prohibited or limited by law in which case no such contribution shall be made and any matching contributions previously made which are prohibited or limited by such law shall be forfeited and returned to the Bank. The amount of the Bank Matching Contribution added to the Participant's Bank Contribution Account is dependent on the applicable formula for matching contributions under the Qualifi ed Plan. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3.4 Investment Elections . 
   
 (a) Participant Designation. At the time of entering the Plan and/or of making a deferral election under the Plan, the Participant shall designate, on a Participant Election provided by the Committee, the Funds in which the Participant's Accounts shall be deemed to be invested for purposes of determining the amount of earnings and losses to be credited to each Account. The Participant may specify that all or any percentage of his or her Accounts shall be deemed to be invested, in whole percentage increments, in one or more of the Funds selected as alternative investments under the Plan from time to time by the Committee pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. If a Participant fails to make an election among the Funds as described in this section, the Participant's Account balance shall automatically be allocated into a default Fund, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. A Participant may change any designation made under this Section as permitted by the Committee by filing a revised election, on a Participant Election provided by the Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may impose limitations on the frequency with which one or more of the Funds elected in accordance with this Section may be added or deleted by such Participant; furthermore, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may impose limitations on the frequency with which the Participant may change the portion of his or her Account balance allocated to each previously or newly elected Fund. In addition, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, disregard a Participant's designation of a Fund on a P articipant Election. 
   
 (b) Investment Funds. The Committee may select, in its sole and absolute discretion, each of the types of commercially available investments communicated to the Participant pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section to be the Funds. The Interest Rate of each such commercially available investment shall be used to determine the amount of earnings or losses to be credited to the Participant's Account under Article IV. The Participant's choice among investments shall be solely for purposes of calculation of the Crediting Rate on Accounts. The Bank shall have no obligation to set aside or invest amounts as directed by the Participant and, if the Bank elects to invest amounts as directed by the Participant, the Participant shall have n o more right to such investments than any other unsecured general creditor. 
 
 3.5 Distribution Elections . 
 
 (a) Initial Election. At the time of making a deferral election under the Plan, the Participant shall designate the time and form of distribution of deferrals made pursuant to such election (together with any earnings credited thereon) from among the alternatives specified under Article VI for the applicable distribution. At the time of a Participant's initial enrollment in the Plan, a Participant must elect the form of distribution for the Participant's Accounts. The form of distribution may be (i) a lump sum; (ii) substantially equal annual installments over up to fifteen (15) years for the Retirement Account; and (iii) substantially equal annual installments over up to four (4) years for a Scheduled Distribution Account. A new distribution election may be made at the time of subsequent deferral elections with respect to deferrals in Plan Years beginning after the election is made, in accordance with the  Participant Election forms. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
 (b) Modification of Election. A distribution election with respect to previously deferred amounts may only be changed under the terms and conditions specified in Code Section 409A and this Section.  Except as permitted under Code Section 409A, no acceleration of a distribution is permitted. A subsequent election that delays payment or changes the form of payment for a Participant's Retirement Account or Scheduled Distribution Account shall be permitted if and only if all of the following requirements are met: 
 
 (1)the new election does not take effect until at least twelve (12) months after the date on which the new election is made; 
 
 (2)the new election delays payment for at least five (5) years from the date that payment would otherwise have been made, absent the new election; and 
 
 (3)in the case of payments made according to a Scheduled Distribution, the new election is made not less than twelve (12) months before the date on which payment would have been made (or, in the case of installment payments, the first installment payment would have been made) absent the new election. 
 
For purposes of application of the above change limitations, installment payments shall be treated as a single payment under Code Section 409A. Election changes made pursuant to this Section shall be made in accordance with rules established by the Committee and shall comply with all requirements of Code Section 409A and applicable authorities. 
 
 ARTICLE IV 
 ACCOUNTS 
 
 4.1 Deferral Accounts . The Committee shall establish and maintain up to six (6)  Deferral Accounts for each Participant under the Plan, of which one (1) shall be the Retirement Account. Each Participant's Deferral Accounts shall be further divided into separate  subaccounts (" Fund Subaccounts"), each of which corresponds to a Fund designated pursuant to Section 3.4. A Participant's Deferral Account shall be credited as follows: 
 
 (a)As soon as reasonably possible after amounts are withheld and deferred from a Participant's Compensation, the Committee shall credit the Fund Subaccounts of the Participant's Deferral Accounts with an amount equal to Compensation deferred by the Participant in accordance with the designation under Section 3.4; that is, the portion of the Participant's deferred Compensation designated to be deemed to be invested in a Fund shall be credited to the Fund Subaccount to be invested in that Fund; 
 
 (b)Each business day, each Fund Subaccount of a Participant's Deferral Accounts shall be credited with earnings or losses in an amount equal to that determined by multiplying the balance credited to such Fund Subaccount as of the prior day, less any distributions valued as of the end of the prior day, by the Interest Rate for the corresponding Fund as determine d by the Committee pursuant to Section 3.4(b); and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 (c)In the event that a Participant elects for a given Plan Year's deferral of Compensation to be allocated to one or more Scheduled Distribution Accounts, all amounts attributed to the deferral of Compensation for such Plan Year shall be accounted for in a manner which allows separate accounting for the deferral of Compensation and investment gains and losses a ssociated with amounts allocated to each such separate Scheduled Distribution Account. 
 
 4.2 Bank Contribution Account. The Committee shall establish and maintain a Bank Contribution Account for each Participant under the Plan. For purposes of a Participant's distribution elections, Bank Contributions shall be allocated to the Retirement Account and subject to distribution in the form applicable to such Retirement Account.

A Participant's Bank Contribution Account shall be credited as fo llows: 
 
 (a)As soon as reasonably possible after a Bank Contribution is made, the Bank shall credit the Fund Subaccounts of the Participant's Bank Contribution Account with an amount equal to the Bank Contributions, if any, made on behalf of that Participant, that is, the proportion of the Bank Contributions, if any, designated to be deemed to be invested in a certain F und shall be credited to the Fund Subaccount to be invested in that Fund; and 
 
 (b)Each business day, each Fund Subaccount of a Participant's Bank Contribution Account shall be credited with earnings or losses in an amount equal to that determined by multiplying the balance credited to such Fund Subaccount as of the prior day, less any distributions valued as of the end of the prior day, by the Interest Rate for the corresponding Fund as d etermined by the Committee pursuant to Section 3.4(b). 
 
 4.3 Trust; Funding. The Bank shall be responsible for the payment of all benefits under the Plan. At its discretion, the Bank may establish one or more grantor trusts for the purpose of providing for payment of benefits under the Plan.

Benefits paid to the Participant from any such trust or trusts shall be considered paid by the Bank for purposes of meeting the obligations of the Bank under the Plan. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Plan shall at all times be entirely unfunded for purposes of ERISA and the Code, and there shall be no requirement for the Bank to segregate assets of the Bank for payment of any amounts hereunder.

In addition,  following a Plan termination, Participant Account balances shall remain in the Plan and shall not be distributed until such amounts become eligible for distribution in accordance w ith the other applicable provisions of the Plan.

Â§1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix) or as otherwise permitted under Code Section 409A, the Bank may provide that upon termination of the Plan, all Account balances of the Participants shall be distributed, subject to and in accordance with any rules established by the Bank deemed necessary to co mply with the applicable requirements and limitations of Code Section 409A.
