 (3)                  CONVERSION OF NOTE .	This Note shall be convertible into shares of the Company's  Common  Stock, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 3. 
   
 (a)                     Conversion Right. Subject to the provisions of Section 3(c), at any time, the Holder shall be entitled to convert any portion of the outstanding and unpaid Conversion Amount (as defined below) int o fully paid and nonassessable shares of  Common Stock in accordance with Section 3(b), at the Conversion Price (as defined below). The number of shares of  Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any Conversion Amount pursuant to this Section 3(a) shall be equal to the quotient of dividing the Conversion Amount by the Conversion Price. The  Company shall not issue any fraction of a share of  Common Stock upon any conversion. If the issuance would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the Company shall round such fraction of a share of Common Stock up to the nearest whole share. The Company shall pay any and all transfer agent fees, legal fees, costs and any other fees or costs that may be incurred or charged in connection wi th the issuance of shares of the Company's  Common  Stock to the Holder arising out of or relating to the conversion of this Note. 
   
 (i)                     " Conversion Amount" means the portion of the Original Principal Amount and Interest to be converted, plus any penalties, redeemed or otherwise with respect to which this determination is being made. 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 (ii)                   " Conversion Price" shall equal 65% of the lowest closing price during the ten (10) consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the applicable Conversion Date  on which the Holder elects to convert all or part of this Note, subject to adjustment as provided in this Note. 
   
 (b) Mechanics of Conversion . 
   
 (i)                      Optional Conversion . To convert any Conversion Amount into shares of  Common  Stock on any date (a " Conversion Date"), the Holder shall (A) transmit by email, facsimile (or otherwise deliver), for receipt on or prior to 11:59 p.m., New York, NY Time, on such date, a copy of an executed notice o f conversion in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit A  (the " Conversion Notice") to the Company. On or before the third Business Day following the date of receipt of a Conversion Notice (the " Share Delivery Date "), the Company shall (A) if legends are not required to be placed on certificates of  Common Stock pursuant to the then existing provisions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Rule 144") and provided that the Transfer Agent is participating in the Depository Trust  Company's (" DTC ") Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, credit such aggregate number of shares of  Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled to the Holder's or its designee's balance account with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission system or (B) if the Transfer Agent is not participating in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, issue and deliver to the address as specified in the Conversion Notice, a certificate, registered in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled which certificates shall not bear any restrictive legends unless required pursuant the Rule 144. If this Note is physically surrendered for conversion and the outstanding Principal of this Note is greater than the Principal portion of the Conversion Amount being converted, then the Company shall, upon request of the Holder, as soon as practicable and in no event later than three (3) Business Days after receipt of this Note and at its own expense, issue and deliver to the holder a new Note representing the outstanding Principal not converted. The Person or Persons entitled to receive the sh ares of  Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of this Note shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of  Common  Stock upon the transmission of a Conversion Notice. 
   
 (ii)                    Company's Failure to Timely Convert. If within Three (3) Trading Days after the Company's receipt of the facsimile or email copy of a Conversion Notice the Company shall fail to issue and deliver to Holder via "DWAC /FAST" electronic transfer the number of shares of  Common  Stock to which the Holder is entitled upon such holder's conversion of any Conversion Amount (a " Conversion Failure"), the Original Principal Amount of the Note shall increase by $500 per day until the Company issues and delivers a certificate to the Holder or credit the Holder's balance accoun t with DTC for the number of shares of  Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled upon such holder's conversion of any Conversion Amount (under Holder's and Company's expectation that any damages will tack back to the Issua nce Date).  Company will not be subject to any penalties once its transfer agent processes the shares to the  DWAC  system. If the Company fails to deliver shares in accordance with the timeframe stated in this Section, resulting in a Conversion Failure, the Holder, at any time prior to selling all of those shares, may rescind any portion, in whole or in part, of that particular conversion attributable to the unsold shares and have the rescinded conversion amount returned to the Outstanding Balance with the rescinded conversion shares returned to the Company (under Holder's and Company's expectations that any returned conversion amounts will tack back to  the original date of the Note). 
   
 (iii)                   DWAC/FAST Eligibility.	If the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder the Shares by DWAC/FAST electronic transfer (such as by delivering a physical stock certificate), or if there is a Conversion Failure as defined in Section 3(b)(ii), and if the Holder incurs a Market Price Loss, then at any time subsequent to incurring the loss the Holder may provide the Company w ritten notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Market 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
Price Loss and the Company must make the Holder whole by either of the following options at Holder's election: 
   
Market Price Loss = [(High trade price for the period between the day of conversion and the day the shares clear in the Holder's brokerage account) x (Number of shares receivable from the conversion)] - [(Net Sales price realized by Holder) x (Number of shares receivable from the conversion)]. 
   
Option A - Pay Market Price Loss in Cash. The Company must pay the Market Price Loss by cash payment, and any such cash payment must be made by the third business day from the time  of the Holder's written notice to the Company. 
   
Option B - Add Market Price Loss to Outstanding Balance. The Company must pay the Market Price Loss by adding the Market Price Loss to the Outstanding Balance (under Holder's and t he Company's expectation that any Market Price Loss amounts will tack back to the Issuance Date). 
   
In the case that conversion shares are not deliverable by DWAC/FAST electronic transfer an additional 10% discount to the Conversion Price will apply. 
   
 (iv)                   DTC Eligibility. If the Company fails to maintain its status as "DTC Eligible" for any reason, the Principal Amount of the Note shall increase by ten thousand dollars ($10,000) (under Holder's and Company's expectation that any Principal Amount increase will tack back to the Issuance Date). In addition, the Conversion Price shall be permanently redefined to equal 50%  of the lowest traded price during the twenty-five (25) consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the applicable Conversion Date on which the Holder elects to convert all or part  of this Note, subject to adjustment as provided in this Note. 
   
 (v)                    Book-Entry. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of any portion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Company unless (A) the full Conversion Amount represented by this Note is being converted or (B) the Holder has provided the Company with prior written notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion Notice) requesting reissuance of this Note upon physical surrender of this Note. The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the Principal and Interest converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Company, so  as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon conversion. 
   
 (c) Limitations on Conversions  or  Trading . 
   
 (i)                      Beneficial Ownership. The Company shall not effect any conversions of this Note and the Holder shall not have the right to convert any portion of this Note  or  receive shares of  Common Stock as payment of interest hereunder to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion or receipt of such interest payment, the Holder, together with any affiliate thereof, would beneficially own (as determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder) in excess of 4.99% of the number of shares of  Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion or receipt of shares as payment of interest. Since the Holder will not be obligated to report to the Company t he number of shares of  Common Stock it may hold at the time of a conversion hereunder, unless the conversion at issue would result in the issuance  of  shares of  Common  Stock in excess of 4.99% of the then outstanding shares of  Common Stock without regard to any other shares which may be beneficially owned by the Holder or an affiliate thereof, the Holder shall have the authority and obligation to determine whether the restriction contained in this Section will limit any particular conversion hereunder and to the extent that the Holder determines that 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
the limitation contained in this Section applies, the determination of which portion of the principal amount of this Note is convertible shall be the responsibility and obligation of the Holder. If the Holder has delivered a Conversion Notice for a principal amount of this Note that, without regard to any other shares that the Holder or its affiliates may beneficially own, would result in the issuance in excess of the permitted amount hereunder, the Company shall notify the Holder of this fact and shall honor the conversion for the maximum principal amount permitted to be converted on such Conversion Date in accordance with Section 3(a) and, any principal amount tendered for conversion in excess of the permitted amount hereunder shall remain outstanding under this Note. "Market Capitalization" shall be defined as the product of (a) the closing price of the Common Stock of the Common stoc k multiplied by 
 (b) the number of shares of  Common Stock outstanding as reported on the Company's most recently filed Form 10-K or Form 10-Q. The provisions of this Section may be waived by Holder upon not less than  65  days prior written notification to the Company. 
   
 (ii)                    Capitalization.  So long as this as this Note is outstanding,  upon written request of the Holder, the Company shall furnish to the Holder the then-current number of common shares issued and outstanding, the then-current number of common shares au thorized, and the then-current number of shares reserved for third parties. 
   
 (d)   Other Provisions . 
   
 (i)                      Share Reservation. The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized Common Stock a number of shares equal to at least 3 (three) times the full number of shares of  Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding amounts under this Note; and within 3 (three) Business Days following the receipt by the Company of a Holder's notice that such m inimum number of shares of  Common  Stock is not so reserved, the Company shall promptly reserve a sufficient number of shares of  Common Stock to comply with such requirement. The Company will at all times reserve at least 17,000,000 shares of  Common  Stock for conversion. 
   
 (ii)                    Prepayment.  During the first six  months  this Note is in effect, the  Company   may  redeem this Note  by   paying  to the  Holder  an  amount  as  follows:  (i) if the  redemption  is prior to the  30th  day this Note is in effect (including the  30th  day), then for an  amount  equal to 110% of the  unpaid  principal amount  of  this Note along with any interest that has accrued during that period; (ii) if the  redemption  is on the  31st day  this Note is in effect, up to and including the  60th  day this Note is in effect, then for an  amount  equal to 115% of the unpaid principal  amount  of this Note along with  any accrued interest; (iii) if the redemption is on the 61st day this Note is in effect, up to and including the 120th day this Note is in effect, then for an  amount  equal to  130%  of the unpaid principal  amount  of this Note along with  any accrued interest; (iv) if the redemption is on the 121st day this Note is in effect, up to and including the  180th day this  Note is in effect, then for an  amount  equal to  150%  of the unpaid principal  amount  of this Note along with  any  accrued interest.  This  Note  may  not be  redeemed  after the  180th day  this Note is in effect.  The  redemption  must  be closed and paid for within 3 business days of the Company sending the redemption  demand  or the redemption will be invalid and the Company  may   not  redeem this Note. In the event the  Holder has delivered a Notice of Conversion to the Company prior to the receipt of a redemption notice from the Company, the Notice of Conversion shall prevail. 
   
 (iii)                  All calculations under this Section 3 shall be rounded up to the nearest $0.00001 or whole share. 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 (iv)                 Nothing herein shall limit a Holder's right to pursue actual damages or declare an Event of Default pursuant to Section 2 herein for the Company's failure to deliver certificates representing shares of Common Stock upon conversion within the period specified herein and such Holder shall have the right to pursue all remedies available to it at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief, in each case without the need to post a bond or provide other security. The exercise of any such rights shall not prohibit the Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under applicable law. 
   
 (4) REISSUANCE OF THIS NOTE . 
   
 (a)                     Assignability. The Company may not assign this Note. This Note will be binding upon the Company and its successors and will inure to the benefit of the Holder and its successors and assigns and  may be assigned by the Holder to anyone of its choosing without Company's approval. 
   
 (b)                    Lost, Stolen or Mutilated Note. Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Note, and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of any indemnification undertaking by the Holder to the Company in customary form and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of this Note, the Company  shall execute and deliver to the Holder a new Note representing the outstanding Principal. 
   
 (5)                  NOTICES. Any notices, consents, waivers or other communications required or permitted to be given under the terms hereof must be in writing and will be deemed to have been delivered: (i) upon receipt, when delivered personally; (ii) upon receipt, when sent by facsimile (provided confirmation of transmission is mechanically or electronically generated and kept on file by the sending party) (iii) upon receipt, when sent by email; or (iv) one (1) Trading Day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight delivery service, in each case properly addressed to the party to receive the same.

Written confirmation of receipt (i) given by the recipient of such notice, consent, waiver or other communication, (ii) mechanically or electronically generated by the sender's facsimile machine containing the time, date, recipient facsimile number and an image of the first page of such transmission or (iii) provided by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service, shall be rebuttable evidence of personal service, receipt by facsimile or receipt from a nationally recognized overnight delivery service in accordance with clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above, respectively.

 (6)                  APPLICABLE  LAW AND  VENUE. This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada, without giving effect to conflicts of laws thereof. Any action brought by either party against the other concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be brought only in the state courts of California or in the federal courts located in the city and county of San Diego, in the State of California. Both parties and the individuals signing this Agreement agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts. 
   
 (7)                  WAIVER. Any waiver by the Holder of a breach of any provision of this Note shall not operate as or be construed to be a waiver of any other breach of such provision or of any breach of any other provision of this Note. The failure of the Holder to insist upon strict adherence to any term of this Note on one or more occasions shall not be considered a waiver or deprive that party of the right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Note. Any waiver must be in writing. 
   
 (8)      LIQUIDATED DAMAGES. Holder and Company agree that in the event Company fails to comply with any of the terms or provisions of this Note, Holder's damages would be uncertain and difficult (if not impossible) to accurately estimate because of the parties' inability to predict future interest rates, future share prices, future trading volumes and other relevant factors. Accordingly, Holder and Company agree that any fees, balance adjustments, default interest or other charges assessed under this Note are not penalties but instead are intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, liquidated damages (under Holder's and Company's expectations that any such liquidated damages will tack back to the Closing Date for purposes of det ermining the holding period under Rule 144).
