The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined below) by the applicable Conversion Price then in effect on the date specified in the notice of conversion; provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted by facsimile or e-mail (or by other means resulting in, or reasonably expected to result in, notice) to the Company before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time on such conversion date (the " Conversion Date "). The term " Conversion Amount" means, with respect to any conversion of this Note, the sum of (1) the principal amount of this Note to be converted in such conversion plus (2) at the Holder's option, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such principal amount at the interest rates provided in this Note to the Conversion Date. 
   
 5.2           Mechanics and Effect of Conversion . 
   
(a)          No fractional shares will be issued upon conversion of this Note. In lieu of any fractional share to which the Holder would otherwise be entitled, the Company will pay to the Holder in cash the unconverted balance that would otherwise be converted into such fractional share. 
   
 (b)          In the event that this Note is converted in full pursuant to  Section 5.1 , the Holder shall surrender this Note, and the Notice of Conversion annexed hereto as  Exhibit A by e-mail or facsimile, duly endorsed (but without the requirement of a medallion signature guarantee), to the Company and the Note shall thereupon be canceled; provided that if this Note is converted only in part, then only the Notice of Conversion, duly endorsed (but without the requirement of a medallion signature guarantee), shall be required to be delivered by e-mail or facsimile to the Company. As soon as practicable following the Company's receipt of a Notice of Conversion and at its expense, but not later than ten business days after receipt of a Notice of Conversion, the Company will issue and deliver to the Holder, a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled upon conversion, together with (i) a check payable to the Holder for any cash amounts in lieu of fractional shares as described in clause (a) above and (ii) to the extent that the Holder has converted this Note only in part, a replacement Note in the form hereof in the principal amount equal to the remaining principal  balance of this Note (the " Replacement Note"). If permissible under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or if the Conversion Shares have been registered for re-sale, all shares shall be delivered without legend and if, the Company is so eligible, by electronic delivery to a brokerage account designated by Holder.

 5.4           Buy-In. In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if the Company fails to deliver to a Holder the Conversion Shares as required pursuant to this Note, and the Holder purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) shares of Common Stock (or a broker or trading counterparty through which the Holder has agreed to sell shares makes such purchase) to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by such Holder of the Conversion Shares which the Holder was entitled to receive from the Company (a " Buy-In"), then the Company shall pay in cash to the Holder (in addition to honoring its obligation to deliver to Holder a certificate or certificates representing the Conversion Shares and any remedies available to or elected by the Holder) the amount by which (A) the Holder's total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of common stock so purchased exceeds (B) the aggregate Conversion Price of the Conversion Shares required to have been delivered together with interest thereon at a rate of 5% per annum, accruing until such amount and any accrued interest thereon is paid in full (which amount shall be paid as liquidated damages and not as a penalty). For example, if a Holder purchases shares of Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to a Conversion Amount of $10,000 to have been received upon conversion of this Note, the Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000, plus interest. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect  of the Buy-In, along with the appropriate supporting documentation for such purchase.

(b)          This Warrant may be exercised for less than the full number of shares of Common Stock calculated above,  provided   that this Warrant may not be exercised in part for less than a whole number of shares of Common Stock. Upon any such partial exercise, the Company at its expense will forthwith issue to the Holder a new Warrant or Warrants of like tenor exercisable for the number of shares of Common Stock as to which rights have not been exercised (subject to adjustment as herei n provided), such Warrant or Warrants to be issued in the name of the Holder or its nominee. 
   
(c)         As soon as practicable after the exercise of this Warrant and in any event within ten (10) business days after the Exercise Price is paid as set forth above for an exercise for cash, the Company, at its expense, will cause to be issued in the name of and delivered to the Holder a certificate or certificates for the number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled upon such exercise, plus, in lieu of any fractional share to which the Holder  would otherwise be entitled, cash in an amount determined in accordance with  Section 3(d) hereof.

(d)         Prior to the exercise of this Warrant, the Holder shall not be entitled to any rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to shares for which this Warrant shall be exercisable, including, without limitation, the right to vote, to receive dividends or other distributions or to exercise any preemptive rights, and shall not be entitled to r eceive any notice of any proceedings of the Company. 
   
 
 
 14

The notice shall describe the material terms and conditions upon which the Company proposes to consummate such transaction. 
   
 3.             Adjustments . 
   
 (a)           Adjustments Generally. In order to prevent dilution of the rights granted hereunder in the specific circumstances contemplated by this  Section 3 , the Exercise Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in accordance with this  Section 3 . Upon each adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to  Section 3(b) and 3(c) (but not Section 3(d)), the Holder shall thereafter be entitled to acquire upon exercise, at the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment, the number of shares of Common Stock determined by (i) multiplying (A) the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment by (B) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise hereof immediately prior to such adjustment, and (ii) dividing the product thereof by the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment;  provided   that no such adjustments shall be made in the Exercise Price and/or the number of shares of Common Stock subject to this Warrant if the conversion ratio of the Common Stock already ref lects such event. 
   
 (b)           Subdivisions, Stock Dividends and Recapitalizations. In case the Company shall at any time subdivide its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares (including, without limitation, through any stock split effected by means of a dividend on the Common Stock which is payable in Common Stock), the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall be proportionately reduced, and, conversely, in case the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company shall be combined into a smaller number of shares, the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately increased, unless the conversion ratio of such Common Stock already reflects such event. 
   
 (c)           Reorganization, Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or Sale of Assets. If any capital reorganization or reclassification of the capital stock of the Company, or consolidation or merger of the Company with another corporation, or the sale of a significant amount of assets to another corporation shall be effected in such a way that (i) does not constitute a Change in Control, and (ii) holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities, cash or other property with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock, then, as a condition of such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale, lawful and adequate provision shall be made whereby the Holder shall have the right to acquire and receive upon exercise of this Warrant such shares of stock, securities, cash or other property of the successor corporation that a holder of the shares deliverable upon exercise of this Warrant would have been entitled to receive in such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale if this Warrant had been exercised immediately before such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger or sale. The foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, reclassifications, consolidations, mergers or sales and to the stock or securities of any other corporation that are at the time receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant. In all events, appropriate adjustments (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company) shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Warrant with respect to the rights and interests of the Holder after the transaction, to the end that the provisions of this Warrant shall be applicable after that event, as near as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares or other property deliverable after that event upon exercise of this Warrant. 
   
 
 
 15 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 (d)           Share Issuance. If, at any time after the date hereof while the Warrant is outstanding, the Company shall make a Dilutive Issuance (as defined below), for a price per share that is less than the Exercise Price that would be in effect at the time of such Dilutive Issuance, then, and thereafter successively upon each such Dilutive Issuance, the Exercise Price shall be reduced to the price per share in the Dilutive Issuance and if more than one Dilutive Issuance occurs while this Warrant is exercisable, the Exercise Price shall be reduced to the price per share in the Dilutive Issuance with the lowest price per share. In such event, the number of shares of Common Stock which may be acquired upon exercise of this Warrant shall not change. The reduction of the Exercise Price described in this paragraph is in addition to the other rights hereunder. 
   
 A " Dilutive Issuance" shall mean the issuance by the Company, other than an Excepted Issuance (as defined below) of any Common Stock, security or debt instrument carrying the right to convert such security or debt instrument into Common Stock, or of any warrant, right or option to purchase Common Stock with a purchase price, exercise price or conversion price less than the Exercise Price. A Dilutive Issuance for no consideration will be deemed issuable or to have been issued for $0.001 per share of Common Stock. 
   
 For purposes of this Warrant, " Excepted Issuance" shall mean (i) any issuance or sale by the Company of its securities as full or partial consideration in connection with a strategic merger, acquisition, consolidation or purchase of the securities or assets of a corporation or other entity (or any division or business unit thereof) so long as such issuances are not for the purpose of raising capital, (ii) any issuance of securities in connection with strategic supply, sale or license agreements and other partnering arrangements so long as such issuances are not for the purpose of raising capital, (iii) any issuance of securities upon the conversion or exercise of options or convertible securities issued on or prior to the date hereof, or (iv) any issuance of shares of Common Stock in connection with employee benefit plans and compensation related arrangements in the ordinary course and consistent with past practice approved by the Boa rd of Directors. 
   
 (e)           Fractional Shares. The Company shall not issue fractions of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant or scrip in lieu thereof. If any fraction of a share of Common Stock would, except f or the provisions of this  Section 3(e), be issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, then the Company shall in lieu thereof pay to the person entitled thereto an amount in cash equal to the current value of such fraction, calculated to the nearest one-hundredth (1/100) of a share, to be computed on the basis of the fair market value per share as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors o f the Company. 
   
 
 
 16 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 (e)           Certificate as to Adjustments . Whenever the Exercise Price shall be adjusted as provided in  Section 3 hereof, the Company shall promptly compute such adjustment and furnish to the Holder a certificate setting forth such adjustment and showing in reasonable detail the facts requiring such adjustment, the Exercise Price that will be effective after such adjustment and the number of shares and the amount, if any, of other property that at the time would be rec eived upon the exercise of this Warrant. 
   
 4.             Reservation of Stock Issuable on Exercise of Warrants. The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, solely for the issuance and delivery upon the exercise of this Warrant and other similar Warrants, such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as from time to time shall be issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant and other similar Warrants. All of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant and other similar Warrants, when issued and delivered in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, subject to no lien or other encumbrance other than restrictions on transfer arising under applicable securities  laws and restrictions imposed by  Section 6(a)  hereof and the Agreements to which reference is made in  Section 6(c)  hereof. 
   
 5.             Replacement of Warrant. Upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) upon delivery of an indemnity agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Company (with surety if reasonably required), or (in the case of mutilation) upon surrender and cancellation ther eof, the Company will issue, in lieu thereof, a new Warrant of like tenor and amount. 
   
 6.             Negotiability . This Warrant is issued upon the following terms:
