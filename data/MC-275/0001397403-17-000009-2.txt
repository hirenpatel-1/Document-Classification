 2.      Purchase Price . The " Purchase Price " for the Property shall be   Thirty-Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($38,500,000.00) . 
 3.      Payment of Purchase Price; Escrow Instructions .    The Purchase Price shall be paid to Seller by Buyer as follows: 
 A.      Deposit.    Within two (2) business days after the Effective Date, and as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of this Agreement, Buyer shall deliver to Escrow Company a certified o r cashier's check drawn on a national or state bank, or wire transfer, in the amount of   One Million and 00/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00), as partial payment and as an earnest money deposit (such deposit, together with the proceeds of the foregoing and the interest or income accrued on any of the foregoing, being he reinafter referred to collectively as the " Deposit"). If Buyer does not terminate this Agreement prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, then the Deposit shall become nonrefundable except (x) upon a Seller default or  (y) if an express condition to Buyer's performance under   Section 10  of this Agreement or elsewhere hereunder fails to occur and all applicable cure periods, if any, have expired. Any portion of the Deposit received or held by Escrow Company shall be held and applied in accordance with this Agreement. Upon the occurrence of the Closing (as that term is defined in   Section 6), the Deposit shall be applied against the Purchase Price. All interest and income thereon will be earned by Buyer while held by the Escrow Company and shall become part of the Deposit and shall be remitted to the party entitled to the Deposit pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer shall furnish its tax identification number to Escrow Company upon Escrow Company 's request therefor. 
 B.      Closing Payment.    Buyer shall deliver the balance of the Purchase Price, as adjusted by the prorations and credits specified herein, less the Deposit, to Escrow Company by wire transfer of immediately available federal funds on or before 10:00 a.m. Central time on the Closing Date (the amount to be paid under this   Section 3.B.   being called the " Closing Payment"). At Closing, Escrow Company shall deliver the Purchase Price, as adjusted by the prorations and credits specified herein (as approved by Seller and Buyer pursuant to a 
 
 
 3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
closing statement reflecting the financial provisions of the Closing, consistent with the provisions of this Agreement), to Seller in the manner directed by Seller. 
 C.      Escrow Instructions.    The parties shall deliver to Escrow Company an executed copy of this Agreement, which shall constitute joint primary instructions to Escrow Company to act in accordance with the provisions hereof; provided, however, that the parties shall execute such additional instructions as reasonably requested by Escrow Company not inconsistent with the provisions hereof. Escrow Company shall execute the signature page for Escrow Company attached hereto with respect to the provisions of this   Section 3; provided, however, that (a) Escrow Company's signature hereon shall not be a prerequisite to the binding nature of this Agreement on Buyer and Seller, and the same shall become fully effective upon execution by Buyer and Seller, and (b) the signature of Escrow Company will not be necessary to amend any provision of this Agreement. Escrow Company, as the person responsible for closing the transaction within the meaning of Section 6045(e)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " Code"), shall file all necessary information, reports, returns, and statements regarding the transaction required by the Code including, but not limited to, the tax reports required pu rsuant to Section 6045 of the Code. 
 D.      Investment of Deposit    . Any portion of the Deposit held by Escrow Company shall be so held in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including   Section 9  of this Agreement below). Escrow Company may, at Buyer's election, invest any portion of the Deposit while held by Escrow Company in FDIC insured accounts. 
 4.      Title 
 A.      Title Report; Survey.    If not previously ordered or delivered to Buyer, Seller shall order a commitment for an A.L.T.A. standard coverage owner's policy of title insurance for the Property from " Title Company " (as defined in   Section 6  of the Summary) and request that Title Company deliver the same, together with copies of all written title exceptions or encumbrances described therein (collectively, the " Title Report"), to Buyer. Buyer shall have until 5:00 p.m. Central time on the date that is ten (10) days before the expiration of the Due Diligence Period (the " Title Review Period ") to review the Title Report and any survey for the Property (" Survey ") that Buyer may elect to obtain. Buyer shall notify Seller in writing (the " Title Notice") prior to the expiration of the Title Review Period as to which matters within the Title Report and Survey, if any, are not acceptable to Buyer (individually, a " Disapproved Title Matter"). Any matter within the Title Report and any Survey matter which Buyer fails to disapprove prior to the expiration of the Title Review Period shall be conclusively deemed to have been approved by Buyer, provided, however, all Seller Mortgage Liens (as hereafter defined) are deemed disapproved. If Buyer timely delivers a Title Notice indicating a Disapproved Title Matter, then Seller shall have five (5) days after receipt of such Title Notice to elect to notify Buyer in writing (a " Title Response Notice") that Seller either (a) will in good faith attempt to remove such Disapproved Title Matter from title to the Property on or before the 
 
 
 4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Closing, or (b) elects not to cause such Disapproved Title Matter to be removed from title to the Property. If Seller fails to deliver a Title Response Notice as to a particular Disapproved Title Matter within such five (5) day period, then Seller shall be deemed to have made the election in clause (b) above as to such Disapproved Title Matter. The procurement by Seller of a written commitment from the Title Company to issue the "Owner's Policy" (defined below) or an endorsement thereto (at Seller's sole cost) reasonably satisfactory to Buyer as of the Closing and insuring Buyer against any Disapproved Title Matter shall be deemed a removal of such Disapproved Title Matter from title to the Property. If Seller makes (or is deemed to have made) the election in clause (b) above as to any Disapproved Title Matter, then Buyer shall have five (5) days following the earlier of (i) the date it receives the Title Response Notice making such election, or (ii) the date that Seller is deemed to have made such election as to such Disapproved Title Matter, within which to notify Seller in writing that Buyer elects to either (x) nevertheless proceed with the purchase and take title to the Property subject to such Disapproved Title Matter, or (y) terminate this Agreement. If Buyer makes the election set forth in clause (y) above, then this Agreement shall immediately terminate, the Deposit shall be promptly returned to Buyer, and Seller and Buyer shall have no further rights or obligations hereunder, except for the provisions hereof that expressly survive the termination of this Agreement. If Buyer fails to notify Seller in writing of its election within said five (5) day period, then Buyer shall be deemed to have made the election set forth in clause (x) above. The procedure set forth above shall apply to any additional title matter which is reflected upon any update of the Title Report or Survey delivered to Buyer but which was not originally reflected in suc h Title Report or Survey (" New Title Matter"), except that the Title Review Period for such New Title Matter shall be the five (5) day period after Buyer becomes aware of such New Title Matter (whether through an update of the Title Report or Survey, or otherwise), but in no event shall such review period extend beyond the Closing Date. 
 B.      Seller Mortgage Liens .    Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this   Section 4 , Seller shall be obligated to remove any " Seller Mortgage Liens" which, as used herein, means (a) any mortgage or deed of trust liens created or assumed by Seller that encumber the Real Property, (b) any judgment liens, mechanic's liens or personal property tax liens against or assumed by the Seller that encumber the Property and (c) any other monetary lien relating to Seller (other than liens for real estate taxes and assessments not yet due and payable) that encumbers the Property on or before the Closing Date. At Closing, Seller may direct Escrow Company to use the Purchase Price to effectuate  the release of all Seller Mortgage Liens. 
 C.      Exceptions to Title.    Buyer shall be obligated to approve title to the Property subject to the following exceptions to title (the " Permitted Exceptions "): 
 (a)    Real estate taxes and assessments not yet due and payable; 
 
 
 5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b)    The printed exceptions which appear in the A.L.T.A. standard coverage owner's policy of title insurance issued by Title Company in the State of Minnesota (not including any  exceptions on Schedule BII to the Title Report or Title Policy); 
(c)    Additional title matters first revealed after the expiration of the Title Review Period and not disapproved by Buyer as provided in   Section 4.A.   above; 
(d)    Any liens, encumbrances or other claims arising from due diligence reviews or inspections hereunder by Buyer or its agents, employees, contractors or consultants; and 
(e)    With the exception of Seller Mortgage Liens, which are deemed disapproved, such other exceptions to title or survey exceptions as may be approved or deemed approved by Buyer  pursuant to the above provisions of this   Section 4 . 
The Title Company's commitment to issue to Buyer (or its permitted assignee pursuant to the terms of this Agreement) the Owner's Policy (as defined below) on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be conclusive evidence of the ability of Seller to convey title to the Property to Buyer at the Closing subject only to the Permitted Exceptions. As used in this Agre ement, the term " Owner's Policy" means an owner's title insurance policy in the standard A.L.T.A. form issued in the State of Minnesota, in the face amount of the Purchase Price, showing (i) title to the Property to be vested of record in Buyer (or Buyer's Permitted Assignee pursuant to the terms of this Agreement), and (ii) the Permitted Exceptions to be the only exceptions to title. 
 D.      Endorsements to Owner's Policy.    It is understood that Buyer may request endorsements to the Owner's Policy. Buyer shall satisfy itself during the Due Diligence Period that the Title Company will be willing to issue such endorsements in connection with Owner's Policy at Closing. The issuance of any such endorsements shall be at Buyer's sole cost and expense and shall not be a condition to Closing, and in no event shall Seller be obligated to provide any indemnity, affidavit or other document in order to cause the Title Company to issue the Owner's Policy or any endorsements other than Title Company's customary owner's title affidavit as is required to remove exceptions for mechanics' liens and rights of parties in possession and other ite ms covered by Minnesota's Uniform Conveyancing Blanks seller affidavit (an " Owner's Affidavit "). 
 5.      Due Diligence Examination .    Except for title and survey matters (which shall be governed by the provisions of   Section 4  above), Buyer shall have the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending at 5:00 p.m. Central time on the date that is thirty (30) days thereafter (the " Due Diligence Period") within which to perform and complete all of Buyer's due diligence examinations, reviews, feasibility studies, and inspections of all matters pertaining to the purchase of the Property, including all agreements relating to the ownership, use or operation of the Property, and all physical, environmental and compliance matters and conditions respecting the P roperty and its future development. During the Due Diligence Period, Seller shall provide 
 
 
 6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Buyer with reasonable access to the Property upon two (2) business days' notice and shall also make available or deliver to Buyer (to the extent in Seller's actual possession) within five (5) business days after the Effective Date physical or electronic copies of the following documents relating to the Property and such other documents as Buyer shall reasonably request upon reasonable advance notice: all existing environmental reports, assessments and studies, all surveys and plats of the Property, plans, inspections (including, but not limited to, soil inspections and property inspections), engineering reports, structural reports, a complete list of the Personal Property, all contracts, grading plans, developm ent approvals and TIF documents (collectively, the " Property Documents"). In no event, however, shall Seller be obligated to make available any internal memoranda, correspondence or calculations of value, appraisals, or attorney-client privileged documents. Buyer shall promptly commence, and shall diligently pursue, its due diligence review hereunder. 
 A.      Review Standards. Buyer shall at all times conduct its due diligence review, inspections and examinations in a manner so as to not cause liability, damage, loss, cost or expense to Seller or the Property, and Buyer will indemnify, defend, and hold Seller and the Property harmless for, from and against any such liability, damage, loss, cost or expense to the extent caused by Buyer or its agents or consultants (the foregoing obligation surviving any termination of this Agreement), other than with respect to any conditions on or about the Property in existence as of the Effective Date. Without limitation of the foregoing, in no event shall Buyer make any intrusive physical testing (environmental, structural or otherwise) at the Property (such as soil borings, water samplings or the like) without Seller's express written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). Prior to the Closing, only after Seller's express specific written consent, given in Seller's sole and absolute discretion, shall Buyer be entitled to make applications to any applicable local, municipal, county, state, or federal agency for any change, authorization, or approval related to zoning, entitlements, or any other land use matter related to the Property whatsoever. Buyer will submit requests in writing to Seller for Seller's approval of such applications. In the event of any termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall return to Seller all Property Documents received from Seller or Seller's Broker. Buyer shall keep all information or data received or discovered in connection with any of the inspections, reviews or examinations strictly confidential unless and until the Closing occurs; provided, however, Buyer may, subject to Seller's right to seek a protective order or to quash a subpoena, produce such documents in response to due process of law. Prior to performing any inspection or test on the Property (other than an ALTA survey or a Phase I environmental inspection), Buyer shall deliver a certificate of insurance to Seller evidencing that Buyer or its contractors, agents and representatives have in place commercial general liability insurance in an amount of at least One Million and 00/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and workers compensation insurance if required by applicable law, and in at least the amounts required by applicable law, covering any accident arising in connection with the presence of Buyer, its contractors, agents and representatives on the Property, which insurance shall name Seller as an addit ional insured thereunder. 
 
 
 7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 B.      Due Diligence Termination Right.    If, on or before the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, based upon such review, examination or inspection, Buyer shall determine that it no longer intends to acquire the Property for any reason or no reason, in its sole discretion, then Buyer shall promptly (but in all events prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period) notify Seller of suc h determination in writing (such notice being herein called the " Due Diligence Termination Notice"), whereupon this Agreement, and the obligations of the parties hereunder, shall terminate, the Deposit shall be promptly returned to Buyer, and no party hereto shall have any further obligation in connection herewith except under those provisions that expressly survive a termination of this Agreement. In the event that Buyer fails to deliver the Due Diligence Termination Notice to Seller before the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed that the Property is acceptable to Buyer in all respects (s ubject to   Sections 4 ,   7   and   8  of this Agreement) and that it shall proceed with the acquisition of the Property, and the Deposit shall be non-refundable, pursuant to   Section 3.A.   of this Agreement. 
 C.      Financing Contingency. Seller and Buyer agree that Buyer may assume Seller's application to Federal National Mortgage Association (" FNMA") for a mortgage loan secured by the Property through Seller's Broker; provided, however, that (a) Buyer's obtaining of a mortgage loan from FNMA, or any other loan or acquisition financing, at or before the Closing shall not be a condition to Buyer's obligations hereunder, (b) there is no financing contingency for the benefit of Buyer under this Agreement, and (c) if this Agreement is terminated before the Closing, Seller and Buyer agree that Seller may re-assume the loan application to FNMA, and Seller will take all necessary steps, at Seller's sole cost and expense and specifically excluding payment of any fees or costs in connection with the loan application, to allow Seller to re-assume the FNMA loan appl ication, which obligation shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 
 D.      Service Contracts . As described in   Section 1  of this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Seller shall convey, in addition to the Real Property, the Intangible Property to Buyer, which Intangible Property (as defined in   Section 1  of this Agreement) includes, but is not limited to, Seller's right, title and interest in all service, maintenance or other operating agreements related to the Real Property, but specifically excluding all Terminable Contracts (as defined below) which will be terminated by Seller at or prior to Closing (collectively, the " Contracts "). All Contracts other than the Terminable Contracts are hereinafter referred to as an " Assigned Contract " and collectively, the " Assigned Contracts". Buyer may notify Seller in writing, prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, as to any Contract that Buyer elects not to assume (to the extent that assumption is app licable) on the Closing Date (the " Contract Rejection Notice ") and all Contracts rejected by Buyer in the Contract Rejection Notice shall be deemed to be " Terminable Contracts", and Seller shall give notice of termination of all such Terminable Contracts on or prior to the Closing Date and Seller will convey the Property free and clear of any Terminable Contracts, at no expense or liability to Buyer. Seller will indemnify, defend and hold Buyer harmless for, from and against any liability, damage, loss, lien, cost or expense in c onnection with obligations arising under any Terminable Contract, which obligation 
 
 
 8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
will survive the Closing. All Contracts not identified in the Contract Rejection Notice prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period shall be deemed to be Assigned Contracts and shall be expressly assumed by Buyer on the Closing Date pursuant to the Bill of Sale, Assignment and Assumption and Buyer shall be solely responsible for any fees, costs or expenses payable in connection with the assignment of the Assigned Contracts to Buyer at the Closing and as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller harmless for, from and against any liability, damage, loss, cost or expense in connection with post-closing obligations arising thereunder (the foregoing obligation surviving the Closing) . Seller agrees to terminate all management contracts prior to closing as Terminable Contracts. 
 (1)      Seller Exchange . Seller may desire to effectuate a tax-deferred exchange (also known as a "1031" exchange) (a " Seller Exchange") in connection with the purchase and sale of the Property. Buyer and Seller hereby agree to cooperate with each other in connection with a Seller Exchange, provided that: 
 (a)all documents executed by Buyer in connection with the Seller Exchange shall be subject to the prior reasonable approval of Buyer and shall recognize that Buyer is acting solely as an accommodating party to such Seller Exchange, Buyer shall have no liability with respect thereto, and is making no representation or warranty that the transactions qualify as a tax-free exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code or any applicable state or local laws and shall have no liability whatsoever if any such transactions fail to so q ualify; 
 (b)such Seller Exchange shall not result in Buyer incurring any additional costs or liabilities, and Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold Buyer harmless against any such additional  claims, causes of action, costs and liabilities; 
 (c)in no event shall Buyer be obligated to acquire any property or otherwise be obligated to take title, or appear in the records of title, to any property in connection with the Sell er Exchange; and 
 (d)in no event shall Seller's consummation of such Seller Exchange constitute a condition precedent to Seller's obligations under this Agreement, and Seller's failure or inability to consummate such Seller Exchange for any reason or for no reason at all shall not be deemed to excuse or release Seller from its obligations under this Agreement. 
 (2)      Buyer Exchange . Buyer may desire to effectuate a tax-deferred exchange (also known as a "1031" exchange) (a " Buyer Exchange") in connection with the purchase and sale of the Property. Buyer and Seller hereby agree to cooperate with each other in connection with a Buyer Exchange, provided that: 
 
 
 9

For purposes of this Agreement: (i) the term " Existing Leases" shall mean all leases, license agreements and other occupancy agreements in effect for space at the Property as of the Effective Date; (ii) the term " New Leases" shall mean any lease, license agreement or other occupancy agreement in effect for space at the Property entered into after the Effective Date; and (iii) the term " Lease " or " Leases" shall mean Existing Leases and New Leases collectively. During the period between the Effective Date and the Closing, Seller shall remain responsible for costs, obligations, and expenses that arise from or are required to be performed prior to the Closing by the terms of any of the Leases. During such period, Seller may also enter into New Leases and renewals, extensions, cancellations or other modifications to Leases and, in addition, Seller may enforce its remedies under any Lease in which the tenant is in default, all in the ordinary course of Seller's business as operated during Seller's ownership of the Property. During such period, if Seller shall agree to any free or discounted rent concessions in connection with any New Lease in excess of two free months for a 3 bedroom apartment Lease or one free month for a 1 bedroom apartment Lease (other than additional discounts of up to $250 for New Leases of low income housing units), Seller shall provide Buyer with a credit at Closing for the full value of such excess free or discounted rent. 
 4.      Disposition of Deposit 
 A.      Default by Seller. If the transaction herein provided shall not be closed by reason of Seller's default under this Agreement or the failure of satisfaction of the conditions benefiting Buyer under   Section 10.B.   hereof or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with   Sections 4 ,   5   or   7  hereof, then the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer, and neither party shall have any further obligation or liability to the other (subject to any provisions that expressly survive termination hereunder); provided, however, if Buyer shall have fully performed its material obligations hereunder and shall be ready, willing and able to close, and the transactions hereunder shall fail to close solely by reason of Seller's default, then as Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy Buyer may either (a) terminate this Agreement and receive a return of the Deposit, or (b) specifically enforce this Agreement as its sole and exclusive remedy; provided, however, that if specific enforcement is unavailable because Seller has sold the Property to another buyer, Buyer may terminate this Agreement and receive a return of the Deposit and recover its out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorne ys' fees), not to exceed 
 
 
 22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) in aggregate, in investigating the Property, negotiating this Agreement and preparing for Closing from the Seller. Any action taken to specifically enforce this Agreement must be brought by Buyer no later than the one hundred twentieth (120th) day following Seller's default, and Buyer's failure to commence such action within such one hundred twenty (120) day period shall be deemed an election by Buyer to elect to terminate this Agreement and receive a refund of the Deposit in accordance wi th subpart (a) above. 
 B.      Default by Buyer .    In the event the transactions herein provided shall not close for any reason other than the failure of satisfaction of the conditions benefiting Buyer under   Section 10.B.   of this Agreement or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with   Sections 4 ,   5,   7   or   8  of this Agreement or the default of Seller, then the amount of the Deposit that has actually been deposited with the Escrow Company (together with interest thereon) shall be delivered to Seller as full compensation and as liquidated damages under and in connection with this Agreement. In connection with the foregoing, the parties recognize that Seller will incur expense in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement and that the Property may be removed from the market; further, that it is extremely difficult and impracticable to ascertain the extent of detriment to Seller caused by the breach by Buyer under this Agreement and the failure of the consummation of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the amount of compensation Seller should receive as a result of Buyer's breach or default. In the event the sale of the Property shall not be consummated on account of Buyer's default, then the delivery to Seller and retention by Seller of the Deposit that has actually been deposited with the Escrow Company (together with interest thereon) shall be Seller's sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement by reason of such default, subject to the provisions of this Agreement that expressly survive a termination of this Agreement (including, and without limitation of, any indemnification obligations hereunder and Seller's right to recover fees and costs pursuant to   Section 11.E.  below). Except as provided herein, Seller waives all other claims, damages and remedies against Buyer in connection with such a default by Buyer under this Agreement. 
 5.      Conditions to Closing. 
 A.      Seller's Conditions to Closing.    In addition to the conditions provided in other provisions of this Agreement, Seller's obligations to perform its undertakings provided in this Agreement (including its obliga tion to sell the Property) are conditioned on the following: 
 (1)      Performance by Buyer. Due performance by Buyer of each and every undertaking and agreement to be performed by it hereunder (including the delivery to Escrow Company of the items specified to be delive red by Buyer in   Section 6  of this Agreement), and the material truth of each representation and warranty made by Buyer in this 
 
 
 23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Agreement at the time as of which the same is made and as of the Closing Date as if made on and as of the Closing Date; and 
 (2)      Governmental Approvals. Seller and Buyer shall have received the Governmental Approvals and the City and the Authority shall have executed and delivered the Assignment of Development Agreements. 
 B.      Buyer's Conditions to Closing.    In addition to the conditions provided in other provisions of this Agreement, Buyer's obligations to perform its undertakings provided in this Agreement (including its obligat ion to purchase the Property) are conditioned on the following (collectively, the " Buyer Closing Conditions "): 
 (1)      Performance by Seller    . The due performance by Seller of each and every undertaking and agreement to be performed by it hereunder; 
 (2)      Issuance of Owner's Policy.    The Title Company's irrevocable commitment to issue the Owner's Policy to Buyer at the Closing, in accordance with   Section 4   of this Agreement; 
 (3)      Governmental Approvals. Seller and Buyer shall have received the Governmental Approvals and the City and the Authority shall have executed and delivered the Assignment of Development Agreements. 
 6.      Miscellaneous 
 A.      Brokers. Buyer represents and warrants to Seller that no broker has represented Buyer in connection with the transaction contemplated under this Agreement.

Seller's Broker shall be compensated by Seller pursuant to the terms of a separate brokerage agreement, but only if the Closing occurs. In the event of a claim for broker's or finder's fee or commissions in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer from the same if it shall be based upon any statement or agreement alleged to have been made by Seller, and Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller from the same if it shall be based upon any statement or agreement alleged to have been made by Buyer. The parties' respective indemnification obligations under this   Section 11.A.  shall survive the closing of the transaction contemplated hereunder or the earlier termination of this Agreement. 
 B.      Limitations of Liability 
 (1)     No present or future direct or indirect partner, member, shareholder, director, officer, employee, advisor or agent of or in Seller (collectively, " Seller 
 
 
 24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Related Parties") shall have any personal liability, directly or indirectly, under or in connection with this Agreement or any agreement or instrument made or entered into under or in connection with the provisions of this Agreement, or any amendment or amendments to any of the foregoing made at any time or times, heretofore or hereafter, and Buyer and its successors and assigns and, without limitation, all other persons and entities, shall look solely to the assets and proceeds described in   Section 11.B.(2)  below for the payment of any claim or for any performance, and Buyer hereby waives any and all such personal liability. 
 (2)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or any of the documents executed by Seller in connection herewith, if the Closing of the transactions hereunder shall have occurred: (i) Seller's aggregate liability to Buyer for one or more breaches by Seller of any representations or warranties, indemnities or other obligations of Seller under this Agreement or any document executed by Seller in connection with this Agreement shall not exceed the lesser of (x) Buyer's actual, out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and (y) One Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($1,750,000.00); and (ii) in no event shall Seller be liable for any consequential, loss of business opportunity, special or punitive damages. Subject to the foregoing limitation, the obligations and liability of Seller under this Agreement shall be satisfied solely from the following: (a) the assets of Seller, as the case may be; and (b) the proceeds of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. In no event shall a negative capital account or contribution obligation of a direct or indirect shareholder, partner or member in Seller be deemed an asset of Seller for purposes of this Agreement. The limitations of liability cont ained in this   Section 11.B.   are in addition to, and not in limitation of, any limitation on liability provided in   Section 8   or   9   of this Agreement or by law or by any other contract, agreement or instrument. 
 C.      Successors and Assigns.

No transfer or assignment in vi olation of the provisions hereof shall be valid or enforceable. Subject to the foregoing, this 
 
 
 25

 2.    Transferor is the sole equity member of Seller; 
3.    Transferor is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Internal Revenue Code and Income Tax Regulat ions); 
2.    Transferor is not a disregarded entity as defined in Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii) of the Income Tax Regulations;
