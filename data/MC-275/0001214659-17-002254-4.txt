Merchant shall authorize FUNDER and/or  it's agent to deduct the amounts owed to FUNDER  for the Receipts as specified herein from settlement  amounts which would otherwise be due to Merchant  by permitting FUNDER to withdraw the specific  daily   amount   credited   against   the   specified  percentages by ACH debit of the Merchant account.  The authorization shall be irrevocable without the  written consent of FUNDER. 1.2 Term of Agreement.  This Agreement shall have   an indefinite term that shall last either until all the Merchant's   obligations  to   FUNDER   are   fully satisfied. This shall include but not be limited to any renewals, outstanding fees or costs. 1.3 Future Purchases.

IN  ARBITRATION, DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED  BY AN ARBITRATOR,  NOT  A JUDGE  OR  JURY.   ARBITRATION PROCEDURES ARE  SIMPLER AND MORE  LIMITED THAN IN  COURT.  THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION IS  GOVERNED  BY  THE  FEDERAL  ARBITRATION ACT (FAA), AND SHALL BE  INTERPRETED  IN  THE  BROADEST  WAY  THE LAW WILL ALLOW. Covered claims â€¢  You or we may arbitrate any claim, dispute or   controversy between you and us arising out of or related to your account, a previous related account or our relationship (called "Claims"). â€¢  If arbitration is chosen by any party, neither   you nor we will have the right to litigate that Claim in court or have a jury trial on that  Claim. â€¢  Except as stated below, all Claims are subject to   arbitration, no matter what legal theory they're based on or what remedy (damages, or injunctive  or declaratory relief) they seek, including Claims  based on contract, tort (including intentional tort),  fraud, agency, your or our negligence, statutory or  regulatory provisions, or any other sources of law;  Claims  made  as  counterclaims,  cross-claims,  third-party  claims,  interpleaders  or  otherwise;  Claims made regarding past, present, or future  conduct; and Claims made independently or with  other claims.  This also includes Claims made by  or against anyone connected with us or you or  claiming through us  or you,  or by  someone  making a claim through us or you, such as a co- applicant,   authorized  user,   employee,   agent,  representative  or an  affiliated/parent/subsidiary  company. Arbitration limits â€¢  Individual Claims filed in a small claims court are   not subject to arbitration, as long as the matter stays in small claims court. â€¢  We won't initiate arbitration to collect a debt from   you unless you choose to arbitrate or assert a Claim against us. If you assert a Claim against us, we can choose to arbitrate, including actions to collect a debt from you.  You may arbitrate on an individual  basis  Claims  brought  against  you, including Claims to collect a debt. â€¢  Claims brought as part of a class action, private   attorney general or other representative action can be arbitrated only on an individual basis.   The  arbitrator has no authority to arbitrate any claim  on a class or representative basis and may award  relief only on an individual basis. If arbitration is  chosen by any party, neither you nor we may  pursue a Claim as part of a class action or other  representative action. Claims of 2 or more persons  may not be combined in the same arbitration.  However,  applicants,  co-applicants,  authorized  users on a single account and/or related accounts,  or corporate affiliates are here considered as one  person. How arbitration works  CFN ACH 01-25-16   â€¢  Arbitration shall be conducted by the American   Arbitration Association ("AAA") according to this arbitration provision and the applicable AAA  arbitration rules in effect when the claim is filed  ("AAA Rules"), except where those rules conflict  with this arbitration provision.   You can obtain  copies of the AAA Rules at the AAA's website  (www.adr.org) or by calling 800-778-7879.  You  or we may choose to have a hearing, appear at any  hearing by phone  or other electronic  means,  and/or be represented by counsel.  Any in-person  hearing will be held in the same city as the U.S.  District Court closet to your billing address. â€¢  Arbitration may be requested any time,  even where there is a pending lawsuit, unless a trial has  begun or a final judgment entered.  Neither you  nor we waive the right to arbitrate by filing or  serving   a   complaint,   answer,   counterclaim,  motion,  or discovery in a court lawsuit.  To  choose arbitration, a party may file a motion to  compel arbitration in a pending matter and/or  commence arbitration by submitting the required  AAA forms and requisite filing fees to the AAA. â€¢  The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator in accord with this arbitration provision  and the AAA Rules, which may limit discovery.  The arbitrator shall not apply any federal or state  rules of civil procedure for discovery, but the  arbitrator   shall   honor   claims   of  privilege  recognized at law and shall take reasonable steps  to   protect   account   information   and   other  confidential   information   of  either   party   if  requested to do so.   The arbitrator shall apply  applicable substantive  law consistent with the  FAA and applicable statute of limitations, and  may  award  damages  or  other  relief  under  applicable law. â€¢  The arbitrator shall make any award in writing   and, if requested by you or us, may provide a brief statement of the reasons for the award.   An  arbitration  award  shall  decide the  rights  and obligations  only of the parties named  in the  arbitration, and shall not have any bearing on any other person or dispute. Paying for arbitration fees â€¢  We will pay your share of the  arbitration fee for an arbitration of Claims of $75,000 or  less if they are unrelated to debt collection.  Otherwise,  arbitration fees will be  allocated according to the  applicable AAA Rules.   If we prevail, we may not  recover  our  arbitration  fees,  unless  the  arbitrator  decides you Claim was frivolous.   All parties are  responsible for their own attorney's fees, expert fees  and any other expenses, unless the arbitrator awards  such fees or expenses to you or us based on applicable  law. The fmal award â€¢  Any award by an arbitrator is final unless a party   appeals it in writing to the AAA within 30 days of notice of the award.  The arbitration appeal shall  be determined by a panel of 3 arbitrators.   The  panel will consider all facts and legal issues anew  based on the same evidence presented in the prior  arbitration, and will make decisions based on a  majority vote.  Arbitration fees for the arbitration  appeal  shall  be  allocated  according  to  the  applicable AAA Rules.  An award by a panel on  appeal is final. A final award is subject to judicial  review as provided by applicable law. Survival and Severability of Terms â€¢  This arbitration provision shall survive changes in   this Agreement and termination of the account or the relationship between you and us, including the  bankruptcy of any party and any sale of your  account, or amounts owed on your account, to  another person or entity.   If any part of this  arbitration   provision   is   deemed   invalid   or  unenforceable, the other terms shall remain in Colonial Funding Network as Servicing Agent   force, except that there can be no arbitration of a  class or representative Claim.   This arbitration  provision  may  not  be  amended,  severed  or  waived, except as provided in this Agreement or  in a written agreement between you and us.  4.11 Counterparts; Facsimile and PDF Acceptance..
