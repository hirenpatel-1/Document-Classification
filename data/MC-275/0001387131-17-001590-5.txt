Upon receipt of such notice, the indemnifying party shall have the option of either assuming the defense of such action (and the cost thereof) with counsel reasonably satisfactory to both the indemnified and the indemnifying parties or participating in the defense of such action at the sole expense, however, of the indemnifying party. In the event of the indemnifying party's assumption of the defense of such action, counsel selected by the indemnified party may, at the election of the indemnified party, participate in any such defense, at the sole expense, however, of the indemnified party. No settlement or compromise to be paid by the indemnifying party shall be entered into without the written consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld.
