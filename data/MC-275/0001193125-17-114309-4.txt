 - 16 - 
 
 
and, without resistance or interference by the Grantors, take possession of the Collateral, (ii) dispose of any Collateral on any such premises, (iii) require the Grantors to assemble and make available to the Lender at the expense of the Grantors any Collateral at any place and time designated by the Lender which is reasonably convenient to both parties, (iv) remove any Collateral from any such premises for the purpose of effecting sale or other disposition thereof, (v) without demand and without advertisement, notice, hearing or process of law, all of which each of the Grantors hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by Law, at any place and time or times, sell, lease, assign, give option or options to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and deliver the Collateral or any part thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in one or more parcels any or all Collateral held by or for it at public or private sale (which in the case of a private sale of Pledged Equity, shall be to a restricted group of purchasers who will be obligated to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof), at any exchange or broker's board or elsewhere, by one or more contracts, in one or more parcels, for money, upon credit or otherwise, at such prices and upon such terms as the Lender deems advisable, in its sole discretion (subject to any and all mandatory legal requirements) and/or (vi) complete and tender each internet domain name transfer document in its own name, place and stead of the Grantor in order to effect the transfer of any internet domain name registration, either to the Lender or to another transferee, as the case may be and maintain, obtain access to, and continue to operate, in its own name or in the name, place and stead of such Grantor, such Grantor's internet website and the contents thereof, and all related advertising, linking and technology licensing and other contractual relationships, in each case in connection with the maintenance, preservation, operation, sale or other disposition of the Collateral or for any other purpose permitted under the Loan Documents or by applicable Law. Each Grantor acknowledges that any such private sale may be at prices and on terms less favorable to the seller than the prices and other terms which might have been obtained at a public sale and, notwithstanding the foregoing, agrees that such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and, in the case of a sale of Pledged Equity, that the Lender shall have no obligation to delay sale of any such securities for the period of time necessary to permit the Issuer of such securities to register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act of 1933. The Lender shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the whole or any part of the Collateral so sold. Neither the Lender's compliance with applicable Law nor its disclaimer of warranties relating to the Collateral shall be considered to adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale. To the extent the rights of notice cannot be legally waived hereunder, each Grantor agrees that any requirement of reasonable notice shall be met if such notice, specifying the place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made, is personally served on or mailed, postage prepaid, to the U.S. Borrower in accordance with the notice provisions of Section 10.02 of the Credit Agreement at least 10 days before the time of sale or other event giving rise to the requirement of such notice.

 - 17 - 
 
 
1933), or (B) made privately in the manner described above shall be deemed to involve a "public sale" under the UCC, notwithstanding that such sale may not constitute a "public offering" under the Securities Act of 1933, and the Lender may, in such event, bid for the purchase of such securities. The Lender shall not be obligated to make any sale or other disposition of the Collateral regardless of notice having been given. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, any Secured Party may be a purchaser at any such sale. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the Grantors hereby waives all of its rights of redemption with respect to any such sale. Subject to the provisions of applicable Law, the Lender may postpone or cause the postponement of the sale of all or any portion of the Collateral by announcement at the time and place of such sale, and such sale may, without further notice, to the extent permitted by Law, be made at the time and place to which the sale was postponed, or the Lender may further postpone such sale by announcement made at such time and place. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Grantor waives all claims, damages and demands it may acquire against the Lender or any Secured Party arising out of the exercise by them of any rights hereunder except to the extent any such claims, damages or demands result solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Lender or a ny other Secured Party as determined by a final  non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, in each case against whom such claim is asserted. Each Grantor agrees that the internet shall constitute a "place" for purposes of S ection  9-610(b) of the UCC and that any sale of Collateral to a licensor pursuant to the terms of a license agreement between such licensor and a Grantor is sufficient to constitute a commerciall y reasonable disposition (including as to method, terms, manner, and time) within the meaning of  Section 9-610  of the UCC.

(xvi)    do and perform all such other acts and things as the Lender may reasonably deem to be necessary, proper or convenient in connection with the Collateral. 
This power of attorney is a power coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable until the Facility Termination Date. The Lender shall be under no duty to exercise or withhold the exercise of any of the rights, powers, privileges and options expressly or implicitly granted to the Lender in this Agreement, and shall not be liable for any failure to do so or any delay in doing so. The Lender shall not be liable for any act or omission or for any error of judgment or any mistake of fact or law in its individual capacity or its capacit y as  attorney-in-fact except acts or omissions resulting from its gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final  non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. This power of attorney is conferred on the Lender solely to protect, preserve and realize upon its security interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon the Lender or any other Secured Party to exercise any such powers. 
 (b)     Assignment by the Lender. The Lender may from time to time assign the Secured Obligations to a successor Lender appointed in accordance with the Credit Agreement, and such successor shall be entitled to a ll of the rights and remedies of the Lender under this Agreement in relation thereto. 
 (c)     The Lender ' s Duty of Care. Other than the exercise of reasonable care to assure the safe custody of the Collateral while being held by the Lender hereunder, the Lender shall have no duty or liability to preserve rights pertaining thereto, it being understood and agreed that the Grantors shall be responsible for preservation of all rights in the Collateral, and the Lender shall be relieved of all responsibility for the Collateral upon surrendering it or tendering the surrender of it to the Grantors. The Lender shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which the 
   
 - 24 - 
 
 
Lender accords its own property, which shall be no less than the treatment employed by a reasonable and prudent agent in the industry, it being understood that the Lender shall not have responsibility for taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with respect to any of the Collateral. In the event of a public or private sale of Collateral pursuant to Section 7 hereof, the Lender shall have no responsibility for (i) ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relating to any Collateral, whether or not the Lender has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters, or (ii) taking any steps to clean, repair or otherwise pr epare the Collateral for sale. 
 (d)     Liability with Respect to Accounts. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each of the Grantors shall remain liable under each of the Accounts to observe and perform all the conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it thereunder, all in accordance with the terms of any agreement giving rise to each such Account. Neither the Lender nor any Secured Party shall have any obligation or liability under any Account (or any agreement giving rise thereto) by reason of or arising out of this Agreement or the receipt by the Lender or any Secured Party of any payment relating to such Account pursuant hereto, nor shall the Lender or any Secured Party be obligated in any manner to perform any of the obligations of a Grantor under or pursuant to any Account (or any agreement giving rise thereto), to make any payment, to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by it or as to the sufficiency of any performance by any party under any Account (or any agreement giving rise thereto), to present or file any claim, to take any action to enforce any performance or to collect the payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times. 
 (e)     Releases of Collateral . 
(i)     If any Collateral shall be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by any Grantor in a transaction permitted by the Credit Agreement, then the Lender, at the request and sole expense of such Grantor, shall promptly execute and deliver to such Grantor all releases and other documents, and take such other action, reasonably necessary for the release  of the Liens created hereby or by any other Collateral Document on such Collateral. 
(ii)     The Lender may release any of the Pledged Equity from this Agreement or may substitute any of the Pledged Equity for other Pledged Equity without altering, varying or diminishing in any way the force, effect, lien, pledge or security interest of this Agreement as to any Pledged Equity not expressly released or substituted, and this Agreement shall c ontinue as a first priority lien on all Pledged Equity not expressly released or substituted. 
 9.     Application of Proceeds. After the exercise of remedies provided for in Section 8.02 of the Credit Agreement (or after the Loans have automatically become immediately due and payable and the L/C Obligations have automatically been required to be Cash Collateralized as set forth in Section 8.02 of the Credit Agreement) any payments in respect of the Secured Obligations and any proceeds of the Collateral, when received by the Lender or any Secured Party in cash or Cash Equivalents will be applied in reduction of the Secured Obligations in the order set forth  in the Credit Agreement.

 10.     Continuing Agreement . 
(a)    This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until the Facility Termination Date, at which time this Agreement shall be automatically terminated (other than obligations under this Agreement which expressly survive such termination) and the Lender shall, upon the request and at the expense of the Grantors, forthwith release all of its liens and security interests hereunder and shall execute and deliver all UCC termination statements and/or other documents reasonably requested by the Grantors evidencing such termination. 
(b)    This Agreement shall continue to be effective or be automatically reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, in whole or in part, of any of the Secured Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Lender or any Secured Party as a preference, fraudulent conveyance or otherwise under any Debtor Relief Law, all a s though such payment had not been made;  provided that in the event payment of all or any part of the Secured Obligations is rescinded or must be restored or returned, all reasonable costs and expenses (including without limitation any reasonable legal fees and disbursements) incurred by the Lender or any Secured Party in defending and enforcing such reinstatement shall be deemed to be included as a part o f the Secured Obligations. 
 11.     Amendments; Waivers; Modifications, etc. This Agreement and the provisions hereof may not be amended, waived, modified, changed, discharged or terminated except as set forth in Section 10.01 of the Credit Agreement. 
 12.     Successors in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon each Grantor, its successors and assigns and shall inure, together with the rights and remedies of the Lender and the Secured Parties hereunder, to the benefit of the Lender and the Secured Parties and their successors and permitted assigns. 
 13.     Notices. All notices required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in conformance with Section 10.02 of the Credit Agreement;  provided that notices and communications to the Grantors shall be directed to the Grantors, at the address of the U.S. Borrower set forth in Section 10.02 of the Credit Agreement. 
 14.     Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which where so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. It shall not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement to produce or account for more than one such counterpart. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by fax transmission or other electronic mail transmission (e.g. "pdf" or "tif") shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent a manually executed counterpart is not specifically required to be delivered, upon the request of any party, such fax transmission or electronic mail transmission shall be promptly followed by such manually executed counterpart.

 16.     Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Venue; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. The terms of Sections 10.13 and 10.14 of the Credit Agreement with respect to governing law, submission to jurisdiction, venue and waiver of jury trial are incorporated herein by  reference,  mutatis mutandis , and the parties hereto agree to such terms. 
 17.     Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be fully severable and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect and shall be construed without giving effect to the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. 
 18.     Entirety. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the other documents relating to the Secured Obligations represent the entire agreement of the parties hereto and thereto, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, if any, including any commitment letters or correspondence relating to the Loan Documents, any other documents relating  to the Secured Obligations, or the transactions contemplated herein and therein. 
 19.     Other Security. To the extent that any of the Secured Obligations are now or hereafter secured by property other than the Collateral (including, without limitation, real property and securities owned by a Grantor), or by a guarantee, endorsement or property of any other Person, then the Lender shall have the right to proceed against such other property, guarantee or endorsement upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, and the Lender shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to determine which rights, security, liens, security interests or remedies the Lender shall at any time pursue, relinquish, subordinate, modify or take with respect thereto, without in any way modifying or affecting any of them or the Secured Obligations or any of the rights of the Lender or the Secured Parties under this Agreement, under any other of the Loan Documents or under any other document relating to the Secured Ob ligations. 
 20.     Joinder. At any time after the date of this Agreement, one or more additional Persons may become party hereto by executing and delivering to the Lender a Joinder Agreement in the form of  Exhibit B to the Credit Agreement or such other form acceptable to the Lender. Immediately upon such execution and delivery of such Joinder Agreement (and without any further action), each such additional Person will become a party to this Agreement as an "Grantor" and have all of the rights and obligations of a Grantor hereunder and this Agreement and the schedules  hereto shall be deemed amended by such Joinder Agreement. 
 21.     Consent of Issuers of Pledged Equity. Any Loan Party that is an Issuer hereby acknowledges, consents and agrees to the grant of the security interests in such Pledged Equity by the applicable Grantors pursuant to this Agreement, together with all rights accompanying such security interest as provided by this Agreement and applicable Law, notwithstanding any anti-assignment provisions in any operating agreement, limited partnership agreement or similar organizational or governance documents of such Issuer. 
   
 - 27 - 
 
 
 22.     Joint and Several Obligations of Grantors . 
(a)    Each of the Grantors is accepting joint and several liability hereunder in consideration of the financial accommodations to be provided by the Lender under the Credit Agreement, for the mutual benefit, directly and indirectly, of each of the Grantors and in consideration of the undertakings of each of the Grantors to accept joint and several liability  for the obligations of each of them. 
(b)    Each of the Grantors jointly and severally hereby irrevocably and unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety but also as a primary obligor, joint and several liability with the other Grantors with respect to the payment and performance of all of the Secured Obligations, it being the intention of the parties hereto that (i) all the Secured Obligations shall be the joint and several obligations of each of the Grantors without preferences or distinction among them and (ii) a separate action may be brought against each Grantor to enforce this Agreement whether or not the U.S. Borrower, any other Grantor or any other person or entity is joined as a party. 
(c)    Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, in any other of the Loan Documents, to the extent the obligations of a Grantor shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including, without limitation, because of any applicable state or federal law relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers) then the obligations of such Grantor hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount that is permissible under applicable law (whether federal or state and including, without limitation, Debtor  Relief Laws). 
 23.     Marshaling. The Lender shall not be required to marshal any present or future collateral security (including but not limited to the Collateral) for, or other assurances of payment of, the Secured Obligations or any of them or to resort to such collateral security or other assurances of payment in any particular order, and all of its rights and remedies hereunder and in respect of such collateral security and other assurances of payment shall be cumulative and in addition to all other rights and remedies, however existing or arising. To the extent that it lawfully may, each Grantor hereby agrees that it will not invoke any law relating to the marshaling of collateral which might cause delay in or impede the enforcement of the Lender's rights and remedies under this Agreement or under any other instrument creating or evidencing any of the Secured Obligations or under which any of the Secured Obligations is outstanding or by which any of the Secured Obligations is secured or payment thereof is otherwise assured, and, to the extent that it lawfully may, each Grantor hereby irre vocably waives the benefits of all such laws. 
 24.     Injunctive Relief . 
(a)     Each Grantor recognizes that, in the event such Grantor fails to perform, observe or discharge any of its obligations or liabilities under this Agreement or any other Loan  Document, any remedy of law may prove to be inadequate relief to the Lender and the 
   
 - 28 - 
 
 
other Secured Parties. Therefore, each Grantor agrees that the Lender and the other Secured Parties, at the option of the Lender and the other Secured Parties, shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief in any such case without the necessity of proving actual damages. 
(b)     The Lender, the other Secured Parties and each Grantor hereby agree that no such Person shall have a remedy of punitive or exemplary damages against any other party to a Loan Document and each such Person hereby waives any right or claim to punitive or exemplary damages that they may now have or may arise in the future in connection with any dispute under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, whether such dispute is resolved through arbitration or judicially.
