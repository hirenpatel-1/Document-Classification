 2.03.        Rights Retained by Debtor. So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and the Borrower has not received notice from the Administrative Agent terminating such rights, the Debtors shall be entitled (a) to receive and retain all revenues and other moneys pledged hereby as Collateral and the proceeds of any Disposition of any of its Properties constituting Collateral provided that such Disposition is permitted under the Credit Agreement, and (b) protect, enforce and exercise its rights under any contracts; provided that the Debtors shall not exercise nor shall any Debtor refrain from exercising any such right if such action or inaction, as applicable, would have a materially adverse effect on the value of the appl icable Collateral.

S o long as any property of a Debtor is excluded from the security interest granted in  Section 2.01 pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, such property shall be excluded from the term "Collateral" for all purposes hereunder. If the grant of a security interest in any lease, license, contract, property right or agreement existing on the date of this Agreement to which a Debtor is a party, or in any of its rights or interests thereunder, would constitute or result in the abandonment, termination pursuant to the terms of, or a breach or default under, any such lease, license, contract, property right or agreement (other than to the extent that any such term is rendered ineffective pursuant to Sections 9.406, 9.407, 9.408 or 9.409 of the UCC of any relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable Law (including any Debtor Relief Law) or principles of equity), such Debtor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remove such term from such lease, license, contract, property right or agreement at the time of the next amendment to, extension of or restatement of such lease, license, contract, property right or agreement.

Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of each Debtor (other than Borrower) hereunder shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of Title 11 of the United States C ode or any applicable provisions of comparable Law (collectively, the " Fraudulent Transfer Laws"), in each case after giving effect to all other liabilities of such Debtor, contingent or otherwise, that are relevant under the Fraudulent Transfer Laws (specifically excluding, however, any liabilities of such Debtor in respect of intercompany indebtedness to other Obligated Parties or Affiliates of other Obligated Parties to the extent that such indebtedness would be discharged in an amount equal to the amount paid or property conveyed by such Debtor under the Loan Documents) and after giving effect as assets, subject to  Section 6.01, to the value (as determined under the applicable provisions of the Fraudulent Transfer Laws) of any rights to subrogation or contribution of such Debtor pursuant to (a) applicable Law or (b) any agreement providing for an equitable allocation among such Debtor and other Obligated Parties of obligations arising under the Loan Documents and Bank Product Agre ements.

Such Debtor has neither entered into nor is it or any of its Property subject to any agreement limiting the ability of such Debtor to grant a Lien in any of the Collateral, or the ability of such Debtor to agree to grant or not grant a Lien in any of the Collateral. None of the Collateral is consigned goods, subject to any agreement of repurchase, or subject to any dispute, defense, or counterclaim. No effective financing statement or other similar effective document used to perfect and preserve a security interest or other Lien under the Laws of any jurisdiction covering all or any part of the Collateral is on file in any recording office, except such as may have been filed (i) pursuant to this Agreement or another Loan Document, or (ii) relating to Permitted Liens.

(k)       The parties acknowledge and agree that the Intellectual Property is the sole and exclusive property of each Debtor, subject to the terms and conditions stated in this Agreement. Other than in connection with any security interest in the Intellectual Property that a Debtor has granted to Administrative Agent, or any rights and remedies of Administrative Agent and Secured Parties under Laws, Administrative Agent shall not challenge such Debtor's ownership of the Intellectual Property.

In any country where sublicenses are incapable of registration or where registration of a sublicense will not satisfactorily protect the rights of each Debtor and Administrative Agent, Administrative Agent shall also have the right to designate other parties as direct licensees of such Debtor to use the Intellectual Property if an Event of Default exists and to enable such direct licensees to exercise any rights and remedies of Administrative Agent as such licensees reasonably deem necessary or appropriate and each Debtor agrees to enter into direct written licenses with the parties as designated on the same terms as would be applicable to a sublicense, and any such direct license may, depending on the relevant local requirements, be either (i)  in lieu of a sublicense or (ii) supplemental to a sublicense. In either case, the parties hereto shall cooperate to determine what shall be necessary or appropriate in the circumstances. For each sublicense to a sublicensee and direct license to a licensee, each Debtor appoints Administrative Agent its agent for the purpose of exercising quality control over the sublicensee. Each Debtor shall execute this Agreement and each other agreement necessary to effect the purposes of this Agreement in any form, content and language suitable for recordation, notice and/or registration in all available and appropriate agencies of foreign countries as Administrative Agent may reasonably require. 
   
(m)       In connection with the assignment or other transfer (in whole or in part) of its obligations to any other Person, Administrative Agent may assign the license granted herein without any Debtor's consent (other than any consent required by the Credit Agreement) and upon such assignment or transfer such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all rights and benefits in respect thereof granted to Administrative Agent under this Agreement (to the extent of such assignment or transfer). 
   
(n)       The parties hereto shall take reasonable action to preserve the confidentiality of the Intellectual Property;  provided, that Administrative Agent shall not have any liability to any Person for any disclosure of the Intellectual Property in connection with Administrative Agent's enforcement of its  rights under this Agreement or Laws.

As to any Pledged Equity Interests, no Debtor will consent to or approve of the issuance of (a) any additional shares or units of any class of Equity Interests of such issuer (unless, promptly upon issuance, additional Equity Interests are pledged and delivered to Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms hereof to the extent necessary to give Administrative Agent a security interest after such issuance in at least the same percentage of such issuer's outstanding Equity Interests as Administrative Agent had before such issuance), (b) any instrument convertible voluntarily by the holder thereof or automatically upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event or condition into, or exchangeable for, any Equity Interests, or (c) any warrants, options, contracts or other commitments entitling any third party to purchase or otherwise acquire any Equity Interests. 
   
 
 
 Security agreement-Page   21   
 
   
 
   
 4.09.        Waiver. To the extent not prohibited by applicable Laws or Permits, each Debtor agrees that any provision of any Constituent Document of any issuer of Collateral, any applicable Law, any certificate or instrument evidencing Collateral, or any other governance document that in any manner restricts, prohibits or provides conditions to (a) the grant of a Lien on any Equity Interest of such issuer or any other Collateral, (b) any transfer of any Equity Interest of such issuer or any other Collateral, (c) any change in management or control of such issuer or any other Collateral, (d) the admission of any transferee of any Collateral as a shareholder, member, partner or other equity holder of the issuer of such Collateral, or (e) any other exercise by Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party of any rights pursuant to this Agreement, any other Loan Document or Law, in each case shall not apply to (i) the grant of any Lien hereunder, (ii) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by such Debtor, (iii) the foreclosure or other realization upon any interest in any Collateral, or (iv) the exercise of rights with respect to such Collateral, including the right to participate in the management of such issuer. Furthermore, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Laws or Permits, no Debtor will permit any amendment to or restatement of any Constituent Document or any other governance document or enter into or permit to exist any agreement that in any manner adversely affects Administrative Agent's ability to foreclose on any Collateral or which conflicts with the provisions of this  Section 4.09 . 
   
 4.10.        Restrictions on Securities. No issuer of any Pledged Equity Interests which is either a partnership or limited liability company shall amend or restate its Constituent Documents (if its Constituent Documents do not provide that any Equity Interest in such issuer is a security governed by Chapter 8 of the UCC or that any Equity Interest in such issuer is evidenced by a certificate or other instrument) to provide that any Equity Interest in such issuer is a security governed by Chapter 8 of the UCC or permit any Equity Interest in such issuer to be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument. No certificate or other instrument evidencing or constituting any Pledged Equity Interest shall contain any restriction on transfer or other legend not reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent. With respect to each certificate that contains any such legend that is not reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent, each Debtor shall cause the issuer of each such certificate to issue one or more certificates in a form reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent. 
   
 4.11.        Rights to Dividends and Distributions. With respect to any certificates, bonds, or other Instruments or Securities constituting a part of the Collateral, Administrative Agent shall have authority, if an Event of Default exists, either to have the same registered in Administrative Agent's name or in the name of a nominee, and, with or without such registration, to demand of the issuer thereof, and to receive and receipt for, any and all dividends and distributions (including any stock or similar dividend or distribution) payable in respect thereof, whether they be ordinary or extraordinary. If any Debtor shall become entitled to receive or shall receive any interest in or certificate (including, without limitation, any interest in or certificate representing a dividend or a distribution in connection with any reclassification, increase, or reduction of capital, or issued in connection with any reorganization), or any option or rights arising from or relating to any of the Collateral, whether as an addition to, in substitution of, as a conversion of, or in exchange for any of the Collateral, or otherwise, such Debtor agrees to accept the same as Administrative Agent's agent and to hold the same in trust on behalf of and for the benefit of Administrative Agent, and to deliver the same immediately to Administrative Agent in the exact form received, with appropriate undated stock or similar powers, duly executed in blank, to be held by Administrative Agent, subject to the terms hereof, as Collateral. Unless an Event of Default exists or will result therefrom and subject to the other Loan Documents, such Debtor shall be entitled to receive all cash dividends and distributions not representing a return of capital or liquidating dividend paid or distributed with respect to the Securities, other than dividends or distributions or interests payable in Securities of the issuer of such Securities (which, if evidenced by certificated securities, shall be delivered to Administrative Agent as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, whether or not an Event of Default exists). Administrative Agent shall be entitled to all dividends and distributions, and to any sums paid upon or in respect of any Collateral, upon the liquidation, dissolution, or reorganization of the issuer thereof, which shall be paid to Administrative Agent to be held by it as additional collateral security for and application to the Obligations as provided in the Loan Documents. All dividends, distributions and Proceeds paid or distributed in respect of the Collateral which are received by any Debtor in violation of this Agreement shall, until paid or delivered to Administrative Agent, be held by such Debtor in trust as additional Collateral for the Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any failure of Administrative Agent to notify Debtor of any actions taken hereunder shall not affect the validity of such actions or any other rights and remedies of Administrative Agent or each Lender hereunder. 
   
 
 
 Security agreement-Page   22   
 
   
 
   
 4.12.        Right of Administrative Agent to Notify Issuers. If an Event of Default exists and at such other times as Administrative Agent is entitled to receive dividends, distributions and other property in respect of or consisting of any Collateral which is or represents a Security or an Equity Interest, Administrative Agent may notify issuers of such Security or Equity Interest to make payments of all dividends and distributions directly to Administrative Agent and Administrative Agent may take control of all Proceeds of any Securities and Equity Interests. Until Administrative Agent elects to exercise such rights, each Debtor, as agent of Administrative Agent, shall collect, segregate and hold in trust all dividends and other amounts paid or distributed with respe ct to Securities and Equity Interests.

 4.15.        Administrative Agent Appointed Attorney-in-Fact. Each Debtor hereby irrevocably appoints Administrative Agent such Debtor's attorney-in-fact, with full authority in the place and stead of such Debtor and in the name of such Debtor or otherwise to take any action and to execute any instrument which Administrative Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, including , without limitation ( provided , Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any such action or execute any instrument):

 ARTICLE V 
RIGHTS AND POWERS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. 
   
 5.01.        Administrative Agent May Perform. If any Debtor fails to perform any agreement contained herein, Administrative Agent may itself perform, or cause performance of, such agreement, and the expenses of Administrativ e Agent incurred in connection therewith shall be payable by Debtors under  Section 5.07 . 
   
 5.02.        Administrative Agent's Duties. The powers conferred on Administrative Agent hereunder are solely to protect Administrative Agent's and Secured Parties' interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. Except for the safe custody of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys actually received by Administrative Agent and Secured Parties hereunder, neither Administrative Agent nor any other Secured Party shall have any duty as to any Collateral, as to ascertaining or taking action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders, or other matters relative to any Collateral, whether or not Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters, or as to the taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining to any reasonable care in the custody and preservation of any Collateral in its possession if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that which Administrative Agent accords its own property. Excep t as provided in this  Section 5.02, neither Administrative Agent nor any other Secured Party shall have any duty or liability to protect or preserve any Collateral or to preserve rights pertaining thereto. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring or obligating Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party, and neither Administrative Agent nor any other Secured Party shall be required or obligated, to (a) present or file any claim or notice or take any action with respect to any Collateral or in connection therewith or (b) notify any Debtor  of any decline in the value of any Collateral. This  Section 5.02 shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and any satisfaction and discharge of each Debtor by virtue of any payment, court order, or Law. 
   
 5.03.        Events of Default. The occurrence of an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement shall constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement (each, an " Event of Default "). 
   
 
 
 Security agreement-Page   24   
 
   
 
   
 5.04.        Remedies . If an Event of Default exists: 
   
(a)       Administrative Agent may exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to it or any other Secured Party pursuant to any applicable Laws, all the rights and remedies of a secured party on default under the UCC (whether or not the UCC applies to the affected Collateral) and also may require each Debtor to, and each Debtor will at its expense and upon request of Administrative Agent forthwith, assemble all or part of the Collateral as directed by Administrative Agent and make it available to Administrative Agent at a place to be designated by Administrative Agent which is reasonably convenient to both parties for public or private sale, at any of Administrative Agent's offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery and upon such other terms as Administrative Agent may deem commercially reasonable. Each Debtor agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by Law, 10 days' notice to such Debtor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. Administrative Agent may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, withou t further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. 
   
(b)       All proceeds received by Administrative Agent upon any sale of, collection of, or other realization upon, all or any part of the Collateral shall be applied as set forth  in the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
   
(c)       All payments received by each Debtor under or in connection with any Collateral shall be received in trust for the benefit of Administrative Agent, shall be segregated from other funds of such Debtor, and shall be forthwith paid or delivered over to Administrative Agent in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement). 
   
 (d)       Because of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " Securities Act"), and other Laws, including without limitation state "blue sky" Laws, or contractual restrictions or agreements, there may be legal restrictions or limitations affecting Administrative Agent in any attempts to dispose of the Collateral and Administrative Agent's enforcement of its rights under this Agreement. For these reasons, Administrative Agent is authorized by each Debtor, but not obligated, if any Event of Default exists, to sell or otherwise dispose of any of the Collateral at private sale, subject to an investment letter, or in any other manner which will not require the Collateral, or any part thereof, to be registered in accordance with the Securities Act or any other Law. Administrative Agent is also hereby authorized by each Debtor, but not obligated, to take such actions, give such notices, obtain such consents, and do such other things as Administrative Agent may deem required or appropriate under the Securities Act or other securities Laws or other Laws or contractual restrictions or agreements in the event of a sale or disposition of any Collateral. Each Debtor understands that Administrative Agent may in its discretion approach a restricted number of potential purchasers and that a sale under such circumstances may yield a lower price for the Collateral than would otherwise be obtainable if the same were registered and/or sold in the open market. No sale so made in good faith by Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be not "commercially reasonable" because so made. Each Debtor agrees that if an Event of Default exists and Administrative Agent sells the Collateral or any portion thereof at any private sale or sales, Administrative Agent shall have the right to rely upon the advice and opinion of appraisers and other Persons, which appraisers and other Persons are acceptable to Administrative Agent, as to the best price reasonably obtainable upon such a private sale thereof. In the absence of fraud or gross negligence, such reliance shall be conclusive evidence that Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties handled such matter in a commercially reasonable manner under applicable Law. 
   
 
 
 Security agreement-Page   25
