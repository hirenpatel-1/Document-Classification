 EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT 
 
 This Executive Employment Agreement (" Agreement ") is entered into as of the 11th day of April, 2017 (" Effective Date "), between Samuel Montes (" Executive ") and IMH Financial Corporation (" Company "). Executive and the Company are each sometimes referred to individually in this Agreement as a " Party " and collectively as the " Parties ". 
 
 The Company desires to employ Executive; and 
 
Executive desires to be employed by the Company and provide services to the Company as its Chief Financial Officer (" CFO ") pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 
 
 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and other valid consideration the sufficiency of which is acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows: 
 
 1.     Employment; Devotion to Duties . 
 
 (a)     General. The Company will employ Executive as its CFO, and Executive accepts employment to serve in this capacity, all upon the terms and conditions in this Agreement. Executive will have those duties and responsibilities that are consistent with Executive's position as CFO, and other duties as may be assigned from time to time by the Company. 
 
 (b)     Devotion to Duties. During the Term, Executive (i) shall devote all of his business time and efforts to the performance of his duties on the Company's behalf, and (ii) shall not at any time or place or to any extent whatsoever, either directly or indirectly, without the express written consent of the Company, engage in any outside employment, or in any activity competitive with or adverse to the Company's business, practice or affairs, whether alone or as partner, manager, officer, director, employee, shareholder of any corporation or as a trustee, fiduciary, consultant or other representative. This is not intended to prohibit Executive from engaging in nonprofessional activities such as personal investments or conducting to a reasonable extent private business affairs which may include boards of directors' activity, as long as they do not conflict with the Company and, in the case of positions on boards of directors or similar bodies other than non-profit or not-for-profit boards, as long as Executive receives the prior written approval of the Company. Participation to a reasonable extent in civic, social or community activities is encouraged. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any non-Company activities shall be conducted in compliance with the Company's corporate governance policies and other policies and procedures as in effect from time to time.

 (e)     Change in Control . 
 
 (i)     Definition . For purposes of this Agreement, " Change in Control" means the occurrence of any one or more of the following events following the Effective Date with respect to the Company: 
 
 
 
 7 
 
 
 
 (1)    within a period of 12 months, any individual, entity or group (a " Person ") within the meaning of Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the " Act") (other than the Company, any corporation, partnership, trust or other entity controlled by the Company (a " Subsidiary"), or any trustee, fiduciary or other person or entity holding securities under any employee benefit plan or trust of the Company), together with all "affiliates" and "associates" (as such terms are defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Act) of such Person, becomes the "beneficial owner" (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Act) of securities of the Company representing 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities having the right to vote generally in an election of the Company's Board ( " Voting Securities"), other than as a result of (A) an acquisition of securities directly from the Company or any Subsidiary or (B) an acquisition by any corporation pursuant to a reorganization, co nsolidation or merger; or 
 
(2)    within a period of 12 months, the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, other than to a corporation, with respect to which following such sale, lease, exchange or other disposition (A) more than 50% of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of such corporation and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors is then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by all or substantially all of the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners of the outstanding Voting Securities immediately prior to such sale, lease, exchange or other disposition, (B) no Person (excluding the Company or any affiliate thereof and any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or any affiliate thereof, or a Subsidiary or such corporation or a subsidiary thereof and any Person beneficially owning, immediately prior to such sale, lease, exchange or other disposition, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the outstanding Voting Securities), beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of, respectively, the then outstanding shares of common stock of such corporation and the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities of such corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, and (C) subject to the nomination and approval of a full slate of directors to the Company's Board (including, without limitation, independent directors), at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of such corporation were members of the Company's Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement or action of the Company's Board providing for  such sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of assets of the Company. 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a "Change in Control" as to the Company will not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of this Agreement solely as the result of an acquisition of securities by the Company or any affiliate thereof in the Company which, by reducing the number of shares of Voting Securities outstanding, increases the proportionate voting power represented by the Voting Securities beneficially owned by any Person to 50% or more of the combined voting power of all then outstanding Voting Securities;   provided ,   however, that if any Person referred to in this sentence thereafter within a period of 12 months becomes the beneficial owner of any 
 
 
 8 
 
 
 
additional shares of Stock or other Voting Securities (other than pursuant to a stock split, stock dividend, or similar transaction), then a "Change in Control" as to the Company w ill be deemed to have occurred for purposes of this Agreement. 
 
 (ii)     Change in Control Payment/Section 280G Limitation . 
 
 (1)     General Rules. Code Sections 280G and 4999 may place significant tax burdens on both Executive and the Company if the total payments made to Executive due to certain change in control events de scribed in Code Section 280G (the " Total Change in Control Payments") equal or exceed the 280G Cap (three times the Executive's "Base Amount" as defined in Code Section 280G). If the Total Change in Control Payments equal or exceed the 280G Cap, S ection 4999 of the Code imposes a 20% excise tax (the " Excise Tax") on all amounts in excess of one times Executive's Base Period Income Amount. This Excise Tax is imposed on Executive, rather than the Company, and, to the extent required by applicable regulations, shall be withheld by the Company from any amounts payable to Executive pursuant to this Agreement. In determining whether the Total Change in Control Payments exceeds the 280G Cap and results in an Excise Tax becoming due, and for purposes of calculating the 280G Cap itself, the provisions of Code Sections 280G and 4999 and the applicabl e regulations control over the general provisions of this   Section 8(e)(ii) . 
 
 (2)     Limitation on Payments . Subject to the "best net" exception described in   Section 8(e)(ii)(3)  below, in order to avoid the imposition of the Excise Tax, the total payments to which Executive is entitled under this Agreement or otherwise will be reduced to the extent necessa ry to avoid exceeding the 280G Cap minus $1.00. 
 
 (3)     "Best Net" Exception. If Executive's Total Change in Control Payments minus the Excise Tax payable on all such payments exceeds the 280G Cap minus $1.00, then the total payments to which Executive is  entitled under this Agreement or otherwise will not be reduced pursuant to   Section 8(e)(ii)(2). If this "best net" exception applies, Executive shall be responsible for paying any Excise Tax (and income or other taxes) that may be imposed on Executive pursuant to Code Secti on 4999 or otherwise. 
 
 (4)     Calculating the 280G Cap . If the Company believes that the provisions of   Section 8(f)(ii)(2)  may apply to reduce the total payments to which Executive is entitled under this Agreement or otherwise, it shall notify Executive as soon as possible. The Company then shall engag e a " Consultant" (a law firm, a certified public accounting firm, and/or a firm of recognized executive compensation consultants) to make any necessary determinations and to perform any necessary  calculations required in order to implement the rules set forth in this   Section 8(e)(ii). The Consultant shall provide detailed supporting calculations to both the Company and Executive and all fees and expenses of the Consultant shall be borne by the Company. 
 
 
 
 9 
 
 
 
 If the Company determines that the limitations of this   Section 8(e)(ii)  apply, then pending the issuance of the opinions by the Consultant, then the total payments to which Executive is entitled under this Agreement or otherwise will be reduced to the extent necessary to eliminate the amount in excess of the 280G Cap. Such payments shall be made at the times specified herein, in the maximum amount that may be paid without exceeding the 280G Cap. The balance, if any, shall then be paid, if due, after the opinions called for by this   Section 8(e)(ii)(4)   have been received. 
 
If the amount paid to Executive by the Company is ultimately determined by the Internal Revenue Service to have exceeded the limitations of   Section 8(e)(ii)(2), Executive shall repay the excess promptly on demand of the Company. If it is ultimately determined by the Consultant or the Internal Revenue Service that a greater payment should have been made to Executive, the Company shall pay Executive the amount of the deficiency within 30 days of such determination. 
 
As a general rule, the Consultant's determination will be binding on Executive and the Company. Section 280G and the Excise Tax rules of Section 4999, however, are complex and uncertain and, as a result, the Internal Revenue Service may disagree with the Consultant's conclusions. If the Internal Revenue Service determines that the 280G Cap is actually lower than calculated by the Consultant, the 280G Cap will be recalculated by the Consultant. Any payment in excess of the revised 280G Cap then shall be repaid by Executive to the Company. If the Internal Revenue Service determines that the actual 280G Cap exceeds the amount calculated by the Consultant, the Company shall pay Executive any shortage. 
 
The Company has the right to challenge any determinations made by the Internal Revenue Service. If the Company agrees to indemnify Executive from any additional taxes, interest and penalties that may be imposed on Executive in connection with such challenge, then Executive shall cooperate fully with the Company. The Company will bear all costs associated with the challenge of any determination made by the Internal Revenue Service and the Company will control all such challenges. 
 
Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any claim or determination by the Internal Revenue Service that, if upheld, would result in the payment of Excise Taxes. Such notice shall be given as soon as possible but in no event later than 15 days following Executive's receipt of the notice of the Internal Revenue Service's position. 
 
 (5)     Effect of Repeal. If the provisions of Code Sections 280G and 4999 (or the corresponding provisions of any revenue law) are repealed without succession and with an effective date that is prior to  the application of this   Section 8(e)(ii) , then this   Section 8(e)(ii)   will not apply. If such provisions do not apply to Executive for whatever reason ( e.g. , because 
 
 
 10 
 
 
 
Executive is not a "disqualified individual" for purposes of Code Section 280G) or does not apply to this Agreement, then this   Section 8(e)(ii)   will not apply. 
 
 (f)     Leave of Absence. At the Company's sole discretion, Executive may be placed on a paid administrative leave of absence for a reasonable period of time should the Company believe it necessary for any reason, including, but not limited to confirm that reasonable grounds exist for a termination for Cause, for example, pending the outcome of any internal or other investigation or any criminal charges. During this leave, the Company may bar Executive's access to the Company's or any affiliate's offices or facilities or may provide Executive with access sub ject to terms and conditions as the Company chooses to impose. 
 
 (g)     Compliance with Code Section 409A . Any payment under this   Section 8   is subject to the provisions of this   Section 8(g)   (except for a payment pursuant to death under   Section 8(d)). If Executive is a "Specified Employee" of the Company for purposes of Code Section 409A at the time of a payment called for by   Section 8(b)  and if no exception from Code Section 409A applies in whole or in part, the severance or other payments shall be made to Executive by the Company on the first day of the seventh mo nth following the date of the Executive's Separation from Service (the " 409A Payment Date "). Should this   Section 8(g)  result in a delay of payments to Executive, the Company shall begin to make the payments as described in this   Section 8 , provided that any amounts that would have been payable earlier but for the application of this   Section 8(g), shall be paid in lump-sum on the 409A Payment Date along with accrued interest at the rate of interest announced by the Company's primary bank from time to time as its prime rate from the date that payments would otherwise have been made under this Agreement. The balance of the severance payments shall be payable in accordance with regular payroll timing. For purposes of this provision, the term Specified Employee has the meaning in Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), or any successor provision and the issued treasury regulations and rul ings. " Separation from Service " or " Termination of Employment" means, with respect to any payment that is subject to Code Section 409A, either (a) termination of Executive's employment with Company and all affiliates, or (b) a permanent reduction in the level of bona fide services Executive provides to Company and all affiliates to an amount that is 20% or less of the average level of bona fide services Executive provided to Company in the immediately preceding 36 months, with the level of bona fide service calculated in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(h)(1)(ii). Solely for purposes of determining whether Executive has a "Separation from Service," Executive's employment relationship is treated as continuing while Executive is on military leave, sick leave, or other bona fide leave of absence (if the period of such leave does not exceed six months, or if longer, so long as Executive's right to reemployment with Company or an affiliate is provided either by statute or contract). If Executive's period of leave exceeds six months and Executive's right to reemployment is not provided either by statute or by contract, the employment relationship is deemed to terminate on the first day immediately following the expiration of such six-month period. Whether a termination of employment has occurred will be determined based on all of the facts and circumstances and in accordance with regulations issued by the United States Treasury Department 
 
 
 11 
 
 
 
pursuant to Code Section 409A. If the payment is not subject to Code Section 409A, the term termination of employment will be given its ordinary meaning. 
 
 (h)     Mitigation. The Executive is under no obligation to seek other employment or to otherwise mitigate the obligations of the Company under this Agreement. 
 
 9.     Executive's Post-Termination Obligations . 
 
 (a)     Ownership of Work, Materials and Documents. The Executive shall disclose promptly to the Company any and all inventions, discoveries, and improvements (whether or not patentable or registrable under copyright or similar statutes), and all patentable or copyrightable works, initiated, conceived, discovered, reduced to practice, or made by him, either alone or in conjunction with others, during the Executive's employment with the Company and related to the business or activities of the Company and its affiliates (the " Developments"). Except to the extent any rights in any Developments constitute a work made for hire under the U.S. Copyright Act, which the parties acknowledge are owned by the Company and/or its applicable affiliate, the Executive assigns all of his right, title and interest in all Developments (including all intellectual property rights) to the Company or its nominee without further compensation, including all rights or benefits, including, without limitation, the right to sue and recover for past and future infringement. Whenever requested by the Company, the Executive shall execute any and all applications, assignments or other instruments which the Company deems necessary to apply for and obtain trademarks, patents or copyrights of the United States or any foreign country or otherwise protect its interests. These obligations continue beyond the end of the Executive's employment with the Company with respect to inventions, discoveries, improvements or copyrightable works initiated, conceived or made by the Executive while employed by the Company, and are binding upon the Executive's employers, assigns, executors, administrators and other legal representatives. If the Company is unable for any reason, after reasonable effort, to obtain the Executive 's signature on any document needed in connection with the actions described in this   Section 9(a), the Executive irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as the Executive's agent and attorney in fact to act for and in the Executive's behalf to execute, verify and file any such documents and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the purposes of this   Section 9(a)  with the same legal force and effect as if executed by the Executive. Immediately upon the Company's request at any time during or following the Term, Executive is required to return to the Company any and all Confidential and Proprietary Information and any other property of the Company then within Executive's possession, custody and/or control. Failure to return this property, whether during the term of this Agreement or after its termination, is a breach of this Agreement and will entitle the Company to offset its damages against a ny amounts owed to Executive. 
 
 (b)     Interests to be Protected. During the course of Executive's employment, Executive may be exposed to confidential and proprietary information, including, but not limited to, financial information, annual re ports, audited and unaudited financial reports, operational 
 
 
 12 
 
 
 
budgets and strategies, methods of operation, customer lists, strategic plans, business plans, marketing plans and strategies, new business strategies, merger and acquisition strategies, management systems programs, computer systems, personnel and compensation information and payroll data, and other such reports, documents or information (collectively the " Confidential and Proprietary Information"). Due to Executive's senior position with the Company and its affiliates, Executive acknowledges that he may receive Confidential and Proprietary Information with respect to the Company and/or its affiliates; for the avoidance of doubt, all such information is expressly included in the defined term "Confidential and Proprietary Information." If Executive's employment is terminated by either party for any reason, Executive promises that Executive shall not retain, take with Executive or make any copies of such Confidential and Proprietary Information in any form, format, or manner whatsoever (including paper, digital or other storage in any form) nor shall Executive disclose the same in whole or in part to any person or entity, in any manner either directly or indirectly except to the extent necessary to seek advice from Executive's legal counsel or accountants regarding Executive's compensation of any form or type. Excluded from this Agreement is information that (i) is or becomes publicly known through no violation of this Agreement; (ii) is lawfully received by the Executive from any third party without restriction on disclosure or use; (iii) is required to be disclosed by law, or (iv) is expressly approved in writing by the Company for release or other use by the Executive. Executive and the Company also acknowledge that because Executive is a senior executive he will have access to information (some of which is Confidential Information and some of which is not), employees and knowledge about the Company that is extremely valuable to the Company and which it needs to protect for a period of time after Executive terminates employment. Additionally, Executive and the Company agree that the covenants in this   Section 9  are reasonable and necessary to protect the Company's legitimate business interests. Executive and the Company agree that the following restrictive covenants (which together are referred to as the "Executive's Post-Termination Obligations") are fair and reasonable and are freely, voluntarily and knowingly entered into. Further, each party has been given the  opportunity to consult with legal counsel before entering into this Agreement. 
 
 (c)     Non-Solicitation of Current and Prospective Clients, Customers, Borrowers, and Vendors . During the Term and for a 12-month period after the termination of employment with the Company (" Period of Executive's Post-Termination Obligations"), regardless of who initiates the termination and for whatever reason, Executive shall not directly or indirectly, for Executive, or on behalf of, or in conjunction with, any other person(s), company, partnership, or corporation, in any manner whatsoever, call upon, contact, encourage, handle, accept, or solicit client(s), prospective clients, customers, prospective customers, borrowers, prospective borrowers, vendors, or prospective vendors of the Company with whom (i) Executive worked as an employee of the Company, or supervised other Company employee(s) who worked with such entities/persons, at any time prior to termination, or at the time of termination; and/or (ii) about whom Executive possessed or had access to Confidential and Proprietary Information at any time prior to termination, or at the time of termination, for the purpose of soliciting, providing, or selling to, or other wise interfering with the Company's business relationship or the Company's anticipated

business relationship with, such client(s), prospective client(s) customers, prospective customers, borrowers, prospective borrowers, vendors, or prospective vendors, any products and/or services that are the same, similar, or related to the business of the Company, or business that the Company has prepared, or offered to provide, to such client(s), prospective client(s) customers, prospective customers, borrowers, prospective borrowers, vendors, or prospective vendors. 
 
 (d)     Non-Solicitation of Employees.

For the purposes of this   Section 9(d) , " Company employee" means any individual who (i) is employed by or who works as a contractor for the Company at any time during the 12-month period preceding the termination of Executive's employment, or (ii) is employed by or who works as a contractor exclusively for the Company at any time during the Period of Executive's Post-Termination Obligations. 
 
 (e)     Competing Business. With respect to any property/facility owned (in whole or in part), operated, managed, and/or invested in (in whole or in part) by the Company, Executive shall not, during the Term and for the Period of Executive's Post-Termination Obligations, directly or indirectly, for Executive or on behalf of, or in conjunction with, any other person(s), company, partnership, or corporation, in any manner whatsoever, engage in the same or similar business as the Company which would be in competition with the Company within a 50-mile radius of any such property/facility owned (in whole or in part), operated, managed, and/or invested in (in whole or in part) by the Company during the 12-month period preceding the termination of Executive's employment and/or during the Period of Executive's Post-Termination Obligations. With respect to the Company's business of lending money, during the Term and for the Period of Executive's Post-Termination Obligations, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, for Executive, or on behalf of, or in conjunction with, any other person(s), company, partnership, or corporation, in any manner whatsoever, engage in the business of soliciting to lend money and/or lending money to any of the Company's customers (defined as any person or entity for whom the Company has loaned money, invested in, or otherwise established and/or maintained a business relationship within the 12 month period before the Effective Date, during the Term, and/or for the Period of Executive's Post-Terminations Obligations) or prospective customers (defined as any person or entity who has been solicited by the Company to become a customer during the 12 month period prior to Executive's termination of employment). 
 
 
 
 14 
 
 
 
 (f)     Extension of Period . Executive agrees that the Period of Executive's Post-Termination Obligations referred to in   Section 9(c), (d) and (e)  will be extended for a period of time equal to the duration of any breach of this Agreement by Executive. 
 
 (g)     Judicial Amendment . If the scope of any provision of   Section 9  of this Agreement is found by a court to be too broad to permit enforcement to its full extent, then that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law. The parties agree that, if legally permissible, the scope of any provision of this Agreement may be modified by a judge in any proceeding to enforce   Sections 9  of this Agreement, so that the provision can be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the parties agree that it will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement. 
 
 (h)     Injunctive Relief, Damages and Forfeiture. Due to the nature of Executive's position with the Company, and with full realization that a violation of   Section 9  may cause immediate and irreparable injury and damage, which is not readily measurable, and to protect the parties' interests, the parties understand and agree that either party may seek injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement in a court of competent jurisdiction to cease or prevent any actual or threatened violation of this Agreement. In any action brou ght pursuant to this   Section 9(h) , the prevailing party will be entitled to an award of attorney's fees and costs. 
 
 (i)     Survival . The provisions of this   Section 9   survive the termination of Executive's employment. 
 
 (j)     Cooperation; No Disparagement. During the Period of Executive's Post-Termination Obligations, Executive agrees to provide reasonable assistance to the Company (including assistance with litigation matters), upon the Company's request, concerning the Executive's previous employment responsibilities and functions with the Company. In consideration for this cooperation, Company will compensate Executive for the time Executive spends on such cooperative efforts (at an hourly rate based on Executive's Base Salary during the year preceding the date of termination) and Company will reimburse Executive for his reasonable out of pocket expenses Executive incurs in connection in such cooperative efforts. At all times after the Executive's employment with the Company has terminated, Company (defined for this purpose only as any Company press release and the Board, the CEO and the CEO's direct reports, human resources personnel and no other employees) and Executive agree to refrain from making any disparaging or derogatory remarks, statements and/or publications regarding the other, its employees, its se rvices or its business.

 15 
 
 
 
 (a)     Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable under any applicable law, then, if legally permissible, such provision will be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to render it legal, valid and enforceable, and if no modification will make the provision legal, valid and enforceable, then this Agreement will be construed as if not containing the provision held to be invalid, and the rights and obligations of the parties will be construed and enforced accordingly. 
 
 (b)     Assignment by Company. Nothing in this Agreement precludes the Company from consolidating or merging into or with, or transferring all or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation or entity that assumes this Agreement and all obligations and undertakings hereunder.
