Stock Options shall be subject to such terms and conditions, consistent with the other provisions of the Plan, as may be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. The Committee may vary, among Participants and among Stock Options granted to the same Participant, any and all of the terms and conditions of the Stock Options granted under the Plan.

 6   
 
 
   
 
 
   
 5.2           Stock Option Agreements.  Stock Options shall be evidenced by stock option agreements containing such terms and conditions, consistent with the provisions of the Plan, as the Committee shall from time to time determine. To the extent not covered by the stock option agreement, the terms and conditions of this Section 5 shall govern. 
   
 5.3           Stock Option Price.

The time and terms of payment may be amended with the consent of a Participant before or after exercise of a Stock Option. The Committee may from time to time authorize payment of all or a portion of the Stock Option price in the form of a promissory note or other deferred payment installments according to such terms as the Committee may approve. The Board may restrict or suspend the power of the Committee to pe rmit such loans and may require that adequate security be provided.

No Stock Option granted to any Participant who at the time of such grant owns, together with stock attributed to such Participant under Section 424(d) of the Code, more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may be designated as an incentive stock option, unless such Stock Option provides an exercise price equal to at least 110% of the Market Value of the Common Stock and the exercise of the Stock Option after the expiration of five years from the date of grant  of the Stock Option is prohibited by its terms. 
   
 5.6           Limits on Exercisability.  Except as provided in Section 5.5, Stock Options shall be exercisable for such periods, not to exceed 10 years from the date of grant, as may be fixed by the Committee. At the time of the exercise of a Stock Option, the holder of the Stock Option, if requested by the Committee, must represent to the Company that the shares are being acquired for investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof. The Committee may in its discretion require a Participant to continue the Participant's service with the Company and its Subsidiaries for a certain length of time prior to a Stock Option becoming exercisable and may eliminate such delayed vesting provisions.
