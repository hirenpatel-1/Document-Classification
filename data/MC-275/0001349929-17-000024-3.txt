 THIS LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT  (this "Agreement") is entered into on the above date (the "Effective Date") between PARTNERS FOR GROWTH IV, L.P. ("PFG"), whose address is 1660 Tiburon Blvd., Suite D, Tiburon, CA 94920 and Parent and Gentris (collectively, jointly and severally, "Borrower"), whose chief executive offices are located at the addresses set forth below their respective names above (with respect to each Borrower, such "Borrower's Address"). The Schedule to this Agreement (the "Schedule") being signed by the parties concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement is an integral part of this Agreement. Definitions of certain terms used in this Agreement are set forth in Section 7 below. 
 1.    THE LOAN. 
 1.1 The Loan.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on the Effective Date, PFG will make a loan to Borrower in the original principal amount set forth in Section 1 of the Schedu le (the "Loan"). 
 1.2 Interest.  The Loan and all other monetary Obligations shall bear interest at the rate(s) shown in the Schedule, except where otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement. Interest shall be due and payable monthly on the first day of each calendar month for interest accrued during the prior calendar month (or such other Billing Period and on the Maturity Date (or immediately upon acceleration of the Loan, if earlier). Interest payable from time to time on Loan principal will be determined by multiplying outstanding Loan principal by the per annum interest rate set forth in Section 2 of the Schedule and dividing such product by 360 to render a daily interest amount, which daily interest amount will be multiplied by the principal amount outstanding on actual number of days elapsed in each month (or other Billing Period) to derive the amount of interest due in such month (or other Billing Period In computing interest, (i) all payments received after 12:00 p.m. U.S. Pacific time on any day shall be deemed received at the opening of business on the next Business Day, and (ii) the date of the making of the Loan shall be included and the date of payment shall be excluded; provided, however, that if the Loan is repaid on the same day on which it is made, s uch day shall be included in computing interest on the Loan. 
 1.3 Fees.  Borrower shall pay PFG the Loan Fee shown on the Schedule, in addition to all Lender Expenses and all other fees and expenses payable to PFG under this Agreement or any other Loan  Documents, all of which are not refundable. 
 1.4 Loan Requests.  To make any request of PFG in relation to the Loan, Borrower shall make a Qualifying Request to PFG compliant with Section 8.5. Loan Requests are not deemed made until PFG acknowledges receipt of the same by electronic mail or otherwise in writing. Without limiting the effect of Section 8.22, each Borrower appoints the Responsible Officer(s) as its authorized agent to make Loan Requests and any Loan Request made by such Responsible Officer(s) shall be binding on each Borrower as if made by its own respective officers who are duly authorized to bind Borrower in respect of this Agreement. PFG's obligation to fund a Loan Request shall be subject to its receipt of such reports, certificates and other information as may be set forth in the Schedule. Loan Requests received after 12:00 Noon U.S. Pacific time on any Business Day will not be deemed to have been received by PFG until the next Business Day. PFG may rely on any Loan Request given by a person whom PFG believes in good faith is a Responsible Officer, and Borrower will indemnify PFG for any loss PFG suffers as a  result of that reliance. 
 1.5 Late Fee.  If any payment of interest or any other monetary Obligation is not received by PFG by the end of the third Business Day after the later of (i) the date for such payment to be received by PFG as reflected in any PFG invoice that may be sent from time to time to Borrower and (ii) such Obligation's Due Date, then upon each such failure to timely pay Borrower shall pay PFG a late payment fee equal to 5% of the amount of the payment due and not timely paid. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the imposition of any late payment fee and Borrower's payment thereof shall not be construed as PFG's waiver of Borrower's obligation to pay such amount or any other amount when due, and PFG's  acceptance 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of any late payment or late payment fee shall not restrict PFG's exercise of any remedies arising out of any such failure. Unless expressly waived in writing by PFG in its sole discretion, interest at the Default Rate shall apply to all monetary Obligations not timely paid from and including the date when Borrower's obligation to pay the aforementioned late  payment fee arises until the date of payment. 
 1.6 Invoicing . PFG will deliver invoices to Borrower (i) not later than the 25 th  day of each calendar month with respect to interest on the outstanding principal balance of the Loan due on the first day of the next succeeding calendar month, and (ii) not less than five (5) Business Days before the Due Date therefor with respect to other monetary Obligations; provided, however, the failure of PFG to send or Borrower to receive an invoice for payment of any monetary Obligations shall in no event excuse Borrower from its obligation to make such payment on the Due Date therefor. 
 2. SECURITY INTEREST. 
 2.1 Grant of Security Interest.  To secure the payment and performance of all of the Obligations when due, Borrower hereby grants to PFG a continuing security interest in and Lien upon, and pledges to PFG, all of the following (collectively, the "Collateral"): all right, title and interest of Borrower in and to all of the following, whether now owned or hereafter arising or acquired, and wherever located (collectively, the "Collateral"): all Accounts; all Inventory; all Equipment; all Collateral Accounts (including Deposit Accounts); all General Intangibles (including without limitation all Intellectual Property); all Investment Property; all Other Property; and any and all claims, rights and interests in any of the above, together with all guaranties and security for, all substitutions and replacements for, all additions, accessions, attachments, accessories, and improvements to, and all proceeds (including proceeds of any insurance policies, proceeds of proceeds and claims against third parties) of, any and all of the above, together with Borrower's books relating to any and all of the above. To the extent the Collateral includes Borrower's ownership interests in non-U.S. Subsidiaries, the grant of a security interest in such ownership interests shall be limited to 65% of the voting equity interests in such Persons. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Collateral shall not include (i) motor vehicles and similar assets the perfection of a security interest in which would be governed by state "Certificate of Title" laws by notating the security interest on the certificate of title, (ii) real property or interests therein, and (iii)  lease security deposits and the CD Accounts. 
 3. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF BORROWER. 
In order to induce PFG to enter into this Agreement, to make the Loan and to continue to grant credit accommodations to Borrower, Borrower represents and warrants to PFG, except to  the extent otherwise specified in   Exhibit A, as follows, and Borrower covenants that the following representations will continue to be true in all material respects (except for representations expressly made as of a particular date, in which case such representations will continue to be true as of said date), and that Borrower will at all times comply in all material respects with all of the following covenants, in each case throughout the term of this Agreement and thereafter until all Obligations have been paid and performed in full: 
 3.1 Corporate Existence, Authority and Consents.  Borrower is, and will continue to be, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation. All Governmental Authorizations required for Borrower to lawfully conduct its business as conducted on the Effective Date are in full force and effect except where the failure to maintain any such Governmental Authorizations in full force and effect would not result in a Material Adverse Change. The execution, delivery and performance by Borrower of this Agreement and all other Loan Documents (i) have been duly and validly authorized, (ii) are enforceable against Borrower in accordance with their respective terms (except as enforcement may be limited by equitable principles and by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Legal Requirements relating to creditors' rights generally), (iii) do not violate Borrower's Constitutional Documents, any Legal Requirement, or any material agreement or instrument binding upon Borrower or any of its material Collateral, and (iv) do not require any action by, filing, registration or qualification with, or Governmental Authorization from, any Governmental Body (except such Governmental Authorizations which have already been obtained and are in full force and effect), and (v) do not constitute grounds for acceleration of any material Indebtedness or obligation under any agreement or instrument of Borrower or relating to its property. Without limiting the foregoing: (A) the Board has the authority under Borrower's Constitutional Documents to enter into and cause Borrower to perform, or to delegate such authority to a Responsible Officer to enter into and cause Borrower to perform, its Obligations, and (B) other than the approval of the requisite members of the Board, no consent is required of any Person to make the representation set forth in clause (A) absolutely true in all respects. 
 3.2 Name; Trade Names and Styles.  As of the Effective Date, the names of Parent and Gentris set forth in the heading to this Agreement are their correct names as set forth in their respective Constitutional Documents. Listed in the Representations are all prior names of Borrower and all of Borrower's present and prior trade names as of the Effective Date. Borrower shall 
 
 
 
give PFG 30 days' prior written notice before changing its name or doing business under any other name. Borrower has complied, and will in the future comply, in all material respects, with all laws relating to the conduct of business under a fictitious business name, if applicable to Borrower. 
 3.3 Place of Business; Location of Collateral.  As of the Effective Date, the addresses set forth in the heading to this Agreement are the correct addresses of Parent's and Gentris's respective chief executive offices. In addition, as of the Effective Date, Borrower has places of business, and Collateral is located, only at the locations set forth in the Representations. Borrower will give PFG at least 30 days prior written notice before opening any additional place of business, changing its chief executive office, or moving any of the Collateral valued at greater than $25,000 to a location other than Borrower's Address or one of the locations set forth in the Representations, except that Borrower may maintain sales offices in the ordinary course of business  at which not more than a total of $10,000 fair market value of Equipment is located. 
 3.4 Title to Collateral; Perfection; Permitted Liens. 
(a)    Borrower is as of the Effective Date, and will at all times in the future be, the sole owner of all the Collateral, except for Collateral which is leased or licensed to Borrower. The Collateral is and will remain free and clear of any and all Liens except for Permitted Liens. Upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, PFG will have, and will continue to have, a First-Priority perfected and enforceable Lien upon all of the Collateral, subject only to Permitted Liens. Borrower will at all times defend PFG and  its interests in the Collateral against all claims of others. 
(b)    Borrower has set forth in the Representations all of Borrower's Collateral Accounts as of the Effective Date. Borrower shall (i) give PFG five (5) Business Days advance written notice before establishing any new Collateral Accounts or (ii) depositing any Cash or Cash Equivalents or Investment Property into any new Collateral Account and (iii) shall cause the institution where any such new Collateral Account is maintained to execute and deliver to PFG (or to the Senior Lender and PFG) a Control Agreement in form sufficient to perfect PFG's security interest in the Collateral Account and otherwise satisfactory to PFG in its good faith business judgment. 
(c)    In the event that Borrower shall at any time after the Effective Date acquire any commercial tort claims, which it is asserting, and in which the potential recovery exceeds $100,000, Borrower shall promptly notify PFG thereof in writing and provide PFG with such information regarding the same as PFG shall request (unless providing such information would waive Borrower's attorney-client privilege). Such notification to PFG shall constitute a grant of a security interest in the commercial tort claim and all proceeds thereof to PFG, subject only to Permitted Liens, and Borrower shall execute and deliver to PFG all instruments and agreements and take all such actions as PFG shall reasonably request in connec tion therewith. 
(d)     No Collateral with a value in excess of $250,000 is affixed to any real property in such a manner or with such intent as to become a fixture, except as disclosed in   Exhibit A. From and after the Effective Date, without PFG's consent in each instance, no material part of the Collateral will be affixed to any real property in such a manner, or with such intent, as to become a fixture, which consent may be conditioned on a grant to PFG of a Lien upon such fixture, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to PFG, subject to the  rights of the Senior Lender. Borrower is not, except as set forth in   Exhibit A, and will not become a lessee under any real property lease that prohibits, restrains, impairs or will prohibit, restrain or impair Borrower's right to remove any Collateral from the leased premises. Whenever any Collateral is located upon premises in which any third party has an interest, Borrower shall, whenever requested by PFG, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such third party to execute and deliver to PFG, in form reasonably acceptable to PFG, such waivers and subordinations as PFG shall specify in its good faith business judgment. Borrower will comply with all material terms of any lease of real property where any of the Collateral now or in the future may be located, except where the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to result in the termination of such lease or the impairment of Lender's Lien with respect to Collateral with a book value of $100,000 or  more. 
(e)    Except as specified in the Representations, Borrower is not party to, nor is it bound by, any Restricted License. 
 3.5 Maintenance of Collateral.  Borrower will maintain all material Collateral consisting of Equipment in good working condition (ordinary wear and tear excepted), and Borrower will not use the Collateral for any unlawful purpose. Borrower will promptly advise PFG in writing of any material loss or damage to the Collateral. 
 3.6 Books and Records.  Borrower will maintain at Borrower's Address books and records in accordance with GAAP that are true, correct and complete in all material respects. 
 3.7 Financial Condition, Statements and Reports.  All Financial Statements now or in the future delivered to PFG have been, and will be, prepared in conformity with GAAP and now and in the future will fairly present the results of  operations and 
 
 
 
financial condition of Borrower in all material respects, in accordance with GAAP, as of the dates and for the periods therein stated. Between the last date covered by any such sta tement provided to PFG and the Effective Date, there has been no Material Adverse Change. 
 3.8 Tax Returns and Payments; Pension Contributions.  Borrower has timely filed, and will timely file, all required Tax Returns, and Borrower has timely paid, and will timely pay, all Taxes now or in the future owed by Borrower, except to the extent such Taxes do not in the aggregate exceed $25,000. Borrower may, however, defer payment of any of the foregoing which are contested by Borrower in good faith, provided that Borrower (i) contests the same by appropriate proceedings promptly and diligently instituted and conducted, (ii) notifies PFG in writing of the commencement of, and any material development in, the proceedings, and (iii) posts bonds or takes any other steps required to keep the same from becoming a Lien upon any of the Collateral. Borrower is unaware of any claims or adjustments proposed for any of Borrower's prior tax years which could result in additional Taxes becoming due and payable by Borrower. Borrower has paid, and shall continue to pay, all amounts necessary to fund all present and future pension, profit sharing and deferred compensation plans in accordance with their terms, and Borrower has not and will not withdraw from participation in, permit partial or complete termination of, or permit the occurrence of any other event with respect to, any such plan which could reasonably be expected to result in any liability of Borrower, including any liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or its successors or any other Governmental Body. 
 3.9 Compliance with Law.  Borrower has, to its Knowledge, complied and will comply, in all material respects, with all provisions of all Legal Requirements applicable to Borrower, including, but not limited to, those relating to Borrower's ownership of real or personal property, the conduct and licensing of Borrower's business, and all environmental matters except where the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its business. None of Borrower's or any Subsidiaries' properties or assets has been used by Borrower or any Subsidiary or, to Borrower's Knowledge, by previous Persons, in disposing, producing, storing, treating or transporting any hazardous substance other than lawfully. Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries have obtained all consents, approvals and authorizations of, made all declarations or filings with, and given all notices to all Governmental Bodies that are necessary to conduct their respective business in a lawful manner and otherwise as currently conducted. 
 3.10 Litigation.   Except as set forth in   Exhibit A, there is no claim, suit, litigation, proceeding or investigation pending or (to Borrower's Knowledge) threatened in writing against or affecting Borrower in any court or before any Governmental Body (or to Borrower's Knowledge is there any basis therefor) (i) involving individually or in the aggregate more than $250,000, or (ii) which could reasonably be expected to result, either separately or in the aggregate, in any Material Adverse Change. Borrower will promptly inform PFG in writing of any claim, proceeding, litigation or investigation in the future threatened or instituted against Borrower involving more than, individually or in the aggregate, $100,000 or more. 
 3.11 Use of Proceeds.  Proceeds of the Loan shall be used solely for lawful business purposes, including general working capital purposes, and otherwise as detailed in the Schedule. Borrower is not purchasing or carrying any "margin stock" (as defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) and no part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used to purchase or carry any "margin stock" or to extend credit to others for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any "margin stock."

and the other Loan Documents, and (e) while any Obligations are outstanding, shall not Transfer any Intellectual Property with a value in excess of $25,000 without PFG's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld if no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, the Transfer of such Intellectual Property would not give rise to such a Default or Event of Default, and if such Intellectual Property meets the three criteria set forth as the exceptions to Borrower's duties to protect, defend and maintain under clause (a), above.

 3.14 Domain Rights and Related Matters. Borrower (a) is the sole record, legal and beneficial owner of all domain names and domain name rights used in connection with its business, free and clear of any rights or claims of any third party except Permitted Liens, and (b) the information set forth in the Representations with respect to domain names and ownership thereof the domain registry, domain servers, location and administrative contact information, web hosting and related services and facilities (collectively, "Domain Rights") is true, accurate and complete in all material respects.

The obligations of Borrower under this Section shall not be limited by any Borrower obligations under the IP Security Agreement and related Collateral Agr eements and Notices executed in connection with this Agreement. 
 4. ADDITIONAL DUTIES OF BORROWER. 
Borrower will at all times comply with all of the following covenants throughout the term of this Agreement: 
 4.1 Financial and Other Covenants.  Borrower shall at all times comply with the financial and other covenants set forth in the Schedule. 
 4.2. Remittance of Proceeds.  Subject to the rights of the Senior Lender and the holders of Permitted Liens contemplated within clause (i) of the definition thereof with priority over PFG's Liens, all proceeds arising from the disposition of any Collateral shall be delivered, in kind, by Borrower to PFG in the form in which received by Borrower not later than the following Business Day after receipt by Borrower, to be applied to the Obligations in such order as PFG shall determine; provided that, if no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower shall not be obligated to remit to PFG (i) the proceeds of Accounts arising in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) the proceeds of the sale of surplus, worn out or obsolete Equipment disposed of by Borrower in good faith in an arm's length transaction on fair and reasonable terms. Borrower agrees that it will not commingle proceeds of Collateral (other than those described in subclauses (i) and (ii) above) with any of Borrower's other funds or property, but will hold such proceeds separate and apart from such other funds and property and in trust for PFG, except as set forth above, and subject to the rights of the Senior Lender and the holders of Permitted Liens contemplated within clause (i) of the definition thereof with priority over PFG's Liens. Subject to the rights of the Senior Lender, PFG may, in its good faith business judgment, require that all proceeds of Collateral be deposited by Borrower into a lockbox account or such other "blocked account" as PFG may specify, pursuant to a blocked account agreement in such form as PFG may specify in its good faith business judgment. Nothing in this Section limits the restrictions on disposition of Collateral set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. 
 4.3 Insurance.  Borrower shall at all times insure all of the tangible personal property Collateral and carry such other business insurance, with insurers reasonably acceptable to PFG, in such form and amounts as are satisfactory to PFG and are customary and in accordance with standard practices for Borrower's industry and locations; and Borrower shall provide evidence of such insurance to PFG. All property and casualty insurance policies shall have a lender's loss payable endorsement showing PFG as a lender loss payee, and each liability insurance policy shall name PFG as an additional insured, in each as PFG's interests may appear. Upon receipt of the proceeds of any property and casualty insurance, subject to the rights of the Senior Lender, PFG shall apply such proceeds in reduction of the Obligations as PFG shall determine in its good faith business judgment, except that, provided no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, PFG shall release to Borrower insurance proceeds with respect to Collateral totaling less than $100,000, which shall be utilized by Borrower for the replacement of the Collateral with respect to which the insurance proceeds were paid. PFG may require reasonable assurance that the insurance proceeds so released will be so used. If Borrower fails to provide or pay for any insurance, PFG may, but is not obligated to, obtain the same at Borrower's expense. Borrower shall promptly deliver to PF G copies of all material reports made to insurance companies. 
 
 
 
 4.4 Reports.  Borrower, at its expense, shall provide PFG with the written reports set forth in the Schedule, and such other written reports with respect to Borrower (including budgets, projections, operating plans and other financial documentation), as PFG shall from time to time specify in its good faith business judgment. 
 4.5 Access to Collateral, Books and Records; Additional Reporting and Notices.  At reasonable times, on three (3) Business Days' notice, PFG, or its agents, shall have the right to inspect the Collateral, and the right to audit and copy Borrower's books and records. The foregoing inspections and audits shall be at Borrower's expense and the charge therefor shall be $850 per person per day (or such higher amount as shall represent PFG's then current standard charge for the same), plus Lender Expenses, provided that so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing and no prior inspection or audit has revealed material deficiencies or inaccuracies in Borrower's books and records, only one such inspection and audit shall be at Borrower's expense during any calendar year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall not be required to disclose to PFG any document or information (i) where disclosure is prohibited by applicable law, or (ii) is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege or constitutes attorney work product. If Borrower is withholding any information under the preceding sentence, it shall so advise P FG in writing, giving PFG a general description of the nature of the information withheld.

(i) acquire any material assets, except in the ordinary course of business, or make any Investments other than Permitted Investments; 
(ii) except as disclosed in SEC Filings made prior to the date hereof, directly or indirectly enter into or permit to exist any material transaction with any Affiliate of Borrower, except for transactions that are in the ordinary course of Borrower's business and upon fair and reasonable terms that are no less favorable to Borrower than would be obtained in an arm's length transaction with a non-affiliated Person, provided that upon not less than thirty (30) days' prior notice to PFG, one Borrower may merge with another Borrower and a Non-Borrower Subsidiary may merge with a Borrower or another Non-Borrower Subsidiary; provided, further, that the merger of Gentris and Parent shall require notice only upon compl etion;

(iv) store any Inventory or other Collateral with any warehouseman or other third party with an aggregate value (per location) of $25,000 or greater, unless there is in place a bailee agreement in such form as PFG shall specify in its good faith business judgment between PFG and such warehouseman or other third party;

(xi) engage, directly or indirectly, in any business other than the businesses currently engaged in by Borrower or reasonably related thereto;

PFG shall be free to employ other methods of noticing and selling the Collateral, in its discretion, if they are commercially reasonable. Borrower further acknowledges and agrees that if PFG's or 
 
 
 
third parties' access to Collateral is inhibited, restricted or denied, it shall be commercially reasonable for PFG to conduct a sale of Collateral under such circumstances even though the lack of access to Collateral would likely give rise to a sale price less than if parties had unfettered access to Collateral for purposes of conducting a sale. 
 6.4 Power of Attorney.  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, without limiting PFG's other rights and remedies, Borrower grants to PFG an irrevocable power of attorney coupled with an interest, authorizing and permitting PFG (acting through any of its employees, attorneys or agents) at any time, at its option, but without obligation, with or without notice to Borrower, and at Borrower's expense, to do any or all of the following, in Borrower's name or otherwise, but PFG agrees that if it exercises any right hereunder, it will do so in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner and the exercise of any rights will be subject to the rights of the Senior Lender and any other Permitted Lien: (a) execute on behalf of Borrower any documents that PFG may, in its good faith business judgment, deem advisable in order to perfect and maintain PFG's security interest in the Collateral, or in order to exercise a right of Borrower or PFG, or in order to fully consummate all the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, and all other Loan Documents; (b) execute on behalf of Borrower any invoices relating to any Account, any draft against any Account Debtor and any notice to any Account Debtor, any proof of claim in bankruptcy, any Notice of Lien, claim of mechanic's, materialman's or other Lien, or assignment or satisfaction of mechanic's, materialman's or other Lien; (c) take control in any manner of any cash or non-cash items of payment or proceeds of Collateral; endorse the name of Borrower upon any instruments, or documents, evidence of payment or Collateral that may come into PFG's possession; (d) endorse all checks and other forms of remittances received by PFG; (e) pay, contest or settle any Lien, charge, encumbrance, security interest and adverse claim in or to any of the Collateral, or any judgment based thereon, or otherwise take any action to terminate or discharge the same; (f) grant extensions of time to pay, compromise claims and settle Accounts and General Intangibles for less than face value and execute all releases and other documents in connection therewith; (g) pay any sums required on account of Borrower's Taxes or to secure the release of any Liens therefor, or both; (h) settle and adjust, and give releases of, any insurance claim that relates to any of the Collateral and obtain payment therefor; (i) instruct any third party having custody or control of any books or records belonging to, or relating to, Borrower to give PFG the same rights of access and other rights with respect thereto as PFG has under this Agreement; (j) execute on behalf of Borrower and file in Borrower's name such documents and instruments as may be necessary or appropriate to effect the Transfer of Domain Rights into the name of PFG or its designees, and (k) take any action or pay any sum required of Borrower pursuant to this Agreement and any other Loan Documents. Any and all Lender Expenses incurred by PFG with respect to the foregoing shall be added to and become part of the Obligations, shall be payable on demand, and shall bear interest at a rate equal to the Default Rate. In no event shall PFG's rights under the foregoing power of attorney or any of PFG's other rights under this Agreement be deemed to indicate that PFG is in control of the business, management or properties of Borrower. 
 6.5 Application of Proceeds.  All proceeds realized as the result of any sale of the Collateral shall be applied by PFG first to Lender Expenses incurred in the exercise of its rights under this Agreement, second to the interest due upon any of the Obligations, and third to the principal of the Obligations, in such order as PFG shall determine in its sole discretion. Any surplus shall be paid to Borrower or other persons legally entitled thereto and Borrower shall remain liable to PFG for any deficiency. If PFG, in its good faith business judgment, directly or indirectly enters into a deferred payment or other credit transaction with any purchaser at any sale of Collateral, PFG shall have the option, exercisable at any time, in its good faith business judgment, of either reducing the Obligations by the principal amount of purchase price or deferring the reduction of the Obligations until the actual receipt by PFG of  the cash therefor. 
 6.6 Remedies Cumulative.  In addition to the rights and remedies set forth in this Agreement, PFG shall have all the other rights and remedies accorded a secured party under the Code and under all other applicable laws, and under any other instrument or agreement now or in the future entered into between PFG and Borrower, and all of such rights and remedies are cumulative and none is exclusive. Exercise or partial exercise by PFG of one or more of its rights or remedies shall not be deemed an election, nor bar PFG from subsequent exercise or partial exercise of, any other rights or remedies. The failure or delay of PFG to exercise any rights or remedies shall not operate as a waiver thereof, but all rights and remedies shall continue in  full force and effect until all of the Obligations have been fully paid and performed.

Any claim or cause of action by Borrower against PFG, its directors, officers, employees, agents, accountants or attorneys, based upon, arising from, or relating to this Loan Agreement, or any other Loan Document, or any other transaction contemplated hereby or thereby or relating hereto or thereto, or any other matter, cause or thing whatsoever, incurred, done, omitted or suffered to be done by PFG, its directors, officers, employees, agents, accountants or attorneys, shall be barred unless asserted by Borrower by the commencement of an action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction by (a) the filing of a complaint within one year after the earlier to occur of (i) the first act, occurrence or omission upon which such claim or cause of action, or any part thereof, is based, or (ii) the date this Agreement is terminated, and (b) the service of a summons and complaint on an officer of PFG, or on any other person authorized to accept service on behalf of PFG, within thirty (30) days thereafter. Borrower agrees that such one-year period is a reasonable and sufficient time for Borrower to investigate and act upon any such claim or cause of action. The one-year period provided herein shall not be waived, tolled, or extended except by the written consent of PFG in its sole discretion. This provision shall survive any termination of this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document. 
 8.17 Loan Monitoring.  At reasonable times and upon reasonable advance notice to Borrower, PFG shall have the right to visit personally with Borrower up to two times per calendar year at its principal place of business or such other location as the parties may mutually agree, for the purpose of meeting with Borrower's management in order to remain as up-to-date with Borrower's business as is practicable and to maintain best practices in terms of lender loan monitoring and diligence. Lender Expenses incurred for reasonable travel, lodging and similar expenses for up to two PFG staff for such visits shall be at Borrower's expense and reimbursed in the same manner as other PFG expenses under this Agreement. 
 8.18     Paragraph Headings; Construction; Counterparts.  Paragraph headings are only used in this Agreement for convenience. Borrower and PFG acknowledge that the headings may not describe completely the subject matter of the applicable paragraph, and the headings shall not be used in any manner to construe, limit, define or interpret any term or provision of this Agreement. This Agreement has been fully reviewed and negotiated between the parties with the benefit of independent counsel and no uncertainty or ambiguity in any term or provision of this Agreement shall be construed strictly against PFG or Borrower under any rule of construction or otherwise. References to "Borrower" are construed to mean "each Borrower", unless otherwise expressly specified. Amounts set off in brackets or parentheses are negative. The word "shall" is mandatory, the word "may" is permissive, and the word "or" is not exclusive. The term "Agreement" includes the Schedule and (if not otherwise specified) any amendment, modification, restatement or other writing amending the terms of this Agreement. Obligations of a similar nature addressed in different sections of this Agreement shall be deemed supplemental to one another and not exclusive unless expressly set forth as such. Words and phrases expressing examples, including "for example" and "such as" are non-exclusive. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties on separate counterparts, each of which, wh en executed and delivered, is an original, and all taken together, constitute one Agreement. 
 8.19 Correction of Loan Documents.  PFG may correct patent errors and fill in any blanks in the Loan Documents consistent with the agreement of the parties so long as PFG provides Borrowers with written notice of such correction and allows Borrower at least ten (10) days to object to such correction. In the event of such objection, such correction shall not be made except by an amendment signe d by both PFG and Borrower. 
 8.20 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Venue.  This Agreement and all acts and transactions hereunder and all rights and obligations of PFG and Borrower shall be governed by the laws of the State of California. As a material part of the consideration to PFG to enter into this Agreement, Borrower (i) agrees that all actions and proceedings relating directly or indirectly to this 
 
 
 
Agreement shall be litigated in courts located within California and that the exclusive venue therefor shall, at PFG's option, be Santa Clara County; (ii) consents to the jurisdiction and venue of any such court and consents to service of process in any such action or proceeding by personal delivery or by internationally-recognized commercial courier or overnight delivery service or by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address for Borrower; and (iii) waives any and all rights Borrower may have to object to the jurisdiction of any such court, or to transfer or change the venue of any such action or proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PFG, in pursuit of collection and Collateral or rights therein, may pursue remedies in any jurisdiction in which Borrower or any Collateral resides or is deemed to reside. 
 
 8.21   Withholding. Payments received by PFG from Borrower under this Agreement will be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, deductions, withholdings, assessments, fees or other charges imposed by any Governmental Body (including any interest, additions to tax or penalties applicable thereto). Specifically, however, if at any time any Governmental Body, applicable law, regulation or international agreement requires Borrower to make any withholding or deduction from any such payment or other sum payable hereunder to PFG, Borrower hereby covenants and agrees that the amount due from Borrower with respect to such payment or other sum payable hereunder will be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of such required withholding or deduction, PFG receives a net sum equal to the sum which it would have received had no withholding or deduction been required, and Borrower shall pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Body. Borrower will, upon request, furnish PFG with proof reasonably satisfactory to PFG indicating that Borrower has made such withholding payment; provided, however, that Borrower need not make any withholding payment if the amount or validity of such withholding payment is contested in good faith by appropriate and timely proceedings and as to which payment in full is bonded or reserved against by Borrower. The agreements and obligations of Borrower contained in this Section 8.21 shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 
 
 8.22 Multiple Borrowers; Suretyship Waivers.   If there is at any time after the Effective Date more than one Borrower: 
 (a)   Borrowers' Agent. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints each other Borrower, as the agent, attorney-in-fact and legal representative of all Borrowers for all purposes, including requesting disbursement of the Loan and receiving account statements and other notices and communications to Borrowers (or any of them) from PFG. PFG may rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, on any request in relation to the Loan, disbursement instruction, report, information or any other notice or communication made or given by any Borrower, whether in its own name, as Borrowers' agent, or on behalf of one or more Borrowers, and PFG shall not have any obligation to make any inquiry or request any confirmation from or on behalf of any other Borrower as to the binding effect on it of any such request, instruction, report, information, other notice or communication, nor shall the joint and several character of Borrow ers' obligations hereunder be affected thereby. 
 (b)     Waivers. Each Borrower hereby waives: (i) any right to require PFG to institute suit against, or to exhaust its rights and remedies against, any other Borrower or any other Person, or to proceed against any property of any kind which secures all or any part of the Obligations, or to exercise any right of offset or other right with respect to any reserves, credits or deposit accounts held by or maintained with PFG or any indebtedness of PFG to any other Borrower, or to exercise any other right or power, or pursue any other remedy PFG may have; (ii) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of any other Borrower or any guarantor or any endorser, co-maker or other Person, or by reason of the cessation from any cause whatsoever of any liability of any other Borrower or any guarantor or any endorser, co-maker or other Person, with respect to all or any part of the Obligations, or by reason of any act or omission of PFG or others which directly or indirectly results in the discharge or release of any other Borrower or any guarantor or any other Person or any Obligations or any security therefor, whether by operation of law or otherwise; (iii) any defense arising by reason of any failure of PFG to obtain, perfect, maintain or keep in force any Lien on, any property of any Borrower or any other Person; (iv) any defense based upon or arising out of any Insolvency Proceeding, liquidation or dissolution proceeding commenced by or against or in respect of any Borrower or any guarantor or any endorser, co-maker or other Person, including without limitation any discharge of, or bar against collecting, any of the Obligations (including without limitation any interest thereon), in or as a result of any such proceeding. Until all of the Obligations have been paid, performed, and discharged in full, nothing shall discharge or satisfy the liability of Borrower hereunder except the full performance and payment of all of the Obligations. If any claim is ever made upon PFG for repayment or recovery of any amount or amounts received by PFG in payment of or on account of any of the Obligations, because of any claim that any such payment constituted a preferential Transfer or fraudulent conveyance, or for any other reason whatsoever, and PFG repays all or part of said amount by reason of any judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative body having jurisdiction over PFG or any of its property, or by reason of any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected by PFG with any such claimant (including without limitation the any other Borrower), then and in any such event, Borrower agrees that any such judgment, decree, order, settlement and compro mise shall be binding upon Borrower, notwithstanding any revocation 
 
 
 
or release of this Agreement or the cancellation of any note or other instrument evidencing any of the Obligations, or any release of any of the Obligations, and Borrower shall be and remain liable to PFG under this Agreement for the amount so repaid or recovered, to the same extent as if such amount had never originally been received by PFG, and the provisions of this sentence shall survive, and continue in effect, notwithstanding any revocation or release of this Agreement. Each Borrower hereby expressly and unconditionally waives all rights of subrogation, reimbursement and indemnity of every kind against any other Borrower, and all rights of recourse to any assets or property of any other Borrower, and all rights to any collateral or security held for the payment and performance of any Obligations, including (but not limited to) any of the foregoing rights which Borrower may have under any present or future document or agreement with any other Borrower or other Person, and including (but not limited to) any of the foregoing rights which Borrower may have under any equitable doctrine of subrogation, implied contract, or unjust enrichment, or any other equitable or legal doctrine. Each Borrower further hereby waives any other rights and defenses that are or may become available to Borrower by reason of California Civil Code Sections 2787 to 2855 (inclusive), 2899, and 3433, as now in effect or hereafter amended, an d under all other similar statutes and rules now or hereafter in effect. 
 (c)     Consents. Each Borrower hereby consents and agrees that, without notice to or by Borrower and without affecting or impairing in any way the obligations or liability of Borrower hereunder, PFG may, from time to time before or after revocation of this Agreement, do any one or more of the following in PFG's sole and absolute discretion: (i) accept partial payments of, compromise or settle, renew, extend the time for the payment, discharge, or performance of, refuse to enforce, and release all or any parties to, any or all of the Obligations; (ii) grant any other indulgence to any Borrower or any other Person in respect of any or all of the Obligations or any other matter; (iii) accept, release, waive, surrender, enforce, exchange, modify, impair, or extend the time for the performance, discharge, or payment of, any and all property of any kind securing any or all of the Obligations or any guaranty of any or all of the Obligations, or on which PFG at any time may have a Lien, or refuse to enforce its rights or make any compromise or settlement or agreement therefor in respect of any or all of such property; (iv) substitute or add, or take any action or omit to take any action which results in the release of, any one or more other Borrowers or any endorsers or guarantors of all or any part of the Obligations, including, without limitation one or more parties to this Agreement, regardless of any destruction or impairment of any right of contribution or other right of Borrower; (v) apply any sums received from any other Borrower, any guarantor, endorser, or co-signer, or from the disposition of any Collateral or security, to any indebtedness whatsoever owing from such Person or secured by such Collateral or security, in such manner and order as PFG determines in its sole discretion, and regardless of whether such indebtedness is part of the Obligations, is secured, or is due and payable. Borrower consents and agrees that PFG shall be under no obligation to marshal any assets in favor of Borrower, or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations. Borrower further consents and agrees that PFG shall have no duties or responsibilities whatsoever with respect to any property securing any or all of the Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, PFG shall have no obligation to monitor, verify, audit, examine, or obtain or maintain any insurance with respect to, any property securing any or all of the Obligations. 
 (d)     Independent Liability. Each Borrower hereby agrees that one or more successive or concurrent actions may be brought hereon against Borrower, in the same action in which any other Borrower may be sued or in separate actions, as often as deemed advisable by PFG. Each Borrower is fully aware of the financial condition of each other Borrower and is executing and delivering this Agreement based solely upon its own independent investigation of all matters pertinent hereto, and Borrower is not relying in any manner upon any representation or statement of PFG with respect thereto. Each Borrower represents and warrants that it is in a position to obtain, and each Borrower hereby assumes full responsibility for obtaining, any additional information concerning any other Borrower's financial condition and any other matter pertinent hereto as Borrower may desire, and Borrower is not relying upon or expecting PFG to furnish to it any information now or hereafter in PFG's possession concerning the same or any other matter. 
 (e)   Subordination. All indebtedness of a Borrower now or hereafter arising held by another Borrower is subordinated to the Obligations and Borrower holding the indebtedness shall take all actions r easonably requested by PFG to effect, to enforce and to give notice of such subordination. 
 8.23 Electronic Execution of Documents.  The words "execution," "signed," "signature" and words of like import in any Loan Document shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping systems, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including, without limitation, any state law based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. 
 
 
 
 8.24 Relationship. The relationship of the parties to this Agreement is determined solely by the provisions of this Agreement. The parties do not intend to create any agency, partnership, joint venture, trust, fiduciary or other relationship with duties or incidents different from those of parties to an arm's-length contract. 
 8.25 Third Parties. Nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, is intended to: (a) confer any benefits, rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement on any persons other than the express parties to it and their respective permitted successors and assigns; (b) relieve or discharge the obligation or liability of any person not an express party to this Agreement; or (c) give any person not an express party to this Agreement any right of subrogation or action against any party to this Agreement. 
 8.26 Mutual Waiver of Jury Trial.  BORROWER AND PFG EACH HEREBY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER PRESENT OR FUTURE INSTRUMENT OR AGREEMENT BETWEEN PFG AND BORROWER, OR ANY CONDUCT, ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF PFG OR BORROWER OR ANY OF THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, ATTORNEYS OR ANY OTHER PERSONS AFFILIATED WITH PFG OR BORROWER, IN ALL OF THE FOREGOING CASES, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE. WITHOUT INTENDING IN ANY WAY TO LIMIT THE PA RTIES' AGREEMENT TO WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY, if the above waiver of the right to a trial by jury is not enforceable, the parties hereto agree that any and all disputes or controversies of any nature between them arising at any time shall be decided by a reference to a private judge, mutually selected by the parties (or, if they cannot agree, by the Presiding Judge of the Santa Clara County, California Superior Court) appointed in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure Section 638 (or pursuant to comparable provisions of federal law if the dispute falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts), sitting without a jury, in Santa Clara County, California; and the parties hereby submit to the jurisdiction of such court. The reference proceedings shall be conducted pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure Â§Â§ 638 through 645.1, inclusive. The private judge shall have the power, among others, to grant provisional relief, including without limitation, entering temporary restraining orders, issuing preliminary and permanent injunctions and appointing receivers. All such proceedings shall be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed. If during the course of any dispute, PFG desires to seek provisional relief, but a judge has not been appointed at that point pursuant to the judicial reference procedures, then PFG may apply to the Santa Clara County, California Superior Court for such relief. The proceeding before the private judge shall be conducted in the same manner as it would be before a court under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings. The parties shall be entitled to discovery which shall be conducted in the same manner as it would be before a court under the rules of discovery applicable to judicial proceedings.

Nothing in this paragraph shall limit the right of PFG at any time to exercise self-help remedies, foreclose against Collateral, or obtain provisional remedies. The private judge shall also determine all issues relating to the applicability, interpretation, and enfor ceability of this paragraph.

 7. BORROWER INFORMATION:

 8. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS 
 
 
 (a) 
 
 Senior Lender. 
 
 
 (1) 
 
 Senior Lender. As used herein, "Senior Lender" means Silicon Valley Bank and any assignee thereof (or any financial institution which refinances the Indebtedness due to Silicon Valley Bank upon the same or more favorable terms and conditions applicable to such Indebtedness), provided that any such assignment shall require the prior consent of PFG, which consent will not unreasonably be withheld if the terms of the subordination agreement between PFG and such assignee (including Senior Debt Limit) are identical in all (other than identification of the parties) respects to the terms of the Senior Lender Subordination; and "Senior Loan Documents" means all present and future documents, instruments and agreements entered into between Borrower and Senior Lender or by  third parties relating to Borrower and Senior Lender. 
 
 
 (2) 
 
 Senior Debt Limit.  Borrower shall not permit the total Indebtedness of Borrower to Senior Lender, other than Non-Overdue Senior Monetary Obligations, to exceed $6,000,000 plus (i) interest and all collection costs (including attorneys' fees), (ii) all interest accruing after any bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, (iii) the amount of all Protective Advances, overdrafts of up to $200,000 in the aggregate at any given time, and (iv) certain products and/or credit services facilities,

 Partners for Growth    Schedule to Loan and Security Agreement 
 
 
 
 
including, without limitation, any letters of credit, guidance facilities, cash management services (including, without limitation, merchant services, direct deposit of payroll, business credit cards, and check cashing services), interest rate swap arrangements, and foreign exchange services up to $500,000 in the aggregate at any given time (collectively, the "Senior Debt Limit"). For the avoidance of doubt, the Senior Debt shall not include any obligations to the Senior Lender under the term loan facility being terminated by Borrower and the Senior Lender in the principal amount of $4,166,666.63, plus a final payment of $180,000, plus approximately $14,149.30 in interest, which facility is being paid off directly by PFG from the Loan proceeds (the " Existing SVB Term Loan"). 
 
 (3) 
 
 Senior Loan Documents.  Borrower represents and warrants that it has provided PFG with true and complete copies of all existing Senior Loan Documents, and Borrower covenants that it will, from time to time, provide PFG with true and complete copies of any future Senior Loan Documents, including without limitation any amendments to any existing Senior Loan Documents. 
 
 
 (b) 
 
 Collateral Accounts.  Concurrently, Borrower shall cause the banks and other institutions where its Collateral Accounts are maintained to enter into Control Agreements with PFG, in form and substance legally sufficient and otherwise satisfactory to PFG in its good faith business judgment and sufficient to perfect PFG's security interest in said Collateral Accounts, subject to the Lien of the Senior Lender. Said Control Agreements shall permit PFG, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to exercise exclusive control over said Collateral Accounts and proceeds thereof (subject to the rights of the Senior Lender). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Borrower maintains any Collateral Accounts on the Effective Date other than with the Senior Lender, so long as no Default or Event occurs and is continuing, PFG shall not require a Control Agreement if such Collateral Accounts are closed and the proceeds thereof transferred to Borrower's Collateral Accounts with the Senior Lender within sixty (60) days from the Effective Date. 
 
 
 (c) 
 
 Subordination of Inside Debt. All present and future indebtedness of Borrower to its officers, directors and shareholders ("Inside Debt") shall, at all times, be subordinated

 Partners for Growth    Schedule to Loan and Security Agreement 
 
 
 
 
to the Lien of PFG in respect of and prior payment of the Obligations. Borrower represents and warrants that there is no Inside Debt presently outstanding, except as set forth in   Exhibit A. Prior to incurring any additional Inside Debt, Borrower shall cause the Person to whom such Inside Debt will be owed to execute and deliver to PFG a subordination agreement in PFG's customary form.
