It is the Parties' express understanding and agreement that such materials are provided only for Buyer's convenience in making its own examination and determination prior to the Approval Date, as to whether or not it wishes to purchase the Property, and, in doing so, Buyer shall rely exclusively on its own independent investigation and evaluation of every aspect of the Property and, except as expressly set forth herein, not on any materials supplied by Seller.

 Purchase and Sale Agreement 
 Page 4 of 33 
 
 
 
title, if any, will be accepted by Buyer. Seller shall have three (3) Business Days after receipt of Buyer's objections to give to Buyer: (A) written notice that Seller will remove such objectionable exceptions on or before the Closing Date; or (B) written notice that Seller elects not to cause such exceptions to be removed. Seller's failure to give notice to Buyer within the three (3) Business Day period shall be deemed to be Seller's election not to cause such exceptions to be removed. If Seller gives Buyer notice or is otherwise deemed to have elected to proceed under clause (B), Buyer shall have until the later of (i) three (3) Business Days after receipt of Seller's actual or deemed notice as to Seller's unwillingness to cause such exceptions to be removed, or (ii) the end of the Due Diligence Period, to elect to proceed with the transaction or terminate this Agreement. If Buyer fails to give Seller notice of its election on or before the expiration of such period, Buyer shall be deemed to have elected to terminate this Agreement. If Seller gives notice pursuant to clause (A) and fails to remove any such objectionable exceptions from title prior to the Closing Date, and Buyer is unwilling to take title subject thereto, Buyer shall have  the right to elect to terminate this Agreement and   Section 14(a)  shall apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall be deemed to have objected to any lien encumbering the Property that secures the payment of money, such as mechanic's liens, materialmen's liens and judgment liens, and the liens of deeds of trust and mortgages (collectively, " Monetary Liens"), unless Buyer otherwise notifies Seller in writing. Monetary Liens shall not include non-delinquent assessments or bond amounts encumbering the property and reflected in the tax bills for the Property, non-delinquent property taxes or assessments, or non-delinquent dues, costs or assessments under declarations, reciprocal easements, or other covenants, conditions or restrictions to which the Property is subject. Seller hereby agrees to remove at or before the Closing and shall cause the Property to be delivered free and clear of, Monetary Liens caused by Seller, including the lien in favor of the Existing Lender. Buyer agrees that "removal" of an exception shall include the Title Company's willingness to endorse over such exception or provide affirmative assurance to Buyer of no loss or damage to Buyer from such exception. 
 (i)      New Exceptions. In the event the Title Company notifies Buyer of any New Exceptions to title after the Approval Date, Buyer shall have two (2) Business Days in which to notify Seller of its approval or disapproval of such New Exception. Failure to deliver notice of approval of such New Exception shall be deemed disapproval of the New Exception. If Buyer disapproves such New Exception, Seller shall notify Buyer within two (2) Business Days thereafter whether or not Seller can or will cause the removal of such New Exception. Failure to deliver such notice by Seller shall be deemed Seller's refusal to cause the removal of such New Exception. If Seller is unwilling or unable to cause the removal of such New Exception, Buyer shall have the right within two (2) Business Days thereafter in which to waive such objection to title and proceed to Closing, or terminate this Agreement, in which case   Section 14(a)  shall apply. Failure by Buyer to deliver notice of waiver shall be deemed Buyer's objection to title and election to terminate this Agreement. Buyer agrees that "removal" of a New Exception shall include the Title Company's willingness to endorse over such exception or provide affirmative assurance to Buyer of no loss or damage to Buyer from such New Excepti on. 
 (j)      Survey . Seller has provided Buyer with a copy of an ALTA survey of the Property (the " Survey "). If Buyer elects ALTA extended coverage title insurance, with survey 
 
 
 
 Purchase and Sale Agreement 
 Page 5 of 33 
 
 
 
coverage, Buyer shall have the right, at its cost, to update, modify, amend or re-certify the Survey as necessary in order for the Title Company to delete the survey exception from the Title Policy or to otherwise satisfy Buyer's objectives. Seller will consent to the use and update of such Survey by Buyer, at Buyer's cost. Buyer shall have the right to object to any matters shown in the Survey no later than six (6) Business Days prior to the end of the Due Diligence Period in accordance with Section 4(h). The receipt of an updated Su rvey shall not be a Buyer Closing Condition. 
 (k)      Title Commitment during Due Diligence Period. Buyer shall use diligent, good faith efforts to obtain from the Title Company no later than the end of the Due Diligence Period, such assurances and commitments as to policy form, coverage and endorsements as Buyer may request for the Title Policy. Delivery of the Approval Notice to Seller prior to the end of the Due Diligence Period shall constitute Buyer's approval of matters affecting title to the Property, including any such matters as are shown on the Survey, subject to Buyer's rights under   Section 4(h)  and any New Exceptions. Buyer may elect to obtain an owner's ALTA extended coverage title insurance policy, and such endorsements as Buyer may require, at Buyer's cost. Seller shal l execute and deliver to the Title Company the form of owner's title affidavit set forth in   Exhibit H  to this Agreement. It shall be a condition to Buyer's obligation to close the Escrow that the Title Company not be unwilling or unable to deliver to Buyer as of the Closing its irrevocable commitment to issue to Buyer its Title Policy consistent in all material respects with the commitment, if any, made by the Title Company as of the Approval Date, subject to New Exceptions approved by Buyer. For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the foregoing, if, as of the delivery of the Approval Notice, Buyer is negotiating with the Title Company as to the terms, coverage or endorsements to the Title Policy, it shall not be a condition to Buyer's obligation to close Escrow that the Title Company agree to such requests by Buyer or provide the coverage or assurances sought by Buyer. If, prior to the Approval Date, Buyer fails to obtain a commitment from the Title Company generally or as to any particular exception or term of the Title Policy sought by Buyer, Buyer shall be deemed, as of the delivery of the Approval Notice, to have waived objections to such matters (notwithstanding any further efforts to address such issues with the Title Company, and notwithstanding any agreement by Seller to cooperate with Buyer or the Title Company in addressing such matters) and approved all exceptions to title other than Monetary Liens and subsequent New Exceptions. 
 (l)      Buyer's Right to Terminate. At any time up to the Approval Date, Buyer has the unqualified right to terminate this Agreement and obtain a full refund of the Earnest Money (and any interest thereon), subject to Buyer's obligations to return Due Diligence Materials to Seller as provided in the Section entitled "Conditions to Closing." On or before the end of the Due Diligence Period, if Buyer is satisfied with its due diligence review of the Property and matters affecting the Property and wishes to proceed with the acquisition of the Property under this Agreement, Buyer shall give the Seller written notice of its approval of the Property and election to proceed under this Agreement (the " Approval Notice"). If Buyer fails to deliver an Approval Notice to Seller on or before the end of the Due Diligence Period, Buyer shall be deemed to have elected to terminate this Agreement, the Agreement shall automatically terminate as of the end of the Due Diligence Period, and Buyer's Earnest Money (and any interest thereon) shall immediately be returned to Buyer. If B uyer timely

 (ii)      Delinquent Rents for month in which the Closing occurred. If either Buyer or Seller collects any Rents or Additional Rents that were delinquent as of the Closing Date and that relate to the rental period in which the Closing occurred, then such Rents or Additional Rents shall be applied in the following order of priority: first, to reimburse Buyer or Seller for all reasonable out-of-pocket, third-party collection costs actually incurred by Buyer or Seller in collecting such Rents or Additional Rents (including the portion thereof relating to the period after the Closing Date); second, to satisfy such Tenant's Rent or Additional Rent obligations relating to the period after the Closing Date; and third, to satisfy such delinquent Rent or Additional Rent obligations relating to the period prior to the Closing Date.

collect such amounts due from any Tenant; provided that Buyer shall not be required to interfere with any Tenant's continued occupancy and full use of its premises under such Tenant's Lease, or Buyer's rights to receive Rent or Additional Rent with respect to any period beginning on the Closing Date. 
 (iii)      Percentage Rents. To the extent that Buyer receives any Percentage Rents after the Closing Date that are applicable to the period of time before the Closing Date (including any such amounts receiv ed after any cut-off date for prorated rents set forth in this   Section 7), Buyer shall render an accounting to Seller with respect to such Percentage Rents and such Percentage Rents shall be applied in the following order of priority: (i) first to Buyer for the period covered by such Percentage Rents following the calendar month in which the Closing occurred until the Tenant under its Lease is current with respect to all Percentage Rents applicable to periods after the Closing Date, and all expenses reasonably incurred by Buyer collecting such rents, (ii) then to Seller and Buyer for the calendar month in which the Closing occurred with such rents and other similar payments being prorated in the same manner as otherwise provided in this   Section 7  at Closing and on the Closing Statement, and (iii) then to Seller for the period prior to the month in which the Closing occurred. If Percentage Rents are based on other than a month-to-month basis (e.g., on a quarterly or annual basis), Percentage Rents collected by Buyer after the Closing Date and applicable to the period of time before the Closing Date shall be prorated as of the Closing Date based on the number of days in such period for which such Percentage Rents are paid. 
 (iv)      Expenses. With respect to any invoice received by Buyer or Seller after the Closing Date for Expenses that relate to the period in which the Closing occurred and for which a proration was not made at the Closing pursuant to the proration statement delivered to Buyer by Seller prior to the Closing, the Party receiving such invoice shall give the other Party written notice of such invoice, and the other Party shall have thirty (30) days to review and approve the accuracy of any such invoice. If the Parties agree that the invoice is accurate and should be paid, Seller shall compute Seller's pro rata share, write a check for that amount in favor of the vendor, and then send the invoice and check to Buyer, in which case Buyer agrees that it will pay for its share and forward the invoice and the two payments to the vendor. 
 (v)      Additional Rents; Payment of 2016 Expenses by Tenants; True Up. To the extent that Seller has actually collected any portion of Expenses from Tenants under the Leases as Additional Rents for calendar year 2016, Seller may retain all such Additional Rents in amounts not to exceed such Tenants' share of Expenses actually paid, as determined by the 2016 Stub Reconciliation (defined below). Within sixty (60) days after the Closing, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a reconciliation Expense statement for the period from and after January 1, 2016, to but not including the Closing Date (the " 2016 Stub Reconciliation"). If the 2016 Stub Reconciliation evidences that Seller under-collected Expenses from Tenants for such period, Buyer shall pay such amounts to Seller within thirty (30) days after delivery of the 2016 Stub Reconciliation, and Buyer shall be responsible to collect such amounts from Tenants. If the 2016 Stub Reconciliation evidences that Seller 
 
 
 
 Purchase and Sale Agreement 
 Page 12 of 33 
 
 
 
has over-collected Additional Rent from Tenants for such period and Buyer did not receive a credit at Closing for the Expenses to which such Additional Rents applies, Seller shall pay such over-collected amounts to Buyer within thirty (30) days after delivery of the 2016 Stub Reconciliation, and Buyer shall thereafter be responsible for making reimbursement to the Tenants or applying the same to Expenses in accordance with the Leases. The 2016 Stub Reconciliation shall be final and binding on the parties as to 2016 Additional Rent and shall not be subject to modification or adjustment based on subsequent or later reconciliations prepared by Buyer or required under the Leases.

 such R&W Change to eliminate such inaccuracy, Buyer shall have the right, as its sole and exclusive remedy, to terminate this Agreement, upon which termination the Earnest Money (plus interest earned thereon) shall be returned to Buyer and the Parties shall have no further rights or obligations under this Agreement except for those rights and obligations which expressly survive termination of this Agreement. If, prior to the Closing, Buyer has Actual Knowledge that any representation or warranty of Seller is inaccurate in any material respect and Buyer consummates the Closing, such representation or warranty shall be deemed modified by Buyer's Actual Knowledge.

 (c)      Cost of Tenant Improvements and Leasing Commissions . 
 (i)      New Leases, Renewals, Modifications. In connection with any new lease, or any renewal of a lease or modification of any existing Lease which extends the term or expands the premises under such Lease other than under an option or right governed by subsections (b)(iii) or (b)(iv) below, which new lease, renewal or modification is entered into between the Effective Date and the Closing, the cost of tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions in connection with any such new lease, renewal or modification, shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller in proportion to the ratio between the portion of the new lease term or renewal term (following the commencement of rental payments thereunder) which occurs prior to the Closing Date and the portion of the new lease term or renewal term (following the commencement of rental payments thereunder) which occurs after the Closing Date.

between Seller and Buyer in proportion to the ratio between the portion of the extended lease term (following the commencement of rental payments thereunder) resulting from the exercise of the option which occurs prior to the Closing Date and the portion thereof (following the commencement of rental payments thereunder) which occurs after the Closing Date. 
 (iv)      Post-Closing Extensions, Renewals, Modifications. If, on or after the Closing Date, any Tenant shall exercise an option or right under an existing Lease to renew the Lease, extend the term of the Lease, or expand its premises, any obligation for tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions associated with the exercise of such option or right shall be the responsibility of Buyer. 
 14. Non-Consummation of the Transaction. If the transaction is not consummated on or before the Closing Date, the following provisions shall apply: 
 (a)      No Default. If the purchase and sale of the Property under this Agreement is not consummated for a reason other than a default by one of the Parties, then (i) the Title Company and each Party shall return to the depositor thereof the Earnest Money and all other funds and items which were deposited hereunder (except that Seller shall retain the Non-Refundable Payment); and (ii) Seller and Buyer shall each bear one-half of any Escrow cancellation charges. Any return of funds or other items by the Title Company or any Party as provided herein shal l not relieve either Party of any liability it may have for its wrongful failure to close. 
 (b)      Default by Seller. If the transaction is not consummated as a result of a default by Seller, then Buyer, as its sole and only remedies hereunder, to the exclusion of all other potential remedies under this Agreement, at law or in equity, may either (i) terminate this Agreement by delivery of notice of termination to Seller, whereupon (A) the Earnest Money plus interest accrued thereon shall be immediately returned to Buyer, and (B) Seller shall pay to Buyer its Expense Reimbursement, in which case neither Party shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder other than those rights and obligations which expressly survive termination of this Agreement; or (ii) continue this Agreement pending Buyer's action for specific performance, provided, however, that any such action for specific performance shall not include an action for damages and shall be filed and served by Buyer within thirty (30) days of the date which is the later of (x) the termination of this Agreement by Seller, or (y) the date on which Buyer has Actual Knowledge of the event or occurrence comprising the alleged default on the part of Seller, it being the intent of the Parties hereto that any failure of Buyer to meet the time deadline set for filing shall be deemed to be Buyer's election to waive and relinquish any rights to enforce specific performance of this Agreement. In the event Buyer files an action for specific performance in accordance with subparagraph  (ii) above and Seller prevails in such action, then in addition to its obligations under   Section 15(l)  below, Buyer shall be obligated to pay to Seller an amount equal to the Specific Performance Amount as liquidated damages in order to compensate Seller for actual costs, damages and losses, as well as lost opportunity costs, suffered by Seller due to its inability to sell the Property to a third party pending the resolution of Buyer's specific performance action. Buyer acknowledges that the damages suffered by Seller due to a delay in selling the Property are difficult to determine and that the Specific Performance Amount 
 
 
 
 Purchase and Sale Agreement 
 Page 23 of 33 
 
 
 
has been agreed upon, after negotiation, as the parties' reasonable estimate of such Seller's damages. In no event shall Seller be liable to Buyer in connection with any breach or default on the part of Seller under this Agreement for any incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, including, without limitation, loss of profits or revenue, interference with business operations, loss of tenants, lenders, investors, buyers, diminution in value of the Property, or inability to use the Property. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer on its own behalf and on behalf of its agents, members, partners, employees, representatives, officers, directors, agents, related and affiliated  entities, successors and assigns (collectively, the " Buyer Parties") hereby agrees that in no event or circumstance shall any of the members, partners, employees, representatives, officers, directors, agents, property management company, affiliat ed or related entities of Seller or Seller's property management company (collectively, the " Seller Parties ") have any personal liability under this Agreement. 
 Buyer's Initials            
 (c)      Default by Buyer. If the Closing does not occur as a result of a default by Buyer, then (i) Buyer shall pay all escrow cancellation charges, (ii) to the extent it has not previously been delivered to Seller, the Title Company shall deliver the Earnest Money to Seller as its full and complete liquidated damages and its sole and exclusive remedy for Buyer's default (provided  that this provision shall not limit the Seller's right to enforce Buyer's obligations pursuant to   Sections 4(c) ,   15(f)   and   15(l), and to obtain monetary damages from Buyer pursuant to those provisions above and beyond any amounts collected pursuant to this liquidated damages provision). If the transaction is not consummated because of a default by Buyer, the Earnest Money together with the interest accrued thereon shall be paid to and retained by Seller as liquidated damages. THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED THAT SELLER'S ACTUAL DAMAGES, IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT BY BUYER, WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT OR IMPRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE. THEREFORE, BY PLACING THEIR INITIALS BELOW, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE EARNEST MONEY HAS BEEN AGREED UPON, AFTER NEGOTIATION, AS THE PARTIES' REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SELLER'S DAMAGES (IN ADDITION TO ANY FEES AND  COSTS TO WHICH SELLER IS ENTITLED UNDER   SECTION 15(l)) AND AS SELLER'S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AGAINST BUYER, AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ON THE PART OF BUYER; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, NOTHING HEREIN SHALL  RELIEVE BUYER OF THE INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF BUYER UNDER   SECTIONS 4(c) AND 15(f), WHICH EXPRESSLY SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this   Section 14(c), in the event of (i) Buyer's default under this Agreement, (ii) a termination of this Agreement by Buyer, or (iii) a termination of this Agreement by Seller as a result of a default on the part of Buyer, Seller shall have all remedies available at law or in equity if Buyer or any Person related to or affiliated with Buyer asserts any claims or right to the Property that (i) delays or prevents Seller from having clear, indefeasible, and marketable title to the Property or (ii) constitutes slander of title to the Property. In all other  events, Seller's remedies shall be limited to those described in this   Section 14(c)   and   Sections 15(f)   and   15(l)   hereof. If Closing is consummated, Seller shall have all remedies available

 3.This Assignment shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto, their heirs, executors, administrators, successors in interest and assigns. 
 4.The substantive laws of the State in which the Property is located, without reference to its conflict of law provisions, will govern the validity, construction, and enforcement of  this Assignment.
