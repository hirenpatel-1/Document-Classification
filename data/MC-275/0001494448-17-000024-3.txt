The Securities Intermediary shall have no duty to take any action to obtain an Acknowledgement from any Issuing Insurance Company; provided that the Securities Intermediary shall cooperate, in accordance with the written direction of the Borrower, with the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, or if the Securities Intermediary shall have received from the Administrative Agent written notice of an Event of Default, at the written direction of the Administrative Agent acting alone (with a copy sent by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower; provided that the delivery of such copy shall not be a condition to the effectiveness of such written direction), in executing any completed change of ownership/beneficiary forms from Issuing Insurance Companies that require signature by the new owner of a Policy.

Intermediary may not release any Policy from the Policy Account unless it receives an entitlement order executed by the Administrative Agent acting alone), substantially in the for m attached hereto as   Exhibit D-1   or   D-2, as applicable, in which case, the Securities Intermediary shall release the Policies that are the subject of such entitlement order and debit the Policy Account, in accordance with such entitlement order, to or as directed by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, acting jointly, or the Administrative Agent, acting alone, as applicable, in such entitlement order, in each case, within two (2) Business Days of its receipt of such entitlement order.

In the event that the Securities Intermediary, in such capacity, has or subsequently obtains by agreement of the parties hereto, operation of law or otherwise a security interest in a Pledged Account, any security entitlement in a Pledged Account or any Pledged Financial Assets, the Securities Intermediary hereby agrees that such security interest shall be subordinate to the security interests of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties. The financial assets and other items credited to or deposited in the Pledged Accounts will not be subject to deduction, set-off, banker's lien or any other right in favor of the Securities Intermediary or (to the fullest extent permitted by law) any Person other than the Administrative Agent with respect to the Pledged Accounts.

The Pledged Accounts (as well as the security entitlements related thereto) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that would apply the laws of another jurisdiction. Regardless of any provision in any other agreement, for purposes of the UCC, New York shall be deemed to be the location of the Securities Intermediary and the Pledged Accounts, and New York shall be deemed to be the jurisdiction of the Securities Intermediar y as a "securities intermediary" for the purposes of and within the meaning of the UCC. 
 
 Section 3.6  Conflict with Other Agreements; Amendments. As of the date hereof, there are no other agreements entered into between the Securities Intermediary, in its capacity as Securities Intermediary, and the Borrower with respect to the Pledged Accounts or any security entitlements or other financial assets credited thereto (other than the standard and customary documentation with respect to the establishment and maintenance of the Pledged Accounts). Neither the Securities Intermediary nor the Borrower shall enter into any other agreement with respect to the Pledged Accounts, including but not limited to agreements for creation or perfection of any security interest in, or control of security entitlements maintained in, the Pledged Accounts, without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent acting in its sole discretion. In the event of any conflict with respect to "control" over a Pledged Account between this Agreement (or any portion hereof) and any other existing or future agreement to

which any of the parties hereto is a party, such party agrees that the terms of this Agreement shall prevail. No amendment or modification of this Agreement or waiver of any rights hereunder shall be binding on any party hereto unless it is in writing and signed by all the parties hereto. 
 
 Section 3.7  Adverse Claims. Except for the claims and interest of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in any Pledged Financial Assets, the Securities Intermediary on the date hereof has no actual knowledge of any claim to, or security interest in, the Pledged Accounts or in any "financial asset" (as defined in Section 8-102(a)(9) of the UCC) credited thereto and does not have actual knowledge of any claim that any person other than the Administrative Agent has been given "control" of a Pledged Account or any such financial asset. If, to the actual knowledge of the Securities Intermediary, any Person asserts any lien, encumbrance or adverse claim (including any writ, garnishment, judgment, warrant of attachment, execution or similar process or any claim of "control") against any financial asset carried in a Pledged Account, the Securities Intermediary shall notify the Borrower and the Administr ative Agent thereof within two (2) Business Days of obtaining such actual knowledge. 
 
For so long as any Pledged Financial Assets are credited to the Pledged Accounts, the Securities Intermediary shall maintain possession or control of all such Pledged Financial Assets and other property credited to the Pledged Accounts in its proprietary collateral tracking and safe keeping system. The Securities Intermediary shall segregate such Pledged Financial Assets from its proprietary assets and keep the Pledged Accounts free of any lien, charge or claim of any third party granted or created by the Securities Intermediary. 
 
 Section 3.8  Maintenance of Pledged Accounts. In addition to, and not in lieu of, the obligation of the Securities Intermediary to honor entitlement orders as agreed in   Section 3.3   hereof, the Securities Intermediary agrees to maintain the Pledged Accounts as follows: 
 
(a) Except as expressly otherwise provided in this Agreement, on and after the Initial Closing Date and prior to the Termination Date, the Securities Intermediary agrees to take instructions with regards to all of the Pledged Accounts as follows: (a) if the Securities Intermediary shall not have received from the Administrative Agent written notice of an Event of Default, at the direction of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent acting jointly, or (b) if the Securities Intermediary shall have received from the Administrative Agent written notice of an Event of Default, at the direction of the Administrative Agent acting alone (with a copy sent by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower; provided that the delivery of such copy shall not be a condition to the effectiveness of such direction). Without limiting the generality of the first sentence of this paragraph, prior to the Termination Date, the Securities Intermediary shall not permit any transfers, sales, exchanges or other transactions with respect to any Policy credited to the Policy Account or any other Pledged Financial Assets to be initiated by the Borrower acting alone or any representative of, or investment manager appointed by the Borrower acting alone or any of their respective Affiliates acting alone and the Securities Intermediary shall only follow all instructions given by any of the Authorized Representatives of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower acting jointly (unless the Securities Intermediary shall have received from the Administrative Agent written notice of an Event of Default, in which case the Securities

In particular, but not by way of limitation (and subject to the exceptions set forth in the preceding sentence): 
 
(i) the Securities Intermediary shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in accordance with the written instructions (which form of instructions may include, but is not limited to, any exhibit hereto, an entitlement order, or an Alternative Information Notice) provided by the Administrative Agent or, if permitted under this Agreement, the Borrower, the Servicer, the Portfolio Manager, the Insurance Consultant or any other Person in accordance with and subject to this Agreement; 
 
(ii) no provision of this Agreement shall require the Securities Intermediary to expend or risk funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its rights or powers hereunder, if the Securities Intermediary shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liabili ty is not reasonably assured or provided to it;
