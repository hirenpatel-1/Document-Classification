 US\WOLFERI\13443347.3 
 
 
 
 " Designated Exclusion") and use its best efforts to remain eligible for the Designated Exclusion at all times thereafter. Promptly (and in any event no more than five (5) days) after the Company has become eligible for the Designated Exclusion, the Company shall deliver a 1940 Act Compliance Statement (defined below) to each Investor evidencing the Company's eligibility for the Designated Exclusion. Without the prior written consent of each Investor, which consent may be withheld for any or no reason, the Company will not take any action the result of which would reasonably be expected to cause the Company to become ineligible for the Designated Exclusion (whether or not the Company is then eligible for any other exclusion from the definition of "investment company" in Section 3(b) or Section 3(c) of the 1940 Act or in any rule promulgated thereunder). 
 (c)     Within five (5) days after the earlier of (i) the date the Company files with the SEC its quarterly report on Form 10-Q, or annual report on From 10-K, with respect to the fiscal quarter, or year, then ended (beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2017) and (ii) the last date on which the Company could timely file the report in respect of the applicable fiscal quarter, or year, referenced in clause (i) in accordance with applicable law, the Company shall deliver to each Investor a written statement in the form attached as Exhibit  B attached hereto (a " 1940 Act Compliance Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail the information and calculations contemplated thereby and otherwise reasonably necessary for such Investor to determine whether the Company is then in compliance with the Designated Exclusion, based on fair value accounting and all guidance issued by the Staff of the SEC with respect to calculations under Section 3(c)(5)(C) asset composition requirements under the 1940 Act. If, at any time after the Company relies on the Designated Exclusion, the Company becomes aware of any fact or circumstance, or any action is taken or not taken (including any agreement to act or not act) by or on behalf of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, the result of which would be that the Company is then not in compliance, or would be reasonably likely to be out of compliance, with the Designated Exclusion, the Company will provide prompt (in any event within 2 calendar days) written notice to each Investor describing the circumstances thereof, and including a 1940 Act Compliance Statement illustrating such non-compliance or expected non-compliance.

Each Investor agrees to cooperate in the determination of any required allocation of Net Indemnity Proceeds pursuant to this Section 5.2(b), and agrees, if applicable, to pay to the other Investors such portion of the Net Indemnity Proceeds received by such Investor as is required hereunder. For the avoidance of doubt: (i) in the event JPM asserts Claims against the Company that are not with respect to a Specified Breach but that are based upon facts that would support a Claim for a Specified Breach, then for purposes of this Section 5.2(b), all of the recoveries by JPM from the Company in respect of such Claims shall be deemed to have arisen from a Specified Breach and shall be allocated among, and disbursed to, all of the Investors pursuant to and in accordance with this Section 5.2(b), regardless of whether the other Investors have asserted or are able to assert such Claims; and (ii) the provisions of this Section 5.2(b) shall not apply to any Claims asserted against the Company by JPM or any of its affiliates or direct or indirect subsidiaries with respect to any agreement (including, without limitation, any loan made to the Company by JPM or any of its affiliates or direct or indirect subsid iaries) other than this Agreement.

 Section 5.3      Indemnification by Investors . Each Investor (the " Investor Indemnifying Party") shall indemnify and hold harmless, individually and not jointly and severally, the Company, its affiliates and stockholders, directors and officers (collectively, the " Investor Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all Claims sustained or incurred by any such Investor Indemnified Party, resulting from (i) any breach of a representation or warranty made by the Investor Indemnifying Party in this Agreement, and (ii) any breach of a covenant made by the Investor Indemnifying Party in this Agreement. The provisions of this   Section 5.3  are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Investor Indemnified Party. In no event shall any Investor Indemnifying Party be liable to any Investor Indemnified Party for any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect damages, including loss of future revenue or income, loss of business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, or diminution of value or any damages based on any type of multiple, except to the extent paid by an Investor Indemnified Party to a third party in respect of the claim for which such Investor Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder. 
 Section 5.4      Parity of Investors.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any of this Agreement, the Purchase Agreement or the Restated Certificate, and except to the extent (i) provided in Section 3.2 of this Agreement and (ii) provided in Section 11 of the Restated Certificate and Section 1.1.5 of Schedule I to the Restated Certificate as relates to a Preâ€‘Authorized Transfer to a JPM Permitted Transferee (each as defined in the Restated Certificate), each Party acknowledges that it is the intent and desire of the Parties, and each Party agrees, that, the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Restated Certificate and this Agreement shall not modify or otherwise alter the parity between the Series B-1 Stock and the Series B-2 Stock that existed pursuant to the terms of the Existing Certificate immediately prior to the date hereof.  In the event of any such modification or alteration of such parity in a manner that is adverse to an Investor, then: (a) the other Parties shall reasonably cooperate with such Investor to attempt to restore or otherwise accomplish such parity; and (b) if, after reasonably cooperating, the Parties are unable to restore or otherwise accomplish such parity, then the Company shall indemnify such Investor for the damages and other losses (including diminution in value) suffered by such Investor from such absence of parity, and such indemnification shall be such Investor's sole remedy with respect to such inability to restore or otherwise accomplish parity unless the Company is unable to restore or otherwise accomplish such parity in full.   Each Investor hereby agrees that the maximum amount it shall, and shall be entitled to, claim and recover as damages and other losses pursuant to this Section 5.4 from another Investor (the " Advantaged Investor") is: (x) one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the sum of (A) the Original Price (as defined in the Restated Certificate) per share of all the Series B Preferred Stock held by such Investor plus (B) the Dividends (as defined in the Restated Certificate) accrued and unpaid thereon, whether or not declared, through the date such Investor brings its claim again st the Advantaged Investor;   minus  (y) any amounts such Investor (or its affiliates) recover from the Advantaged Investor with respect to its (or their) claim pursuant to Section 5.2(b). For the avoidance of doubt, the immediately preceding sentence does not limit any Investor's ability to claim and recover against the Company pursuant to this Section 5.4.
