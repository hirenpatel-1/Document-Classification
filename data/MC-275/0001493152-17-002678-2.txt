If, however, for any reason any court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that any such restrictions are not reasonable, such restrictions shall be interpreted, modified or rewritten to include as much of the duration, scope and geographic area identified in this Section 5.7 as will render such restrictions valid and enforceable. 
   
(c) In the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Section 5.7, BOCO US shall be entitled, without the posting of a bond, to an injunction restraining such breach. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as prohibiting any party from pursuing any other remedy available to it for such breach or threatened breach.

 Section 8.2. Indemnification Procedures . 
   
(a) Any claim for indemnification on account of a Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a " Direct Claim") shall be asserted by the BOCO Indemnified Party giving the Sellers prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice,  provided that such notice is delivered within the Survival Period, shall not, however, relieve the Sellers of their indemnification obligations, except to the extent the Sellers can demonstrate actual material loss and prejudice as a result of such failure. Such notice by the BOCO Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim and include a reasonably detailed de scription of the amount of the Loss (the " Claimed Amount") actually incurred by the BOCO Indemnified Party and matter or condition set forth in Section 8.1(b) allegedly giving rise to the Direct Claim. The Sellers shall have 60 days aft er their receipt of such notice (the " Direct Claim Response Period") to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. During such Direct Claim Response Period, the BOCO Indemnified Party shall allow the Sellers and their professional advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount paid in respect of the Direct Claim is attributable to such matter or circumstance, and the BOCO Indemnified Party shall assist the Sellers' investigation by giving such information and assistance (including access to the BOCO Indemnified Party's premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or records) as the Sellers or any of their professional advisors may reasonably request. If the Sellers dispute their obligation to pay the Claimed Amount, BOCO US and the Sellers shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement as to the disputed matter. If BOCO US and the Sellers shall have failed to resolve such disputed matters within 90 days after expiration of the Direct Claim Response Period, then such outstanding dispute shall be determined  by arbitration conducted in accordance with Section 9.5. 
   
 
 
   23   
 
 
   
 
 
 
   
(b) In the event that any Legal Proceedings shall be instituted or that any claim or demand shall be asserted by any third party in respect of which indemnification may be sought u nder Section 8.1(b) hereof (a " Third Party Claim"), the BOCO Indemnified Party shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any Third Party Claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the Sellers. The failure of the BOCO Indemnified Party to give reasonably prompt notice of any Third Party Claim,  provided that such notice is delivered within the Survival Period, shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the Sellers' obligations with respect thereto except to the extent that the Sellers can demonstrate actual material loss and prejudice as a result of such failure. Subject to the provisions of this Section 8.2, the Sellers shall have the right, at their sole expense, to be represented by counsel of their choice and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against by them hereunder. If the Sellers elect to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against by them hereunder, they shall, within twenty days of the BOCO Indemnified Party's written notice of the assertion of such Third Party Claim (or sooner, if the nature of the Third  Party Claim so requires), notify the BOCO Indemnified Party of their intent to do so;  provided that the Sellers must conduct their defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently thereafter in order to preserve their rights in this regard. If the Sellers elect not to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses indemnified against by them hereunder, fails to notify the BOCO Indemnified Party of their election as herein provided or contests their obligation to indemnify the BOCO Indemnified Party for such Losses under this Agreement, the BOCO Indemnified Party may (subject to the terms of this Section 8.2(b)) at its sole expense defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim. If the Sellers shall assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, the BOCO Indemnified Party may participate, at his, her or its own expense, in the defense of such Third Party Claim;  provided ,  however, that such BOCO Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense with separate counsel if (i) so requested by the Sellers to participate or (ii) in the reasonable, good-faith opinion of counsel to the BOCO Indemnified Party, a conflict with respect to such Third Party Claim exists between the BOCO Indemnified Party and the Sellers that cannot be waived and would make such separate representation advisable. Each Party agrees to provide reasonable access to each other Party to such documents and information as may reasonably by requested in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.2 to the contrary, neither the Sellers nor any BOCO Indemnified Party shall, without the written consent of the other Party, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or permit a default or consent to entry of any judgment unless (x) the claimant (or claimants) and such Party provide to such other Party an unqualified release from all liability in respect of the Third Party Claim and such settlement or compromise, or such default or entry of judgment, as applicable, does not oblige such other Party to take or forbear any action or waive any right or (y) if such Third Party Claim is with respect to Taxes, such settlement or compromise, or such default or entry of judgment, as applicable, could not reasonably be expected to have an ad verse effect on the Sellers or BOCO US, as applicable. 
   
 
 
   24   
 
 
   
 
 
 
   
(c) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or the BOCO Indemnified Party and the Sellers shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement, in each case with respect to a Third Party Claim hereunder, the BOCO Indemnified Party shall forward to the Sellers and the Escrow Agent notice of any sums due and owing by the Sellers pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII with respect to such matter and the Sellers shall pay all of such remaining sums so due and owing to the BOCO Indemnified Party in accordance with Section 8.4.

(b) There shall be disregarded for all purposes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the application of the de minimis threshold in Section 8.3(c) below) any Direct Claim or Thi rd-Party Claim (each a " Claim") in respect of which the amount which a BOCO Indemnified Party would otherwise (but for the provisions of this Section 8.3(b)) be entitled to recover would be less than USD10,000 . 
   
(c) None of the Sellers shall be obligated to indemnify any Person with respect to any Losses arising out or relating to matters described in Section 8.1(b), until the aggregate am ount of all Losses in respect of indemnification under Section 8.1(b) exceeds USD40,000 (the " Minimum") in which event Seller shall be required to pay or be liable for all such Losses from the first dollar. 
   
(d) For purposes of determining the failure of any representations or warranties to be true and correct, the breach of any covenants or agreements, and calculating Losses hereunder, any materiality or Seller Material Adverse Effect or BOCO US Material Adverse Effect qualifications in the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall be disregar ded. 
   
 
 
   25   
 
 
   
 
 
 
   
(e) Notwithstanding anything contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) any Liability of the Sellers in respect of any Claim shall terminate absolutely if the action or proceeding in respect of it shall not have been commenced by being both issued and served on the Sellers, as the case may be, within the period of 6 months from the date on which the Sellers received notice from the BOCO Indemnified Party of such Claim; (ii) none of the Sellers shall be liable in respect of any Claim based upon a Liability that is contingent, only unless and until such contingent liability becomes an actual liability; and (iii) the Sellers shall cease to have any Liability for any Claim, unless notice is given in accordance with  Section 8.2 on or before the first anniversary of Closing Date. 
   
(f) Notwithstanding anything contrary contained in this Agreement, none of the Sellers shall have any liability in respect of any Claim to the extent that BOCO US is insured against any loss or damage suffered by any Seller forming the basis of the Claim in question under the terms of any insurance policy of BOCO US. 
   
(g) Where the scope of any Seller's liability in relation to any particular matter the subject of a specific warranty has been limited expressly pursuant to that or any other warranty or any other provision of this Agreement, the Sellers shall have no liability in respect of any Claim relating to such matter other than under the terms of that specific warran ty. 
   
(h) For the avoidance of doubt: (i) nothing herein shall limit BOCO US's obligation to mitigate its loss in respect of any Claim to the extent reasonable and practicable; and (ii) no BOCO Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover damages in respect of any Claim or otherwise obtain reimbursement or restitution more than once in respect of the same fact  or subject matter. 
   
 Section 8.4. Indemnity Escrow . 
   
(a) Any payment the Sellers are obligated to make to any BOCO Indemnified Parties pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII shall be paid, first, to the extent there are sufficient funds in the Escrow Account, by release of funds to the BOCO Indemnified Parties from the Escrow Account by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement, within five Business Days after the date notice of any sums due and owing is given to the Sellers (with a copy to the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement), by the applicable BOCO Indemnified Party and shall accordingly reduce the Escrow Account and, second, to the extent the Escrow Account is insufficient to pay any remaining sums due, then Sellers shall be required to pay all such additional sums due and owing to the BOCO Indemnified Parties by wire transfer of immediately available funds within five Business Days after the date o f such notice. 
   
(b) On the expiration of the Survival Period, the Escrow Agent shall release the funds in the Escrow Account (to the extent not utilized to pay for any indemnification claim), 85% of such funds to STEMCELLS Parent and 15% of such funds to the Consultants, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, except that the Escrow Agent shall retain an amount (up to the total amount then held by the Escrow Agent) equal to the amount of claims for indemnification under this ARTICLE VIII asserted prior to such expiration of the Survival  Period but not yet resolved (" Unresolved Claims"). The Escrow Account retained for Unresolved Claims shall be released by the Escrow Agent (to the extent not utilized to pay BOCO US for any such claims resolved in favor of BOCO  US) upon their resolution in accordance with this ARTICLE VIII and the Escrow Agreement.
