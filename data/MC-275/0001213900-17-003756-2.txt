 Test Reviews . D-R will have 5 days following delivery of the Initial System Deliverables (such 5-day period a " Deliverables Review Period") to determine whether the applicable requirements in this Annex A have been met. If D-R does not provide written notice to E-C of its determination that such requirements have not been fully met, specifying the reason for rejection, within 5 business days following the termination of the Deliverables Review Period, the requirements of this Annex A will be  deemed to have been met at the end of such 5 business days. 
   
 Rejections. If D-R provides timely notice that the requirements in this Annex A have not been met, E-C will have 10 business days from the date of receipt of such notice, unless otherwise provided for in a Customer contractual commitment, to commence a cure of all material non-conformances described in the written notice of rejection and to deliver to D-R a plan for prompt delivery of conforming Initial System Deliverables. Upon delivery of purportedly remedied Initial System Deliverables, these testing and rejection provisions will again apply, the new Deliverables Review Period running from the date of delivery of the new Initial System Deliverable. If the Initial System Deliverable is again rejected by D-R or fails to meet Customer contractual commitments, D-R may terminate the CMLA as provided in Section 9.1 of the Amendment. For avoidance of doubt, for the Initial System Project, D-R will hav e the right in its sole discretion to make the decision to replace the E-C Products with Plan B.

 Annex B 
   
 Initial System Testing 
   
 I. Objective 
   
The objective of this test is to meet the following acceptance test requirements for the Initial System at the Initial System Site. 
   
 Â·During the emissions testing, the Combined System will be operated at full rated power. The Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT) should be nominally  >[***]. Turbine Exit Temperature (TET) thermocouples may be used to calculate this. 
   
 Â·The emissions will be measured at the Power Oxidizer system exit flange interface with the Gas Turbine Inlet Flange (hot inlet-designated TP03) while operating on pipeline natural  gas only - VOCs from Pacific Ethanol site will not be introduced. 
   
 NOx  < [***] 
   
 CO  < [***] 
   
 VOCs (volatile organic compounds)  < [***] 
   
 II. Test set up 
   
The Initial System will be used to perform this emissions test. The system will be set up with an emissions sample port at the Power Oxidizer system exit. Figure 1 presents the location sampling port for the emissions. The port will include a tube that will be inserted to the depth of the flow to ensure the sample will be extracted from the main system flow. The emissions will be sampled in one location and will not traverse the flow path as is the standard with exhaust flow measurement methods. Traversing in this location is not poss ible due to the pressure boundary.

[***] = Certain confidential information contained in this document, marked by brackets, has been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Confiden tial treatment has been requested with respect to this omitted information. 
 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
   
A third party emissions tester will be utilized to measure emissions at this location and reported per SCAQMD methods 100.1 and 25.3. 
   
 NO x  = [***] is attainable by SCAQMD method 100.1. By using a span gas of [***] NO x  to calibrate the chemiluminescence NO x  analyzer, the third party emissions tester's Reporting Limit is NO x  = [***], but measured values should be lower . 
   
 CO < [***] is attainable by SCAQMD method 100.1. By using a span gas of [***] CO to calibrate the NDIR CO analyzer, the third party emissions tester's Reporting Limit is [***]. 
   
 VOC < [***] needs confirmation by third party emissions tester. SCAQMD method 25.3 is performed to measure the total VOC (NMOC).  Reporting limit is  [***] . 
   
 Instrumentation 
   
Below is a list of instrumentation needed to operate the Initial System to the right air cycle test conditions and collect data for the emissions test. Full accuracy descriptions will be provided for item 8. Ener-Core will only provide instrumentation for item #8. The balance of the instrumentation is provided by Dresser-Rand on the Initial System. 
   
 1. Power measurement 
   
 2. Ambient temperature measurement 
   
 3. Compressor inlet temperature 
   
 4. Barometer (relative humidity  & barometric pressure) 
   
 5. Differential pressure measurement across inlet filters 
   
 6. Backpressure measurement (D-R Gas Turbine exhaust pressure)

 7. Pressure measurements (compressor absolute pressure transducers) 
   
 8. NOx, CO and VOC emissions measurement equipment 
   
 9. D-R Gas Turbine exit temperature (6 K-type thermocouples) 
   
 Test Procedure 
   
The Initial System will start up utilizing pipeline natural gas. The Initial System will also use pipeline natural gas as the direct injected fuel for steady state operation. Full automation of the startup and steady state operation is not required to perform the test. While in steady state the Initial System will maintain full power by maintaining TP04 temperature that was previously defined by D-R during the FSAT test. Table 1 outlines the temperature versus ambient temperature. 
   
 Table 1:  Operational adjustment table for ambient temperature versus TP04 
   
 [***] 
   
This target temperature will be maintained with a tolerance of +/- 10F for the duration of the test. The TP04 measurements will be recorded with the six K type thermocouples located in the gas turbine exit (TE1476A-F). These temperatures are averaged providing a single TP04 measurement match. (Note: this is a production D-R Gas Turbine TP04 measurement set u p). 
   
Once the Initial System has been in Steady State for a minimum of 2 hours the emissions sampling per the emissions protocol will start. "Steady State" condition is defined as 2-3 hours after warmer burner is turned off. The emissions sampling will last for 2-3 hours. Once the emissions sampling is finished the test will be complete. 
   
E-C will provide a written report outlining the data and results (including any data supplied by D-R that might be requested by E-C), with the 3 rd  party emissions tester full report document supplied as an appendix. 
   
 Test Reviews . D-R will have 10 days following receipt of the complete report from E-C (such 10-day period a " Testing Review Period") to determine whether the applicable requirements in this Annex B have been met. If D-R does not provide written notice to E-C of its determination that such requirements have not been fully met, specifying the reason for rejection, within 5 business days following the termination of the Testing Review Period, the requirements of this Annex B will be deeme d to have been met at the end of such 5 business days.

If D-R provides timely notice that the requirements in this Annex B have not been met, E-C will have 10 business days from the date of receipt of such notice, unless otherwise provided for in a Customer contractual commitment, to commence a cure of all material non-conformances described in the written notice of rejection and to deliver to D-R a plan for prompt remediation and re-performance of Initial System Testing. Upon additional Initial System Testing following purported remediation by E-C, these testing and rejection provisions will again apply, the new Testing Review Period running from the date of receipt of the subsequent complete report from E-C.
