 RECITALS 
The Committee, acting on behalf of the Company, wishes to grant Recipient the number of Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units ("PSUs") set forth in Exhibit "A", on the terms and  subject to the conditions set forth in Exhibit "A", below and in the Plan. 
Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined in this Agreement will have the meaning assigned to them in the Plan. 
 AGREEMENT 
 It is hereby agreed as follows: 
 1. Award of Restricted Stock Units. The Company hereby grants to Recipient, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan and in this Agreement, the number of PSUs, effective as of                         (the "Date of Grant"). Each PSU represents the unfunded, unsecured right to receive one share of the Company's $0.01 par value common stock, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan, in Exhibit "A" and in this Agreement. The shares of stock that are issuable upon vesting of the PSUs granted to Recipient pursuant to this Agreement are referre d to in this Agreement as the "Shares". 
 2.      Vesting . 
 2.1     Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or in Section 2.2, the PSUs will vest as described in Exhibit "A". 
 2.2     In addition to the vesting provisions contained in Section 2.1 above, the PSUs will automatically and immediately vest in full (at 100% of target) if Recipient's employment with the Company is terminated within a period of six months following a Change in Control (i) by the Company for a reason other than Cause, as defined in the Plan, or (ii) by Recipient f or Good Reason, as defined below. 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
   
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2.3     For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall have the meaning, and be subject to the terms and conditions, as set forth in the severance agreement between the Company and th e Recipient or the severance plan in which the Recipient is eligible to participate, as applicable. 
 3.      Delivery upon Vesting . 
 3.1     Subject to Section 3.3, within thirty (30) days following vesting of any PSUs, the Company or, at the Company's instruction, its authorized representative, will deliver to Recipient the underlying Shares.

 3.2     The delivery of Shares is net shares after any applicable withholding taxes in accordance with Section 12 of the Plan. 
 3.3     This Agreement is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and shall be interpreted and construed consistently with such intent.

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if Recipient is a "specified employee," as defined in Section 409A of the Code, as of the date of Recipient's separation from service, then to the extent any amount payable under this Agreement (i) constitutes the payment of nonqualified deferred compensation, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, (ii) is payable upon Recipient's separation from service and (iii) under the terms of this Agreement would be payable prior to the six-month anniversary of Recipient's separation from service, such payment shall be delayed until the earlier to occur of (a) the six-month anniversary of the separation from service or (b) the date of Recipient's death. 
 4.      Effect of Termination of Employment or Other Service. If Recipient's employment or other service with the Company terminates, the effect of the termination on Recipient's PSUs under this Agreement will be as set forth in Section 12  of the Plan.  
 5.      Restrictions on Transfer of PSUs. The PSUs will not be transferable, either voluntarily or by operation of law, except as provided in Section 14.3 of the Plan. 
 6.      Rights as a Stockholder. Except as set forth in the Plan, neither Recipient nor any person claiming under or through Recipient shall be, or have any of the rights or privileges of, a 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 2 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
stockholder of the Company in respect of a Share issuable pursuant to this Award unless and until such Share shall have been delivered.

 8.      Clawback. Any portion of the payments, equity grants, equity vesting, including those under the Plan and this Agreement, as well as any other equity payments which Recipient receives pursuant to a Company plan or other arrangement, shall be subject to recoupment and clawback in the event of Recipient's termination for cause or violation of Plan terms, and to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, any Securities and Exchange Commission rule, and any implementing rules and regulations thereunder, or as required by law.

(f) The percentage of the Target PSUs earned shall be determined using straight-line interpolation between the performance levels set forth above, provided that no PSUs shall be earned for performance at levels below that indicated under the 50% column. The number of PSUs that are earned shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share. 
 
(g) For purposes of this award, EBITDA for each year shall be calculated as net income plus interest expense plus provision for income taxes plus depreciation plus amortization plus charges and credits, adjusted by the Committee for Extraordinary Events. 
 
"Extraordinary Events" means foreign exchange gains and losses, asset write downs, acquisitions and divestitures, change in fiscal year, unbudgeted capital expenditures, special charges such as restructuring or impairment charges, debt refinancing costs, extraordinary or noncash items, unusual, infrequently occurring, nonrecurring or one-time events affecting the Company or its  financial statements or changes in law or accounting principles. 
 
 TSR Modifier 
 
(a) The number of PSUs, if any, that is determined to have been earned pursuant to the cumulative EBITDA Performance Condition at the end of the fiscal three year period shall be subject to adjustment on the basis of the Company's TSR Performance Quotient, as per the table

 TSR Performance Quotient 
 
 Less than 1.15 
 
 1.15-1.30 
 
 Greater than 1.30 
 
 
 
 
(b) TSR Performance Quotient shall be determined by dividing (i) the average closing price of a share of the Company's Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (or, if different, the principal market on which the Company's stock then trades) for each of the trading days in February 2020 by (ii) the average closing price of a share of the Company's Common Stock on the NAS DAQ Global Select Market for each of the trading days in February 2017. 
 
 
 4.    Additional Terms 
 
(a) Subject to, and except as otherwise provided by, the Agreement or the Plan, the PSUs that are earned pursuant to the attainment of the performance conditions set forth in Section 3 shall vest only if the Recipient remains employed by the Company through the date of the Certification. 
(b) The number of PSUs granted pursuant to the Agreement and this Exhibit "A" has been approved by the Committee, with any PSUs categorized as "contingent" in Box 1 above being contingent on the approval of a Plan amendment by the stockholders of the Company at its 2017 annual meeting, which increases both the number of shares available for awards under the Plan and the annual limit on awards that may be granted to any one recipient in any tax year of the Company. If the stockholders of the Company do not approve such amendment, the number of PSUs that may be earned hereunder shall be reduced, assuming a target level of performance, by the number of PSUs that are contingent on shareholder approval, as shown in Box 1, above.
