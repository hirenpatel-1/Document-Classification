In the event the foregoing provisions should be construed by a court of competent jurisdiction not to constitute a valid, enforceable designation of a rate of interest, the unpaid principal balances outstanding hereunder shall bear interest at the maximum rate of interest which Hold er may lawfully charge under applicable law (the "Maximum Rate"). 
   
Repayment of the indebtedness represented by this September 2016 Amended, Restated and Substituted Promissory Note (the "Note") shall be as follows: 
    
Commencing on November 1, 2016, and continuing on the first (1st) day of each succeeding month through and including August 8, 2019, Maker shall pay to Holder thirty four (34) monthly payments of principal and interest, each in the amount of Fifteen Thousand Four Hundred Eleven and 48/100 United States Dollars ($15,411.48) (as set forth on the amortization s chedule attached hereto as Exhibit A), with a final payment of all outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest and all other sums payable pursuant to this Note or the Security Documents (defined below ) being absolutely and unconditionally due and payable on August 8, 2019 (the "Maturity Date"). 
   
All installments of principal and interest shall be payable to Holder, at 900 S. Shackleford, Little Rock, Arkansas 72211, or such other place as Holder or the subsequent holder hereof may designate in writing from time to time. If any payment of principal and interest on this Note shall become due on a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday under the laws of the State of Arkansas, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding business day. Any payment made after its due date shall carry a late charge equal to four percent (4.0%) of t he required payment, even if prior to occurrence of an Event of Default (defined below). 
   
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
    
Maker may prepay this Note in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, at any time. All payments and prepayments made by Maker are to be applied first (1st) to the payment of any late charges, then to payment of any sums due pursuant to the Security Documents (defined below), then to the payment of accrued interest then due at the rate stated herein, an d the balance shall be applied against outstanding principal balances due hereunder. 
    
This is a joint, several, irrevocable, unconditional and continuing promise of Maker to pay to Holder the indebtedness evidenced by this Note. 
   
Upon occurrence of any of the following events (an "Event of Default"), Holder or any subsequent holder hereof may declare the entire outstanding indebtedness of Maker evidenced by  this Note due and payable as to principal, accrued interest, late charges and any other sums due: 
   
(a)        Maker shall fail to pay any amount of principal and interest or any pall thereof, under this Note within ten (10) calendar days after such payment is due; or 
   
(b)        Maker shall voluntarily become a party to any insolvency, bankruptcy, composition or reorganization proceeding; or make any assignment for the benefit of creditors; or if any involuntary bankruptcy, insolvency, composition, or other reorganization proceeding be filed against Maker, and the same shall not be dismissed within thirty (30) days after  the commencement of any such involuntary proceeding; or 
   
(c)        Upon any default in any of the terms, warranties, covenants and provisions of any Security Document (defined herein) or any other promissory note executed by or other ob ligation owed by Maker to Holder. 
   
If this Note is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection, by suit or otherwise, or for the protection of Holder's interest hereunder, Maker shall pay all costs of collecti on and all court costs and attorneys' fees, costs and expenses incurred by Holder. 
    
From and after the Maturity Date or the date an Event of Default (in the event of acceleration of the indebtedness evidenced hereby by reason of Maker's default or otherwise), the entire indebtedness due hereunder including any accrued interest and late charges shall bear interest at the Maximum Rate until payment in full of all principal and interest, late  payment charges and other sums due hereunder are made. 
   
Maker hereby expressly waives, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any of the following rights: notice of acceleration, demand prior to foreclosure, presentment, protest, or no tice of protest. 
   
 
 
 2   
 
 
   
 
 
   
It is the intention of Maker and Holder to comply strictly with applicable usury laws. In no event and upon no contingency shall Holder ever be entitled to receive, collect or apply as interest any fees, charges or other payments labeled or ostensibly collected as interest, in excess of the Maximum Rate; and in the event Holder ever receives, collects or applies as interest any such excess, such amount, which but for this provision would be excessive interest, shall be applied to the reduction of the principal amount outstanding under this Note and if such outstanding principal amount and all lawful interest and other sums due is paid in full, any remaining excess shall be paid to Maker or other party lawfully entitled thereto. Any provision hereof or of any other agreement between Maker and Holder that operates to bind, obligate or compel Maker to pay interest in excess of the Maximum Rate shall require payment of the Maximum Rate only. The provisions of this paragraph shall be given precedence over any other provision contained herein or in any other agreement b etween Maker and Holder that is in conflict with the provisions of this paragraph. 
   
 This Note shall be construed according to the laws of the State of Arkansas. 
   
If any provision hereof shall be construed to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions hereof shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability. Each term o r provision hereof shall, however, he valid and be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
   
This Note is secured by, and may now or hereafter be secured by, mortgages, guaranties, trust deeds, assignments, security agreements, or other instruments of pledge or hypothecati on (collectively, the "Security Documents" or separately, a "Security Document").
