Borrower agrees to pay all costs and expenses incurred by Holder in connection with the collection of any and all sums due or payable hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fee and costs to outside counsel, or to preserve or protect any rights of Holder pursuant to this Note. The remedies of Holder shall be cumulative and concurrent, and may be pursued singly, successively and together at the sole discretion of Holder, and may be exercised as often as occasion therefor shall occur, and the failure to exercise any such right or remedy shall in no event be construed as a waiver or release of the same.

The words "Holder" and "Borrower" whenever occurring herein shall be deemed and construed to include the respective representatives, successors and assigns of Holder and Borrower and the singular shall include the plural. No waiver of any non-payment or other default hereunder shall be considered valid unless in writing and signed by Holder, and no such waiver shall be deemed a waiver of any subsequent non-payment or default, irrespective of whether such non-payment or other default shall be of the same or similar nature. 
   
This Note may not be amended or modified, nor shall any waiver of any of the provisions hereof be effective, except by an instrument in writing executed by Holder.

Should any provision of this Note be held to be illegal or unenforceable, the balance of the document shall  be construed as if the illegal or unenforceable provision were not included. 
   
This instrument shall be construed according to and governed by the laws of the State of Florida without regard to conflicts of law principles, except to the extent that those laws may be preempted by the laws of the United States of America. Borrower and Holder consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Federal or state courts located in the State of Florida and agree that venue shall be proper and the forum shall be convenient in Miami-Dade County, Florida, as selected by the holder of this Note, if suit is filed to enforce, interp ret or construe this Note. 
   
 
 
     
 
 
   
 
 
   
All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing, delivered by hand, certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested or by verified overnight delivery, and  shall be deemed made upon actual receipt by the party to whom addressed.
