If the Performance Goals are not met, than the Performance Shares granted herein shall lapse and be of no further force or effect. 
 
 
 (b) In addition, the Performance Shares subject to this Grant shall Vest as follows (the  " Service Condition "): One hundred percent (100%) of such Performance Shares shall vest upon the Award Date if the Participant receiving such award remains employed by the Company on the Award Date. N otwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant 's employment with the Company is terminated because of a Termination Event (as defined in the Incentive Plan relating to death, disability, retirement at or after the Participant ' s 62 nd birthday, or termination within a certain time following a Change of Control), then the Service Condition shall be deemed to have been met as to a portion of the unvested Performance Shares as equals the percent of the Service Condition which has been met as of the Termination Event.
