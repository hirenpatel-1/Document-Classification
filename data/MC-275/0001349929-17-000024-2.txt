The parties agree that the Prior Loan Agreement is hereby superseded and replaced in its enti rety by this Agreement, and the parties agree as follows: 
 1 ACCOUNTING AND OTHER TERMS 
Accounting terms not defined in this Agreement shall be construed following GAAP. Calculations and determinations must be made following GAAP. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in Section 13. All other terms contained in this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated, shall have the meaning provided by th e Code to the extent such terms are defined therein. 
 2      LOAN AND TERMS OF PAYMENT 
 2.1      Promise to Pay. Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay Bank the outstanding principal amount of all Credit Extensions and accrued and unpaid interest thereon as and when due in accordan ce with this Agreement. 
 2.2      Revolving Line. 
 (a)     Availability. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to deduction of Reserves, Bank may, in its good faith business discretion, make Advances not exceeding the Availability Amount. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Line may be repaid and, prior to the Revolving Line Maturity Date, reborrowed, subject to the applicable terms and conditions precedent  herein. 
 (b)     Termination; Repayment. The Revolving Line terminates on the Revolving Line Maturity Date, when the principal amount of all Advances, the unpaid interest thereon, and all other Obligations relating to t he Revolving Line shall be immediately due and payable. 
 2.3      Overadvances. If, at any time, the outstanding principal amount of any Advances exceeds the lesser of either the Revolving Line or the Borrowing Base, Borrower shall immediately pay to Bank in  cash the amount of such excess (such excess, the " Overadvance"). Without limiting Borrower's obligation to repay Bank any Overadvance, Borrower agrees to pay Bank interest on the outstanding amount of any Overadvance, on demand, at a per ann um rate equal to the rate that is otherwise applicable to Advances plus four percent (4.0%). 
 2.4      Payment of Interest on the Credit Extensions. 
 (a)     Interest Rate. Subject to Section 2.4(b), the principal amount outstanding under the Revolving Line shall accrue interest at a floating per annum rate equal to one and one-half of one percent (1.50%) above the Prime Rate, which interest shall be payable monthly in accordance with Section 2.4(d) below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (b)     Default Rate. Immediately upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Obligations shall bear interest at a rate per annum which is four percent (4.0%) above the rate  that is otherwise applicable thereto (the " Default Rate"). Fees and expenses which are required to be paid by Borrower pursuant to the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, Bank Expenses) but are not paid when due shall bear interest until paid at a rate equal to the highest rate applicable to the Obligations. Payment or acceptance of the increased interest rate provided in this Section 2.4(b) is not a permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of Bank. 
 (c)     Adjustment to Interest Rate. Changes to the interest rate of any Credit Extension based on changes to the Prime Rate shall be effective on the effective date of any change to the Prime Rate and to the extent  of any such change. 
 (d)     Payment; Interest Computation. Interest is payable monthly on the Payment Date of each month and shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed. In computing interest, (i) all payments received after 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on any day shall be deemed received at the opening of business on the next Business Day, and (ii) the date of the making of any Credit Extension shall be included and the date of payment shall be excluded; provided, however, that if any Credit Extension is repaid on the same day on which it is made, such  day shall be included in computing interest on such Credit Extension. 
 2.5      Fees . Borrower shall pay to Bank: 
 (a)     Revolving Line Commitment Fee. A fully earned, nonâ€‘refundable commitment fee of Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000.00), on the Effective Date; 
 (b)     Anniversary Fee . A fully earned, non-refundable anniversary fee of Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000.00) (the " Anniversary Fee") is earned as of the Effective Date and is due and payable on the earlier to occur of (i) the one (1) year anniversary of the Effective Date, (ii) the termination of this Agreeme nt, or (iii) the occurrence of an Event of Default; 
 (c)     Unused Revolving Line Facility Fee. Payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter occurring thereafter prior to the Revolving Line Maturity Date, and on the Revolving Line Maturity Date, a f ee (the " Unused Revolving Line Facility Fee") in an amount equal to one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) per annum of the average unused portion of the Revolving Line, computed on the basis of a year with the applicable number of days as set forth in Section 2.4(d).  The unused portion of the Revolving Line, for purposes of this calculation, shall be calculated on a calendar year basis and shall equal the difference between (i) the Revolving Line, and (ii) the average for the period of the daily closing balance of the Revolving Line outstanding; and 
 (d)     Bank Expenses. All Bank Expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses for documentation and negotiation of this Agreement) incurred through and after the Effective Date, when due  (or, if no stated due date, upon demand by Bank). 
Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement or in a separate writing by Bank, Borrower shall not be entitled to any credit, rebate, or repayment of any fees earned by Bank pursuant to this Agreement notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement or the suspension or termination of Bank's obligation to make loans and advances hereunder. Bank may deduct amounts owing by Borrower under the clauses of this Section 2.5 pursuant to the terms of Section 2.6(c).

(b)    Bank has the exclusive right to determine the order and manner in which all payments with respect to the Obligations may be applied. Borrower shall have no right to specify the order or the accounts to which Bank shall allocate or apply any payments required to be made by Borrower to Bank or otherwise received by Bank under this Agreement when any suc h allocation or application is not specified elsewhere in this Agreement. 
(c)    Bank may debit any of Borrower's deposit accounts, including the Designated Deposit Account, for principal and interest payments or any other amounts Borrower owes Bank when  due. These debits shall not constitute a set-off. 
 2.7      Withholding.  Payments received by Bank from Borrower under this Agreement will be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, deductions, withholdings, assessments, fees or other charges imposed by any Governmental Authority (including any interest, additions to tax or penalties applicable thereto). Specifically, however, if at any time any Governmental Authority, applicable law, regulation or international agreement requires Borrower to make any withholding or deduction from any such payment or other sum payable hereunder to Bank, Borrower hereby covenants and agrees that the amount due from Borrower with respect to such payment or other sum payable hereunder will be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of such required withholding or deduction, Bank receives a net sum equal to the sum which it would have received had no withholding or deduction been required, and Borrower shall pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority. Borrower will, upon request, furnish Bank with proof reasonably satisfactory to Bank indicating that Borrower has made such withholding payment; provided, however, that Borrower need not make any withholding payment if the amount or validity of such withholding payment is contested in good faith by appropriate and timely proceedings and as to which payment in full is bonded or reserved against by Borrower. The agreements and obligations of Borrower contained in this Section 2.7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

Bank may make Advances under this Agreement based on instructions from an Authorized Signer or without instructions if the Advances are necessary to meet Obligations which have become due. 
 4      CREATION OF SECURITY INTEREST 
 4.1      Grant of Security Interest.  Borrower hereby grants Bank, to secure the payment and performance in full of all of the Obligations, a continuing security interest in, and pledges to Bank, the Collateral, wherever located, whether now owned or hereafter acquired or arising, and all proceeds and products thereof. 
Borrower acknowledges that it previously has entered, and/or may in the future enter, into Bank Services Agreements with Bank. Regardless of the terms of any Bank Services Agreement, Borrower agrees that any amounts Borrower owes Bank thereunder shall be deemed to be Obligations hereunder and that it is the intent of Borrower and Bank to have all such Obligations secured by the first priority perfected security interest in the Collateral granted herein (subject only to Permitted Liens that are permitted pursuant to the terms of this A greement to have superior priority to Bank's Lien in this Agreement). 
If this Agreement is terminated, Bank's Lien in the Collateral shall continue until the Obligations (other than inchoate indemnity obligations) are repaid in full in cash. Upon payment in full in cash of the Obligations (other than inchoate indemnity obligations) and at such time as Bank's obligation to make Credit Extensions has terminated, Bank shall, at the sole cost and expense of Borrower, release its Liens in the Collateral and all rights therein shall revert to Borrower. In the event (x) all Obligations (other than inchoate indemnity obligations), except for Bank Services, are satisfied in full, and (y) this Agreement is terminated, Bank shall terminate the security interest granted herein upon Borrower providing cash collateral acceptable to Bank in its good faith business judgment for Bank Services, if any. In the event such Bank Services consist of outstanding Letters of Credit, Borrower shall provide to Bank cash collateral in an amount equal to (x) if such Letters of Credit are denominated in Dollars, then at least one hundred five percent (105.0%); and (y) if such Letters of Credit are denominated in a Foreign Currency, then at least one hundred ten percent (110.0%), of the Dollar Equivalent of the face amount of all such Letters of Credit plus all interest, fees, and costs due or to become due in connection therewith (as estimated by Bank in its business judgment), to secure all of the Obligations relat ing to such Letters of Credit. 
 4.2      Priority of Security Interest. Borrower represents, warrants, and covenants that the security interest granted herein is and shall at all times continue to be a first priority perfected security interest in the Collateral (subject only to Permitted Liens that are permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to have superior priority to Bank's Lien under this Agreement). If Borrower shall acquire a commercial tort claim, Borrower shall promptly notify Bank in a writing signed by Borrower of the general details thereof and grant to Bank in such writing a security interest therein and in the proceeds thereof, all upon the terms of this Agreement, with such writing to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Bank. 
 4.3      Authorization to File Financing Statements. Borrower hereby authorizes Bank to file financing statements, without notice to Borrower, with all appropriate jurisdictions to perfect or protect Bank's interest or rights hereunder, including a notice that any disposition of the Collateral, by either Borrower or any other Person, shall be deemed to violate the rights of Bank under the Code. Such financing statements may indicate the Collateral as "all assets of the Debtor" or words of similar effect, or as being of an equal or lesser scope, or with greater detail, all in Bank's di scretion.

If Borrower is not now a Registered Organization but later becomes one, Borrower shall promptly notify Bank of such occurrence and provide Bank with Borrower's organizational identification number.

The Accounts are bona fide, existing obligations of the Account Debtors. 
The Collateral is not in the possession of any third party bailee (such as a warehouse) except as otherwise provided in the Perfection Certificate. None of the components of the Collateral shall be maintained at locations other than as provided in the Perfection Certificate or as permitted pursuant to Section 7.2. 
All Inventory is in all material respects of good and marketable quality, free from material defects.

Each Patent which it owns or purports to own and which is material to Borrower's business is valid and enforceable, and no part of the Intellectual Property which Borrower owns or purports to own and which is material to Borrower's business has been judged invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part. To Borrower's knowledge, no claim has been made that any part of the Intellectual Property violates the rights of any third party except to the extent such claim would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on  Borrower's business.

Borrower has no knowledge of any actual or imminent Insolvency Proceeding of any Account Debtor whose accounts are Eligible Accounts in any Borrowing Base Report. To Borrower's knowledge, all signatures and endorsements on all documents, instruments, and agreements relating to all Eligible Accounts are genuine, and all such documents, instruments and agreements are legally enforceable in acco rdance with their terms.

Except as noted on the Perfection Certificate, there are no actions or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of any Responsible Officer, threatened in writing by or against Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries involving more than, individually or in the aggregate, Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00). 
 5.5      Financial Statements; Financial Condition. All consolidated financial statements for Borrower and any of its Subsidiaries delivered to Bank fairly present in all material respects Borrower's consolidated financial condition and Borrower's consolidated results of operations.

Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries have obtained all consents, approvals and authorizations of, made all declarations or filings with, and given all notices to, all Governmental Authorities that are necessary to continue their respective businesses as current ly conducted.

To the extent Borrower defers payment of any contested taxes, Borrower shall (i) notify Bank in writing of the commencement of, and any material development in, the proceedings, an d (ii) post bonds or take any other steps 
 
 
 -7- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
required to prevent the governmental authority levying such contested taxes from obtaining a Lien upon any of the Collateral that is other than a Permitted Lien. Borrower is unaware of any claims or adjustments proposed for any of Borrower's prior tax years which could result in additional taxes becoming due and payable by Borrower in excess of Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00). Borrower has paid all amounts necessary to fund all present pension, profit sharing and deferred compensation plans in accordance with their terms, and Borrower has not withdrawn from participation in, and has not permitted partial or complete termination of, or permitted the occurrence of any other event with respect to, any such plan which could reasonably be expected to result in any liability of Borrower, including any liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or its successors or any othe r governmental agency.

 5.11      Full Disclosure. No written representation, warranty or other statement of Borrower in any certificate or written statement given to Bank, as of the date such representation, warranty, or other statement was made, taken together with all such written certificates and written statements given to Bank, contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained in the certificates or statements not misleading (it being recognized by Bank that the projections and forecasts provided by Borrower in good faith and based upon reasonable assumptions are not viewed as facts and that actual results during the period or periods covered by such projections and forecasts ma y differ from the projected or forecasted results). 
 5.12      Definition of "Knowledge . "  For purposes of the Loan Documents, whenever a representation or warranty is made to Borrower's knowledge or awareness, to the "best of" Borrower's knowledge, or with a similar qualification, knowledge or awareness means the actual knowledge, after reasonable investigation, of any Responsible Officer.

Subject to Bank's right to maintain a reserve pursuant to Section 6.3(d), all amounts received in the Cash Collateral Account shall be (i) applied to immediately reduce the Obligations when a Streamline Period is not in effect (unless Bank, in its sole discretion, at times when an Event of Default exists, elects not to so apply such amounts), or (ii) so long as no Event of Default exists, transferred on a daily basis to Borrower's operating account with Bank when a Streamline Period is in effect. Borrower hereby authorizes Bank to transfer to the Cash Collateral Account any amounts that Bank reasonably determines are proceeds of the Accounts (provided that Bank is under no obligation to do so and this allowance  shall in no event relieve Borrower of its obligations hereunder). 
 (d)     Reserves. Notwithstanding any terms in this Agreement to the contrary, at times when an Event of Default exists, Bank may hold any proceeds of the Accounts and any amounts in the Cash Collateral Account that are not applied to the Obligations pursuant to Section 6.3(c) above (including amounts otherwise required to be transferred to Borrower's operating account with Bank when a Streamline Period is in effect) as a reserve to be applied to any Obligations regardless of whether such Obligations are then due and payable.

Bank may, from time to time, (i) verify and confirm directly with the respective Account Debtors the validity, amount and other matters relating to the Accounts, either in the name of Borrower or Bank or such other name as Bank may choose, and notify any Account Debtor of Bank's security interest in such Account and/or (ii) conduct a credit check of any Account Debtor to approve any such Account Debtor's credit. In addition, Bank may notify Account Debtors to make payments in respect of Accounts directly to Bank. Except during the existence of an Event of Default, Bank shall consult with Borrower prior to making any direct contact with an Account Debtor. 
 (g)     No Liability .  Bank shall not be responsible or liable for any shortage or discrepancy in, damage to, or loss or destruction of, any goods, the sale or other disposition of which gives rise to an Account, or for any error, act, omission, or delay of any kind occurring in the settlement, failure to settle, collection or failure to collect any Account, or for settling any Account in good faith for less than the full amount thereof, nor shall Bank be deemed to be responsible for any of Borrower's obligations under any contract or agreement giving rise to an Account. Nothing herein shall, however, relieve Bank from liability for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

Borrower agrees that it will not commingle proceeds of Collateral with any of Borrower's other funds or property, but will hold such proceeds separate and apart from such other funds and property and in an express trust for Bank. Nothing in this Section 6.4 limits the restrictions on  disposition of Collateral set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. 
 6.5      Taxes; Pensions. Timely file, and require each of its Subsidiaries to timely file, all required tax returns and reports and timely pay, and require each of its Subsidiaries to timely pay, all foreign, federal, state and local taxes, assessments, deposits and contributions owed by Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries, except for deferred payment of any taxes contested pursuant to the terms of Section 5.9 hereof, and shall deliver to Bank, on demand, appropriate certificates attesting to such payments, and pay all amounts necessary to fund all presen t pension, profit sharing and deferred compensation plans in accordance with their terms.

Such inspections and audits shall be conducted as frequently as Bank determines in its sole but reasonable discretion that conditions warrant. The foregoing inspections and audits shall be conducted at Borrower's expense and the charge therefor shall be One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) per person per day (or such higher amount as shall represent Bank's then-current standard charge for the same), plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. In the event Borrower and Bank schedule an audit more than ten (10) days in advance, and Borrower cancels or seeks to or reschedules the audit with less than ten (10) days written notice to Bank, then (without limiting any of Bank's rights or remedies) Borrower shall pay Bank a fee of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) plus any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Bank to compen sate Bank for the anticipated costs and expenses of the cancellation or rescheduling. 
 6.7      Insurance. 
(a)    Keep its business and the Collateral insured for risks and in amounts standard for companies in Borrower's industry and location and as Bank may reasonably request. Insurance policies shall be in a form, with financially sound and reputable insurance companies that are not Affiliates of Borrower, and in amounts that are satisfactory to Bank. All property policies shall have a lender's loss payable endorsement showing Bank as lender loss payee. All liability policies shall show, or have endorsements showing, Bank as an additional insured. Bank shall be named as lender loss payee and/or additional insured with respect to any such insurance providing coverage in respect of any Collateral. 
(b)    Ensure that proceeds payable under any property policy are, at Bank's option, payable to Bank on account of the Obligations. 
(c)    At Bank's request, Borrower shall deliver certified copies of insurance policies and evidence of all premium payments. Each provider of any such insurance required under this Section 6.7 shall agree, by endorsement upon the policy or policies issued by it or by independent instruments furnished to Bank, that it will give Bank thirty (30) days prior written notice before any such policy or policies shall be materially altered or canceled. If Borrower fails to obtain insurance as required under this Section 6.7 or to pay any amount or furnish any required proof of payment to third persons and Bank, Bank may make all or part of such payment or obtain such insurance policies required in this Section 6.7, and  take any action under the policies Bank deems prudent. 
 6.8      Accounts. 
(a)    Maintain all and all of its Subsidiaries' operating and other depository accounts, the Cash Collateral Account and securities/investment accounts with Bank and Bank's Affiliates; provided, however, during the Transition Period, Borrower shall be permitted to maintain (i) lockbox accounts with JP Morgan Chase Bank (the " Chase Accounts ") provided that Borrower shall transfer any and all funds maintained or deposited into the Chase

 -18- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9.1      Rights and Remedies. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Bank may, without notice or demand, do any or all of the following: 
(a)    declare all Obligations immediately due and payable (but if an Event of Default described in Section 8.5 occurs all Obligations are immediately due and payable without any action by Bank); 
(b)    stop advancing money or extending credit for Borrower's benefit under this Agreement or under any other agreement between Borrower and Bank; 
(c)    demand that Borrower (i) deposit cash with Bank in an amount equal to at least (A) one hundred five percent (105.0%) of the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate face amount of all Letters of Credit denominated in Dollars remaining undrawn, and (B) one hundred ten percent (110.0%) of the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate face amount of all Letters of Credit denominated in a Foreign Currency remaining undrawn, (plus, in each case, all interest, fees, and costs due or to become due in connection therewith (as estimated by Bank in its good faith business judgment)), to secure all of the Obligations relating to such Letters of Credit, as collateral security for the repayment of any future drawings under such Letters of Credit, and Borrower shall forthwith deposit and pay such amounts, and (ii) pay in advance all letter of credit fees scheduled to be paid or payable over the remaining term of any Letters of Credit; 
 (d)     terminate any FX Contracts; 
(e)    verify the amount of, demand payment of and performance under, and collect any Accounts and General Intangibles, settle or adjust disputes and claims directly with Account Debtors for amounts on terms and in any order that Bank considers advisable, and notify any Person owing Borrower money of Bank's security interest in such funds. Borrower shall collect all payments in trust for Bank and, if requested by Bank, immediately deliver the payments to Bank in the form received from the Account Debtor, with proper endorsements for deposit; 
(f)    make any payments and do any acts it considers necessary or reasonable to protect the Collateral and/or its security interest in the Collateral. Borrower shall assemble the Collateral if Bank requests and make it available as Bank designates. Bank may enter premises where the Collateral is located, take and maintain possession of any part of the Collateral, and pay, purchase, contest, or compromise any Lien which appears to be prior or superior to its security interest and pay all expenses incurred. Borrower grants Bank a license to enter and occupy any of its premises, without charge, to exercise any of Bank's rights or remedies; 
(g)    apply to the Obligations any (i) balances and deposits of Borrower it holds, or (ii) amount held by Bank owing to or for the credit or the account of Borrower; 
(h)    ship, reclaim, recover, store, finish, maintain, repair, prepare for sale, advertise for sale, and sell the Collateral. Bank is hereby granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free license or other right to use, without charge, Borrower's labels, Patents, Copyrights, mask works, rights of use of any name, trade secrets, trade names, Trademarks, and advertising matter, or any similar property as it pertains to the Collateral, in completing production of, advertising for sale, and selling any Collateral and, in connection with Bank's exercise of its rights under this Section, Borrower's rights under all licenses and all franchise agreements inure to Bank's benefit; 
(i)    place a "hold" on any account maintained with Bank and/or deliver a notice of exclusive control, any entitlement order, or other directions or instructions pursuant to any Control Agreement or similar agreements providing control of any Collateral; 
 (j)    demand and receive possession of Borrower's Books; and 
(k)    exercise all rights and remedies available to Bank under the Loan Documents or at law or equity, including all remedies provided under the Code (including disposal of the Collateral pursuant to the terms thereof). 
 
 
 -19- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9.2      Power of Attorney. Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints Bank as its lawful attorney-in-fact to: (a) exercisable following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, (i) sign Borrower's name on any invoice or bill of lading for any Account or drafts against Account Debtors; (ii) demand, collect, sue, and give releases to any Account Debtor for monies due, settle and adjust disputes and claims about the Accounts directly with Account Debtors, and compromise, prosecute, or defend any action, claim, case, or proceeding about any Collateral (including filing a claim or voting a claim in any bankruptcy case in Bank's or Borrower's name, as Bank chooses); (iii) make, settle, and adjust all claims under Borrower's insurance policies; (iv) pay, contest or settle any Lien, charge, encumbrance, security interest, or other claim in or to the Collateral, or any judgment based thereon, or otherwise take any action to terminate or discharge the same; (v) transfer the Collateral into the name of Bank or a third party as the Code permits; and (vi) receive, open and dispose of mail addressed to Borrower; and (b) regardless of whether an Event of Default has occurred, (i) endorse Borrower's name on any checks, payment instruments, or other forms of payment or security; and (ii) notify all Account Debtors to pay Bank directly. Borrower hereby appoints Bank as its lawful attorney-in-fact to sign Borrower's name on any documents necessary to perfect or continue the perfection of Bank's security interest in the Collateral regardless of whether an Event of Default has occurred until all Obligations have been satisfied in full and the Loan Documents have been terminated. Bank's foregoing appointment as Borrower's attorney in fact, and all of Bank's rights and powers, coupled with an interest, are irrevocable until all Obligations have been fully repaid and performed and the Loan Documen ts have been terminated. 
 9.3      Protective Payments. If Borrower fails to obtain the insurance called for by Section 6.7 or fails to pay any premium thereon or fails to pay any other amount which Borrower is obligated to pay under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or which may be required to preserve the Collateral, Bank may obtain such insurance or make such payment, and all amounts so paid by Bank are Bank Expenses and immediately due and payable, bearing interest at the then highest rate applicable to the Obligations, and secured by the Collateral. Bank will make reasonable efforts to provide Borrower with notice of Bank obtaining such insurance at the time it is obtained or within a reasonable time thereafter. No payments by Bank are deemed an agreement to make similar payments in the fut ure or Bank's waiver of any Event of Default. 
 9.4      Application of Payments and Proceeds. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Bank shall have the right to apply in any order any funds in its possession, whether from Borrower account balances, payments, proceeds realized as the result of any collection of Accounts or other disposition of the Collateral, or otherwise, to the Obligations. Bank shall pay any surplus to Borrower by credit to the Designated Deposit Account or to other Persons legally entitled thereto; Borrower shall remain liable to Bank for any deficiency. If Bank, directly or indirectly, enters into a deferred payment or other credit transaction with any purchaser at any sale of Collateral, Bank shall have the option, exercisable at any time, of either reducing the Obligations by the principal amount of the purchase price or deferring the reduction of the Obligations until the actual receipt by Bank of cash therefor. 
 9.5      Bank's Liability for Collateral. So long as Bank complies with reasonable banking practices regarding the safekeeping of the Collateral in the possession or under the control of Bank, Bank shall not be liable or responsible for: (a) the safekeeping of the Collateral; (b) any loss or damage to the Collateral; (c) any diminution in the value of the Collateral; or (d) any act or default of any carrier, warehouseman, bailee, or other Person. Borrower bears all risk of loss, damage or destruction of the Collateral. 
 9.6      No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. Bank's failure, at any time or times, to require strict performance by Borrower of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall not waive, affect, or diminish any right of Bank thereafter to demand strict performance and compliance herewith or therewith. No waiver hereunder shall be effective unless signed by the party granting the waiver and then is only effective for the specific instance and purpose for which it is given. Bank's rights and remedies under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are cumulative. Bank has all rights and remedies provided under the Code, by law, or in equity. Bank's exercise of one right or remedy is not an election and shall not preclude Bank from exercising any other remedy under this Agreement or other remedy available at law or in equity, and Bank's waiver of any Event of Default is not a continuing waiver. Bank's delay in exercising any remedy is not a waiver, election, or acquiescence. 
 
 
 -20- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9.7      Demand Waiver. Borrower waives demand, notice of default or dishonor, notice of payment and nonpayment, notice of any default, nonpayment at maturity, release, compromise, settlement, extension, or renewal of accounts, documents, instruments, chattel paper, and guarantees held by Bank on which Borrower is liable. 
 9.8      Borrower Liability. Either Borrower may, acting singly, request Credit Extensions hereunder.  Each Borrower hereby appoints the other as agent for the other for all purposes hereunder, including with respect to requesting Credit Extensions hereunder. Each Borrower hereunder shall be jointly and severally obligated to repay all Credit Extensions made hereunder, regardless of which Borrower actually receives said Advance, as if each Borrower hereunder directly received all Credit Extensions.  Each Borrower waives (a) any suretyship defenses available to it under the Code or any other applicable law, and (b) any right to require Bank to: (i) proceed against any Borrower or any other person; (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security; or (iii) pursue any other remedy.  Bank may exercise or not exercise any right or remedy it has against any Borrower or any security it holds (including the right to foreclose by judicial or non-judicial sale) without affecting any Borrower's liability.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or other related document, each Borrower irrevocably waives all rights that it may have at law or in equity (including, without limitation, any law subrogating Borrower to the rights of Bank under this Agreement) to seek contribution, indemnification or any other form of reimbursement from any other Borrower, or any other Person now or hereafter primarily or secondarily liable for any of the Obligations, for any payment made by Borrower with respect to the Obligations in connection with this Agreement or otherwise and all rights that it might have to benefit from, or to participate in, any security for the Obligations as a result of any payment made by Borrower with respect to the Obligations in connection with this Agreement or otherwise.  Any agreement providing for indemnification, reimbursement or any other arrangement prohibited under this Section 9.8 shall be null and void.  If any payment is made to a Borrower in contravention of this Section 9.8, such Borrower shall hold such payment in trust for Bank and such payment shall be promptly delivered to Bank for application to the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.
