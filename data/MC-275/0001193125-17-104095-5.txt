 RECITALS 
A. The Parties have previously entered into an Administrative Services Agreement dated August 3, 2011, which agreement was subsequently amended pursuant to (1) a First Amendment to Administrative Services Agreement dated October 3, 2011, (2) a "First Amendment to Administrative Services Agreement" dated June 20, 2012 which is considered by the Parties to be the "second amendment", and (3) an Amendment No. 3 to Administrative Services Agreement dated June 1, 2014 (as amended, the "CDA ASA"). 
B. Capitalized terms used but not specifically defined in this Amendment 4 shall have the meanings assigned to them in the CDA ASA. 
 C. The Parties now desire to amend the CDA ASA to reflect the terms set forth in this Amendment 4. 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the terms, conditions and provisions of this Amendment 4, their respective promises, each to the others, and other good and valuable considerati on, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows: 
 1. Section 1.2 of the CDA ASA is hereby amended and restated to read in its entirety as follows: 
 1.2  Term. The term of this Services Agreement shall be for a period commencing immediately upon the Effective Date and expiring on November 1, 2016 (the " Initial Term ");  provided, however, that upon expiration of the Initial Term, this Services Agreement shall renew and continue for successive  one-year  periods (each, a " Renewal Term"), unless the Company or ARIA gives the other party written notice of its intention not to renew not less than 30 days prior to expiration of the Initial Term or the then current  Renewal Term. In the event of  non-renewal, the expiration date of the expiring Initial Term or Renewal Term will be extended for 90 days to allow ARIA and the Company to effect an orderly transition of all  in-force  business to the Company. 
2. At all times while the CDA ASA remains in effect, ARIA agrees that it shall maintain sufficient numbers of experienced service, technology and operations personnel (e.g., employ ees, consultants, contractors, etc.) to ensure that all  in-force  business subject to the CDA ASA continues to be managed and administered effectively. 
3. Except as amended pursuant to this Amendment 4, the CDA ASA remains unchanged and in full force and effect.
