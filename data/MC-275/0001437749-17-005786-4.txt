In addition, subject to Section 12.1, if there shall occur any change in the capital structure or the business of the Company that is not a Section 4.2 Event (an "Other Extraordinary Event"), then the Committee, in good faith, may adjust any Award and make such other adjustments to the Plan as described in subsections (i) through (iv) above. 
   
Any adjustment pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be consistent with the applicable Section 4.2 Event or the applicable Other Extraordinary Event, as the case may be, and shall be executed in such manner as the Committee may deem appropriate to prevent substantial dilution of the rights granted to, or available for, Participants under the Plan. Any such adjustment determined by the Committee in good faith shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Company and all Participants and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and permitted assigns. Except as expressly provided in this Section 4.2 or in the applicable Award agreement, a Participant shall have no rights by reason of any Section  4.2 Event or any Other Extraordinary Event. 
   
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall not make any adjustments pursuant to this Section 4.2 that would (i) Cause an Award that is exempt from or otherwise not subject to Section 409A of the Code to be subject to Section 409A of the Code or (ii) with respect to an Award that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, subject a Participant to additio nal tax or penalties under Section 409A of the Code, without the Participant's consent.

 4.4   Minimum Restriction and Vesting Period. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee at grant, or if no rights of the Participant are reduced, thereafter, with respect to any Award of Restricted Stock, Performance Shares, Performance Units, or Other Stock-Based Award which by its terms does not require the recipient of the Award to pay a per share exercise price or purchase price equal to the Fair Market Value of the underlying Common Stock at the grant date, including restricted stock units (collectively, "Full-Value Awards"), (i) the Restriction Period with respect to any such Award of Restricted Stock, (ii) the Performance Period with respect to any such Award of Performance Shares, (iii) the Performance Cycle with respect to any such Award of Performance Units and (iv) the vesting period with respect to any such Other Stock-Based Award that is payable in shares of Common Stock granted on or after such date shall be no less than one year. In addition, unless otherwise determined by the Committee at grant, with respect to any Appreciation Award the vesting schedule shall be no less than one year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of the definition of Full Value Awards, dividend equivalent rights are not deemed to be Full-Value Awards. 
   
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
   
(a) the Committee may (at the time of grant or thereafter) provide for the earlier lapsing of restrictions or the vesting of any Award in the event of a Change in Control, a Participant's retirement, death or Disability, or a Participant's Termination by the Company without Cause or by the Participant for Good Reason, and 
   
(b) subject to the limitations set forth in Section 4.1(a), Awards may be granted that are not subject to the foregoing limitations (x) with respect to up to five percent (5%) of the total number of Shares reserved for Awards under the Plan and (y) in addition to the Awards permitted under the preceding clause (x), that are made as annual Awards to Non-Employee Directors or are made to Non-Employee Directors upon their initial election or appointment as a director. 
   
 
   
 19 
 
   
 
   
 4.5   Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, any rights granted hereunder to a Participant under an Award to receive or retain dividends or dividend equivalents with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying any Full-Value Award (with respect to which the lapsing of the restrictions subject thereto or the vesting thereof is based (in whole or in part) on the attainment of one or more Performance Goals), shall be subject to the same vesting and/or forfeiture conditions (performance-based, service-based or otherwise) as are applicable to such Full-Value Award.  However, dividend equivalent rights that are other Stock-Based Awards may be granted on a stand-alone basis.

 ARTICLE VI 
 STOCK OPTIONS 
   
 6.1   Options. Stock Options may be granted alone or in addition to other Awards granted under this Plan. Each Stock Option granted under this Plan shall be of one of two types: (a) an Incentiv e Stock Option or (b) a Non-Qualified Stock Option. 
   
 6.2   Grants. The Committee shall have the authority to grant to any Eligible Employee one or more Incentive Stock Options, Non-Qualified Stock Options, or both types of Stock Options. The Committee shall have the authority to grant any Consultant or Non-Employee Director one or more Non-Qualified Stock Options. 
   
To the extent that any Stock Option does not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option (whether because of its provisions or the time or manner of its exercise or otherwise), such Stock Option or the portion thereof which does not qualify shall constitute a separate Non-Qualified Stock Option. 
   
 6.3   Incentive Stock Options. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, no term of this Plan relating to Incentive Stock Options shall be interpreted, amended or altered, nor shall any discretion or authority granted under the Plan be so exercised, so as to disqualify the Plan under Section 422 of the Code, or, without the consent of the Participants affected, to disqualify  any Incentive Stock Option under such Section 422. 
   
 6.4   Terms of Options. Options granted under this Plan shall be subject to the following terms and conditions and shall be in such form and contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsisten t with the terms of this Plan, as the Committee shall deem desirable: 
   
 
 (a) 
 
Exercise Price. The exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to a Stock Option shall be determined by the Committee at the time of grant, provided that the per share exercise price of a Stock Option shall not be less than 100% (or, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent Stockholder, 110%) of the Fair Market Value of the Com mon Stock at the time of grant. 
 
 (b) 
 
Stock Option Term. The term of each Stock Option shall be fixed by the Committee, provided that no Stock Option shall be exercisable more than 10 years after the date the Option is granted; and provided further that the term of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent Stockholder shall not exceed five years. 
 
 (c) 
 
Exercisability. Stock Options shall be exercisable at such time or times and subject to such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Committee at grant. If the Committee provides, in its discretion, that any Stock Option is exercisable subject to certain limitations (including, without limitation, that such Stock Option is exercisable only in installments or within certain time periods), the Committee may waive such limitations on the exercisability at any time at or after grant in whole or in part (including, without limitation, waiver of the installment exercise provisions or acceleration of the time at which such Stock Option may be exercised), based on such factors, if any, as the Committee shall  determine, in its sole discretion. 
 
   
 
   
 21 
 
   
 
   
   
 The Option agreement may provide that 
(i)    in the event the Participant engages in Detrimental Activity prior to any exercise of the Stock Option, all Stock Options held by the Participant shall thereupon terminate a nd expire, 
(ii)  as a condition of the exercise of a Stock Option, the Participant shall be required to certify (or shall be deemed to have certified) at the time of exercise in a manner acceptable to the Company that the Participant is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Plan and that the Participant has not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in,  any Detrimental Activity, and 
(iii) in the event the Participant engages in Detrimental Activity during the one year period commencing on the date the Stock Option is exercised or becomes vested, the Company shall be entitled to recover from the Participant at any time within one year after such exercise or vesting, and the Participant shall pay over to the Company, an amount equal to an y gain realized as a result of the exercise (whether at the time of exercise or thereafter). 
If included in the Option Agreement, the foregoing provisions described in subsections (i), (ii) and (iii) shall cease to apply upon a Change in Control. 
 
 (d) 
 
Method of Exercise. Subject to whatever installment exercise and waiting period provisions apply under subsection (c) above, to the extent vested, Stock Options may be exercised in whole or in part at any time during the Option term, by giving written notice of exercise to the Committee (or its designee) specifying the number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased. Such notice shall be in a form acceptable to the Company and shall be accompanied by payment in full of the purchase price as follows: (i) in cash or by check, bank draft or money order payable to the order of the Company; (ii) solely to the extent permitted by applicable law, if the Committee authorizes, through a procedure whereby the Participant delivers irrevocable instructions to a broker reasonably acceptable to the Committee to deliver promptly to the Company an amount equal to the purchase price; (iii)  "Net-Exercise," which means a procedure by which the Optionee will be issued a number of shares of Stock determined in accordance with the following formula: N = X(A-B)/A, where "N" = the number of shares of Stock to be issued to the Participant upon exercise of the Option; "X" = the total number of shares with respect to which the Participant has elected to exercise the Option; "A" = the Fair Market Value of one share of Stock determined on the exercise date; and "B" = the exercise price per share (as defined in the Participant's Awa rd Agreement); (iv) cancellation of indebtedness; (v) on such other terms and conditions as may be acceptable to the Committee (including, without limitation, the relinquishment of Stock Options or by payment in full or in part in the form of Common Stock owned by the Participant (for which the Participant has good title free and clear of any liens and encumbrances) based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the payment date as determined by the Committee). No shares of Common Stock shall be issued until payment therefor, as provided herein, has been made or provided for. 
 
   
 
   
 22 
 
   
 
   
 
 (e) 
 
Non-Transferability of Options. No Stock Option shall be Transferable by the Participant otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and all Stock Options shall be exercisable, during the Participant's lifetime, only by the Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion, at the time of grant, or if no rights of the Participant are reduced, thereafter that a Non-Qualified Stock Option that is otherwise not Transferable pursuant to this Section is Transferable to a Family Member in whole or in part and in such circumstances, and under such conditions, as specified by the Committee. A Non-Qualified Stock Option that is Transferred to a Family Member pursuant to the preceding sentence (i) may not be subsequently Transferred otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and (ii) remains subject to the terms of this Plan and the applicable Award agreement. Any shares of Common Stock acquired upon the exercise of a Non-Qualified Stock Option by a permissible transferee of a Non-Qualified Stock Option or a permissible transferee pursuant to a Transfer after the exercise of the Non-Qualified Stock Option shall be subject to the terms of this Plan and the appl icable Award agreement. 
 
 (f) 
 
Termination by Death, Disability or Retirement. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, at the time of grant, or if no rights of the Participant are reduced, thereafter, if Participant's Termination is by reason of death, Disability or Retirement, all Stock Options that are held by such Participant that are vested and exercisable at the time of the Participant's Termination may be exercised by the Participant (or, in the case of death, by the legal representative of the Participant's estate) at any time within a period of one year from the date of such Termination, but in no event beyond the expiration of the stated term of such Stock Options;  provided, however, that in the case of Retirement, if the Participant dies within such exercise period, all unexercised Stock Options held by such Participant shall thereafter be exercisable, to the extent to which they were exercisable at the time of death, for a period of the later of one year from the date of such death or the expiration of the stated term of such Stock O ptions.

 (h) 
 
Voluntary Termination. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee at grant, or if no rights of the Participant are reduced, thereafter, if a Participant's Termination is voluntary (other than a voluntary termination described in subsection (i)(y) below), all Stock Options that are held by such Participant that are vested and exercisable at the time of the Participant's Termination may be exercised by the Participant at any time within a period of 90 days from the date of such Termination, but in no event beyond the expiration of the  stated term of such Stock Options. 
   
 
 (i) 
 
Termination for Cause. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee at grant, or if no rights of the Participant are reduced, thereafter, if a Participant's Termination (x) is for Cause or (y) is a voluntary Termination (as provided in subsection (h) above) after the occurrence of an event that would be grounds for a Termination for Cause, all Stock Options, whether vested or not vested, that are held by such Participant shall thereupon terminate and expire as of the date of such Termination. 
   
 
 (j) 
 
Unvested Stock Options. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee at grant, or if no rights of the Participant are reduced, thereafter, Stock Options that are not vested as of the date of a Participant's Termination for any reason shall terminate and expire as of the date of such Termination. 
   
 
 (k) 
 
Incentive Stock Option Limitations. To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the time of grant) of the Common Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by an Eligible Employee during any calendar year under this Plan and/or any other stock option plan of the Company, any Subsidiary or any Parent exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Non-Qualified Stock Options. If any provision of this Plan not be necessary in order for the Stock Options to qualify as Incentive Stock Options, or should any additional provisions be required, the Committee may amend this Plan accordingly, without the necessity of obtaining the approval of the st ockholders of the Company.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, an outstanding Option may not be modified to reduce the exercise price thereof nor may a new Option at a lower price be substituted for a surrendered Option (other than adjustments or substitutions in accordance with Section 4.2), unless such action is approved by the stockholders of the Company. 
   
 
 (m) 
 
Buyout and Settlement Provisions. The Committee may at any time offer to buy out an Option previously granted, based on such terms and conditions as the Committee shall establish a nd communicate to the Participant at the time that such offer is made;  provided that such purchase of an Option shall be based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of purchase and shall be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company to the extent required under the rules of any exchange or system on which the Company's securities are listed or traded at the request of the Company.
