The forwarding of such check or wire transfer shall constitute a payment of outstanding principal hereunder and shall satisfy and discharge the liability for principal on this Note to the extent of the sum represented by such check or wire transfer. Interest shall be payable in Common Stock (as defined below) pursuant to paragraph 4(b) herein. Permitted Assigns means any Holder assignment, transfer or sale of all or a portion of this Note accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel as provided for in Section 2(f) of the Securities Purchase Agreement. 
   
 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
   
 This Note is subject to the following additional provisions: 
   
1.       This Note is exchangeable for an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. No service charge will be made for such registration or transfer or exchange, except that Holder shall pay any tax or other governmental charges payable in connection therewith. To the extent that Holder subsequently transfers, assigns, sells or exchanges any of the multiple lesser denomination notes, Holder acknowledges that it will provide the Company with Opinio ns of Counsel as provided for in Section 2(f) of the Securities Purchase Agreement. 
   
2.       The Company shall be entitled to withhold from all payments any amounts required to be withheld under applicable laws. 
   
3.       This Note may be transferred or exchanged only in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (" Act"), applicable state securities laws and Sections 2(f) and 5(f) of the Securities Purchase Agreement. Any attempted transfer to a non-qualifying party shall be treated by the Company as void. Prior to due presentment for transfer of this Note, the Company and any agent of the Company may treat the person in whose name this Note is duly registered on the Company's records as the owner hereof for all other purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company nor any such agent shall be affected or bound by notice to the contrary. Any Holder of this Note electing to exercise the right of conversion set forth in Section 4(a) hereof, in addition to the requirements set forth in Section 4(a), and any prequalified prospective transferee of this Note, also is required to give the Company written confirmation that this Note is being converted (" Notice of Conversion ") in the form annexed hereto as  Exhibit A. The date of receipt (including receipt by telecopy) of such Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion Date. All notices of conversion will be accompanied by an Opinion of Coun sel. 
   
4.       (a)       The Holder of this Note is entitled, at its option, at any time commencing six months after the date of funding to the Company by the Holder, to convert all or any amount of the principal face amount of this Note then outstanding into shares of the Company's common stock (the " Common Stock ") at a price (" Conversion Price ") for each share of Common Stock equal to  62%  of the  lowest trading price of the Common Stock as reported on the National Quotations Bureau OTC Market exchange which the Company's shares are traded or any exchange upon which the Common Stock may be trad ed in the future (" Exchange "), for the  twenty-five prior trading days including the day upon which a Notice of Conversion is received by the Company (provided such Notice of Conversion is delivered together with an Opinion of Counsel, by fax or other electronic method of communication to the Company after 4 P.M. Eastern Standard or Daylight Savings Time if the Holder wishes to include the same day closing price). If the shares have not been delivered within 3 business days, the Notice of Conversion may be rescinded. Such conversion shall be effectuated by the Company delivering the shares of Common Stock to the Holder within 3 business days of receipt by the Company of the Notice of Conversion. Accrued, but unpaid interest shall be subject to conversion. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractions of shares will be issued on conversion, but the number of shares issuable shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. To the extent the Conversion Price of the Company's Common Stock closes below the par value per share, the Company will take all steps necessary to solicit the consent of the stockholders to reduce the par value to the lowest value possible under law. The Company agrees to honor all conversions submitted pending this increase. In the event the Company experiences a DTC "Chill" on its shares, the conversion price shall be decreased to 52% instead of 62% while that "Chill" is in effect. In no event shall the Holder be allowed to effect a conversion if such conversion, along with all other shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its aff iliates would exceed 9.9% of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock of the Company.

(e)        In case of any Sale Event (not to include a sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets) in connection with which this Note is not redeemed or converted, the Company shall cause effective provision to be made so that the Holder of this Note shall have the right thereafter, by converting this Note, to purchase or convert this Note into the kind and number of shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, capital reorganization or other change, consolidation or merger by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock that could have been purchased upon exercise of the Note and at the same Conversion Price, as defined in this Note, immediately prior to such Sale Event. The foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to successive Sale Events.

9.

13.       The Company will give the Holder direct notice of any corporate actions, including but not limited to name changes, stock splits, recapitalizations etc. This notice shall  be given to the Holder as soon as possible under law.
