 (c)      Leases. The Seller's interest in all leases, tenancies, licenses and other agreements for the use or occupancy of any portion of the Property in effect on the date of this Agreement and  all guaranties in connection therewith (the " Leases "); and

To the extent assignable, the Seller's interest in all leasing, service, supply and maintenance contracts relating to the Land, Improvements, or Personal Property (collectively,  the " Contracts"), but only to the extent Buyer elects to have such Contracts assigned to it in accordance with Section 5(c) hereof. 
 2.      Purchase Price; Deposit . The purchase price (the " Purchase Price") for the Property, subject to adjustments as provided in this Agreement, shall be SIXTEEN MILLION AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($16,000,000.00), and shall be paid as follows: 
 (a)      One Hundred Seventy-Five Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($175,000.00) (the " Initial Deposit") to be paid within two (2) business days after the Effective Date in immediately available funds and delivered to Chicago Title Insurance Company, 3700 Buffalo Speedway, Suite 40 0, Houston, TX 77098, Attention: Sue Jacobson, Phone: ( 713) 898-5000 , Facsimile: (713) 658-1029; Email: Sue.Jacobson@ctt.com (" Escrow Holder " or " Title Company ").

 3.      Disposition of Deposit; Defaults . 
 (a)      Held in Escrow. The Deposit shall be held in escrow and disbursed by Escrow Holder strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
 (b)      Upon Default . 
 (I)     If Buyer, without the right to do so and in default of its obligations under this Agreement, fails to complete Closing or otherwise defaults under or breaches this Agreement, Seller shall have the right to be paid the Deposit as liquidated damages. The parties have agreed that Seller's actual damages, in the event of a Buyer default would be extremely difficult or impracticable to determine. After negotiation, the parties have agreed that, considering all the circumstances existing on the date of this Agreement, the amount of the Deposit is a reasonable estimate of the damages that Seller would incur in such event. Each party specifically confirms the accuracy of the statements made above and the fact that each party was represented by counsel who explained, at the time this Agreement was made, the consequences of this liquidated damages provision. The right of Seller to be paid the Deposit shall be Seller's sole and exclusive remedy for Buyer's failure to purchase the Property or Buyer's breach of a representation or warranty. 
 (II)     If Seller, without the right to do so and in default of its obligations under this Agreement, fails to complete Closing or otherwise defaults under or materially breaches this Agreement, Buyer shall have the right to (i) terminate this Agreement, in which event Buyer shall be entitled to the return of the Deposit as its sole and exclusive remedy and neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any further obligations under this Agreement, except those matters expressly provided in this Agreement to survive termination, or (ii) institute a civil court action for specific performance (but not damages); provided that Buyer shall commence its action of specific performance against Seller within forty five (45) days after the scheduled Closing Date. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BUYER SEEK OR BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, SPECULATIVE OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, ALL OF WHICH BUYER SPECIFICALLY WAIVES, FROM SELLER FOR ANY BREACH BY SELLER OF ITS REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR COVENANTS OR ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. BUYER SPECIFICALLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO FILE ANY LIS PENDENS OR ANY LIEN AGAINST ANY PROPERTY UNLESS AND UNTIL IT HAS FILED AN ACTION SEEKING SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. 
 (c)      Upon Closing. If Closing is completed hereunder, Escrow Holder shall pay the Deposit to Seller as a credit against the Purchase Price. 
 (d)      Upon Termination by Buyer. If Buyer terminates this Agreement as a result of Seller's default or pursuant to the exercise of any right of termination permitted by this Agreement, upon the earlier to occur of: (i) receipt by Escrow Holder of written joint instructions from Seller and Buyer or (ii) entry of a final and unappealable adjudication determining which party is entitled to receive the Deposit, the Deposit shall be distributed in accordance with such written instructions or adjudication. 
 (e)      Hard Deposit. Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Initial Deposit shall be considered a "hard" deposit that is non-refundable to Buyer except as expressly set forth in this Section 3(e). Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Initial Deposit shall be paid to Seller upon any termination of this Agreement by either party;   provided ,   however, that Buyer shall be entitled to a return of the Initial Deposit in the case of a termination by Buyer: (I) under Section 3(b)(ii) (Seller Default), or (II) prior to expiration of the "Title, Survey, ESA Period" if Buyer is not satisfied with the Hard Deposit Due Diligence Deliveries in its sole discretion. For purposes of this Section, the "Hard Deposit Due Diligence Deliveries" shall mean: (i) the Title Commitment (as defined in Section 6(a)), together with copies of all documents referenced therein to the extent available in the public records; (ii) Seller's existing survey of the Property; and (iii) Seller's most recent environmental report(s) prepared for Seller with respect to the Property. Seller shall deliver to Buyer the Hard Deposit Due Diligence Deliveries within one (1) business day after the Effective Date. For purposes of this Section, the "Title, Survey, ESA Period" shall mean the period of time commencing on the Effective Date and expiring at 6:00 p.m. (Eastern) on the fifth (5 th) business day after Buyer's receipt of the Hard Deposit Due Diligence Deliveries. This provision shall survive termination of this Agreement. 
 4.      Closing . The consummation of the purchase and sale of the Property (the " Closing ") shall take place on or before   October 17, 2016   or at earlier date as mutually agreed to in writing by the parties (the " Closing Date"). The Closing shall be conducted through an escrow with the Escrow Holder, with escrow fees to be paid equally by Seller and Buyer. IT IS AGREED THAT TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall have the option to extend the Closing Date by up to fifteen (15) days, provided that at least three (3) business days prior to the then-scheduled Closing Date: (i) the option is exercised by delivery of a written extension notice to Seller, and (ii) an additional Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($50,000.00) is tendered to the Escrow Agent no later than 5:00 p.m. (Eastern), in which case such additional $50,000 shall be deemed part of the Deposit as defined above.         
 
 5.      Inspection and Title Review. 
 
 (a)      Inspection Period. Buyer and its authorized agents and representatives shall have the right to enter upon the Land and Improvements (including all of the apartment units, but subject to the rights of tenants under the Leases and in accordance with applicable law) at all reasonable times during normal business hours to inspect and conduct reasonably necessary inspections and tests on the Property at its sole cost and expense, including, without limitation, engineering and hazardous material inspections; provided, however, any intrusive physical testing will be conducted by Buyer only after obtaining Seller's prior written consent. The right granted in the immediately preceding sentence may be exercised during the period commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the earlier to occur of the Closing Date or termination of this Agreement. Buyer shall bear the cost of all inspections and tests, and Buyer shall give reasonable notice to the management of any inspection or test to be conducted on the Property. Buyer hereby indemnifies and holds Seller and the Property harmless as to all loss, property damage, bodily injury, cost or expense resulting from Buyer's inspections and tests of the Property, including, without limitation, claims for services rendered by third parties conducting such inspections and tests. Buyer shall also restore the Land and Improvements to the condition in which the same were found before any such entry upon the Property and inspection or examination was undertaken. Such agreement to repair and restore, and to indemnify and hold harmless Seller shall expressly survive closing or any termination of the Agreement. Buyer shall maintain, or shall cause its contractors to maintain, public liability and property damage insurance insuring Buyer (and naming Seller as an additional insured party) against any liability arising out of any entry or inspections of the Property or work performed about the Property pursuant to the provisions hereof and shall deliver certificates of insurance evidencing such coverage to Seller prior to any entry by Buyer or its contractors on the Property. 
 
 (b)      Document Review . Except as otherwise set forth in   Section 3(e)  above with respect to the timing for delivery of the Hard Deposit Due Diligence Deliveries, within three (3) business days after the Effective Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer ( or make available for inspection at the Property) copies of the items listed on   Schedule 5(b)  attached hereto and made a part hereof, but only to the extent such items are in Seller's possession or control (collectively, " Documents"); provided that Leases shall be available for inspection at the Property only. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, Seller makes no representations or warranties, either express or implied, and shall have no liability with respect to the accuracy or completeness of the information, data or conclusions contained in any information provided to Buyer, and Buyer shall make its own independent inquiry regarding the economic feasibility, physical condition and environmental state of the Property during the period beg inning on the Effective Date and ending at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern) on   September 16, 2016   (the " Inspection Period "). 
 (c)      Assignment or Termination of Contracts . Buyer shall assume all Contracts at Closing subject to this   Section 5(c). Prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period, Buyer may advise Seller in writing of any Contracts that it elects to have terminated upon Closing and Seller shall provide time ly notices of termination;   provided ,   however, that Seller shall not terminate, and Buyer expressly agrees to assume, all Contracts that are not cancellable by their terms or which cannot be terminated without cost or penalty to Seller. At Closing, Seller shall assign and Buyer shall assume all Contracts that have not terminated as of the Closing Date, including without limitation, any remaining rights and obligations under Contracts under which the notice required to terminate such Contracts, though delivered, will not have run prior to Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a ll existing agreements for management of the Property shall be terminated as of the Closing Date. 
 (d)      Right of Termination. If Buyer determines that the Property is not suitable in Buyer's sole discretion, then Buyer may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller on or before 6:00 p.m. (Eastern) on the last day of the Inspection Period and this Agreement shall be null and void for all purposes (except for provisions that expressly survive hereunder) and the Initial Deposit shall be paid to Seller (subject to Section 3(e)). In the event that Buyer does not deliver notice of termination of this Agreement prior to the expiration of the Inspection  Period, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived its right to terminate under this   Section 5(d)   and the Deposit shall be non-refundable to Buyer except in accordance with the terms of   Section 3(b)(ii)   above. 
 6.      Condition of Title . 
 (a)      Commitment to Insure. Within three (3) business days after the Effective Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a copy of Seller's Owner's Policy of title insurance and Buyer shall promptly order a commi tment from the Title Company (the " Title Commitment") to provide a standard owner's title insurance policy for the Property in an amount equal to the Purchase Price (the " Title Policy"); and (ii) Seller shall deliver to Buyer a copy the most recent ALTA/ACSM Land Title Survey of the Property in Seller's possession, if any (the " Existing Survey"). Buyer, at its option and expense, may obtain a new survey, or an update of the Existing Survey of the Real Property (the " Survey "). 
(b)    During the Inspection Period, Buyer shall review title to the Real Property as disclosed by the Title Commitment and, if obtained, the Survey. Seller shall have no obligation to cure title objections except to satisfy and remove liens of an ascertainable amount created by Seller, which liens Seller shall cause to be released at the Closing or affirmatively insured over by the Title Company. Seller further agrees to remove any exceptions or encumbrances to title which are created by Seller after the Effective Date of this Agreem ent without Buyer's written consent.  Buyer may terminate this Agreement under this Section 6(b) and receive a refund of the Deposit (i) at any time prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period, solely on account of a title or survey objection of Buyer set forth in written notice to Seller which title objection Seller has not agreed in writing to cure, (ii) if the Title Company revises the Title Commitment after the expiration of the Inspection Period to add or modify exceptions in a material adverse manner, if such additions or modifications are not acceptable to Buyer and are not removed by the Closing Date, or (iii) if Seller fails to cure a title objection that Seller is obligated to cure hereunder or has otherwise agreed to cure in writing .  Seller shall execute at Closing an affidavit as to authority, the rights of tenants in occupancy and the status of mechanics' liens (and sufficient to remove from the Title Policy any exception for mechanics' liens filed against the Real Property which relate to any matters occurring prior to the Closing Date) in form acceptable to Seller as the Title Company shall require for the issuance of the Title Policy. The Title Policy may be delivered after Closing if that is customary in the locality. 
 7.      Delivery of Possession. Actual sole and exclusive physical possession of the Property shall be given to Buyer at Closing unoccupied and free of any leases, claims to or rights of possession other than the rights of tenants under Leases by delivery of the keys to the Property and Seller's special or limited warranty deed (the " Deed ") in the form attached hereto as   Exhibit B , and Seller's bill of sale in the form of   Exhibit C   to this Agreement duly executed by Seller (the " Bill of Sale "). 
 8.      Apportionments. All property related items of income and expense, including but not limited to the following, shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer as of 11:59 p.m. on the day prior to t he Closing Date (the " Pro Ration Date ") as follows:

All real estate taxes, charges, and assessments affecting the Property (collectively, " Taxes") shall be prorated on a per diem basis as of the Pro Ration Date, applying any discount for early payment applicable as of the Pro Ration Date, and on the basis of the actual fiscal year for which such taxes are assessed, and Buyer shall assume liability for payment of Taxes accruing in the year in which Closing occurs.  In the event that the amount of Taxes for the current year is unknown at Closing, the Taxes shall be prorated based on the mill rate for taxes assessed for the immediately preceding year, taking into account the current appraised value for the Property issued by the County Appraisal District, and Buyer shall notify Seller of any necessary adjustment to such proration within thirty (30) days when correct tax figures are known, and thereafter any necessary adjustments shall be made. Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Seller has or may file appeals (the " Appeals") with respect to the current fiscal year and also with respect to prior year(s) ad valorem property taxes applicable to the Property (the " Appealed Taxes"). Seller shall be entitled, in Seller's sole discretion, to continue to pursue such Appeals after the Closing Date. In the event that any such Appeal is successful in reducing the amount of Appealed Taxes payable with respect to prior years, Seller shall be entitled to the full amount of any rebate, refund or reduction resulting from such Appeal. In the event that any such Appeal is successful in reducing the amount of Appealed Taxes payable with respect to the current fiscal year, Seller and Buyer shall prorate the net proceeds of any rebate, refund or reduction resulting from such Appeal relating to the current fiscal year, after payment of Seller's third party costs incurred in connection with the Appeal.  This provision shall expressly survive Closing and the recordation of the Deed. 
 (b)      Rents .     All lease payments, rentals and other income from the Property shall be prorated as of the Closing Date, Seller being charged and credited for all of same up to such date and Buyer being charged and credited for all of same on and after such date. No proration shall be made for delinquent rents existing as of the Closing Date. With respect to such delinquent rents, Buyer shall make a reasonable attempt to collect the same for Seller's benefit after the Closing Date in the usual course of operation of the Property and such collections, if any, less any cost of collection and any portion thereof attributable to any period prior to the Closing Date shall be remitted to the Seller promptly upon receipt by Buyer; provided, however, nothing contained herein shall require Buyer to institute any lawsuit or other collection procedures to collect such delinquent rents. All amounts collected from tenants owing delinquent rents shall be applied first to satisfy current rental periods and second to satisfy obligations arising from past rental periods, in inverse order of maturity. Buyer need not attempt to collect rent which is more than six (6) months' past due. At the Closing, Seller shall pay to Buyer in cash the amount of any prepaid rents paid to S eller by tenants for periods subsequent to the Closing Date .

Seller shall be responsible for all management company fees and leasing commissions applicable to the Property, and no proration shall be made of such fees and commissions. Seller shall terminate employees of such Seller engaged in the management of the Property effective as of the Closing Date and shall be responsible for severance pay, wages and benefits, if any, that may be due and owing to employees in connection with such termination or otherwise due to such employees .

 (e)      Utility Meter Readings. Seller shall obtain readings of the water, electric, gas and other utility meters servicing the Real Property (other than meters measuring exclusively utility consumption which is to be paid in full by tenants under Leases) to a date no sooner than two (2) days prior to the Closing Date. At or prior to Closing, Seller shall pay all charges based upon such meter readings, adjusted to include a reasonable estimate of the additional charges due for the period from the dates of the respective readings until the Closing Date. If Seller is unable to obtain readings of any meters prior to the Closing Date, Closing shall be completed without such readings and upon the obtaining thereof, Seller shall pay the charges incurred prior to the Closing Date as reasonably determined by both Buyer and Seller based upon such readings, and at Closing, Seller shall deposit with the Title Company an amount  reasonably estimated to represent the anticipated obligation of Seller under this sentence. 
 (f)      RUBS. In addition to any other prorations described in this Agreement, any ratio utility billing systems (" RUBS") applicable to the Property, for the following categories of utilities and other reimbursements: (i) electricity, (ii) gas, (iii) water / sewer, (iv) trash, (v) pest control and (vi) other, attributable to the uncollected or trailing collections two calendar months prior to Closing will be reflected as a credit to Seller at Closing and will be calculated for closing purposes on the uncollected or trailing collections monthly periods based on the monthly average actual trailing RUBS for six months prior to Closing according to the income statements prepared by Seller and provided to Buyer.  A subsequent cash adjustment of RUBS between Seller and Buyer will be made when actual figures are available, but in all events within 90 days after the Closing Date.  Seller and Buyer each agree to provide such information as the other may reasonably request regarding RUBS and the billing, collectio n, and payment thereof. 
 (g)      True-up. Subsequent to the Closing, if at any time during the 30-day period following Closing the actual amount of any pro-rated items that were based upon estimations at Closing, including without limitation, utilities and other operating expenses with respect to the Property for the month in which the Closing occurs, are determined, the parties agree to adjust the proration of utilities and other operating expenses and, if necessary, to refund or repay such sums as shall be necessary to effect such adjustment. For clarification, this Section 8(g) shall not apply to Taxes, Rents or RUBS which shall be pro-rated and paid under Sections 8(a), 8(b) and 8(f) respectively. This provision shall survive Closing and recordat ion of the Deed.

 (a)      Notice Regarding Possible Liability for Additional Taxes. If for the current ad valorem tax year the taxable value of the Property that is the subject of this Agreement is determined by a special appraisal method that allows for appraisal of the Property at less than its market value, the Buyer may not be allowed to qualify the Property for that special appraisal in a subsequent tax year and the Property may then be appraised at its full market value. In addition, the transfer of the Property or a subsequent change in the use of the Property may result in the imposition of an additional tax plus interest as a penalty for the transfer or the change in the use of the Property. The taxable value of the Property and the applicable method of appraisal for the current tax  year is public information and may be obtained from the Bexar County Appraisal District. 
 (b)      Notice Regarding Possible Annexation. If the Property that is the subject of this Agreement is located outside the limits of a municipality, the Property may now or later be included in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a municipality and may now or later be subject to annexation by the municipality. Each municipality maintains a map that depicts its boundaries and extraterritorial jurisdiction. To determine if the Property is located within a municipality's extraterritorial jurisdiction or is likely to be located within a municipality's extraterritorial jurisdiction, contact all municipalities located in the general proximity of the Property for further information. 
 (c)      Property Located in a Certificated Service Area of a Utility Service Provider. The Property that you are about to purchase may be located in a certificated water or sewer service area, which is authorized by law to provide water or sewer service to the properties in the certificated area. If the Property is located in a certificated area there may be special costs or charges that you will be required to pay before you can receive water or sewer service. There may be a period required to construct lines or other facilities necessary to provide water or sewer service to the Property. You are advised to determine if the Property is in a certificated area and contact the utility service provider to determine the cost that you will be required to pay and the period, if any, that is required  to provide water or sewer service to the Property. 
 (d)      Notice Regarding District. If the Property is situated in a utility or other statutorily created district providing water, sewer, drainage, or flood control facilities and services, Chapter 49, Texas Water Code, requires Seller to deliver and Buyer to sign the statutory notice relating to the tax rate, bonded indebtedness, or standby fees of the district before final execution of th is Agreement.

 (f)      Lead Disclosure. If apartments or other residential units are on the Property and the units were built before 1978, federal law requires a lead-based paint and hazard disclosure statement to be m ade part of this Agreement.
