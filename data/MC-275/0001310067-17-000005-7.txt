 Section 2.11     Mandatory Reduction of L/C Commitments.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Required L/C Lenders may decline or waive (in their sole discretion) any required reduction of the L/C Commitments pursuant to this   Section 2.11   on account of all L/C Lenders and Issuing Bank. 
 Section 2.12     Increased Costs. (a) If, due to either (i) after the Effective Date the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) made or issued after the Effective Date, there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to issue, participate in, fund or maintain, or issuing, participating in, funding or maintaining Letters of Credit (excluding for purposes of thi s   Section 2.12   any such increased costs resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which   Section 2.15  shall govern) and (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or by the foreign jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such Lender is organized or has its Applicable Office or any political subdivision thereof), then the Borrowers shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost;   provided   that a Lender claiming additional amounts under this   Section 2.12(a)  agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Office and/or take other commercially reasonable action if the making of such a designation or the taking of such actions would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such increased cost that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrowers and the Agent by such Lender, shall be entitled to a presumption of correctness. If any Borrower so notifies the Agent after any L/C Lender notifies the Borrowers of any  increased cost pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this   Section 2.12(a), such Borrower may, upon payment of such increased cost to such L/C Lender, replace such L/C Lender with a Person that is an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the terms of   Section 9.16  (and the L/C Lender being so replaced shall take all action as may be necessary to assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to such Eligible Assignee).

(b) If any Lender determines that compliance with any change after the Effective Date in law or regulation or any guideline or request after the Effective Date from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would affect the amount of capital or liquidity required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any entity controlling such Lender and that the amount of such capital or liquidity is increased by or based upon the existence of such Lender's commitment hereunder and other commitments of this type, then, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the Borrowers shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or such entity in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital or liquidity to be allocable to the existence of such Lender's commitment hereunder. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Borrowers and the Agent by such Lender shall be entitled to a presumption of correctness. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives thereunder issued in connection therewith or in implementation thereof and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case be deemed to be a change in law covered by this   Section 2.12   regardless of the date enacted, adopted, issued or implemented. 
(c) The Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or capital, liquidity or reserve requirement or pursuant to   Section 2.15  for any Taxes incurred more than six months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrowers of the change or issuance giving rise to such increased costs or capital, liqu idity or reserve requirement or Tax and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor;   provided  that if the change or issuance giving rise to such increased costs or capital, liquidity or reserve requirement or Tax is retroactive, then the six-month period referred to above s hall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. 
 Section 2.13     [Reserved ]. 
 Section 2.14     Payments and Computations . 
(a)    The Borrowers shall make each payment hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, without any right of counterclaim or set-off, not later than 2:00 P.M. on the day when due in U.S. dollars to the Agent at the Agent's Account in same day funds. The Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal  or interest or commitment fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to   Section 2.12   or   2.15) to the applicable L/C Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and rec ording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to   Section 9.07(c), from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the other Loan Documents in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the L/C Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and 
 
 
 37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves. 
(b)    Each Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender, if and to the extent payment owed by it to such Lender is not made when due hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, to charge from time to time against any or all of such Borrower's accounts with such Lender any amount so due. Any such Lender so charging such accounts shall deliver the proceeds therefrom to the Agent for distribution to the Credit Parties in the manner set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. 
(c)    All computations of interest based on the Base Rate shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the Federal Funds Rate and of letter of credit fees, commitment fees and other fees shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or commitment fees are payable. Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
(d)    Whenever any payment hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or commitment fee, as the case may be. 
(e)    Unless the Agent shall have received notice from any Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due by it to the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that the applicable Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each applicable Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. 
 Section 2.15     Taxes . 
(a)    Any and all payments by the Borrowers to or for the account of any Recipient hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or any other documents to be delivered hereunder sha ll be made, in accordance with   Section 2.14  or the applicable provisions of such other documents, free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future Taxes (except as required by applicable law). If the Borrowers and/or Agent shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any other documents to be delivered hereunder to any Recipient, (i) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions for Indemnified Taxes (including deductions for Indemnified Taxes applicable to additional sums payable under this   Section 2.15) such Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions of Indemnified Taxes been made, (ii) the Borrowers and/or 
 
 
 38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Agent shall make such deductions as are determined by such Borrowers and/or Agent to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to   Sections 2.15(e)   and   (f)  and (iii) the Borrowers and/or Agent shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. 
(b)    In addition, the Borrowers shall pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or under the other Loan Documents or from the execution, delivery or registration of, performing under, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any other documents to be delivered hereunder, but excluding any such taxes that are Other Connection Taxes imposed with respect to an assignment (other than an assignment  made pursuant to   Section 9.16 ) (hereinafter referred to as " Other Taxes"). Other Taxes shall not include any Taxes imposed on, or measured by reference to, gross income, net income or gain. 
 (c)    Without duplication of any additional amounts paid pursuant to   Section 2.15(a), the Borrowers shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient for and hold it harmless against the full amount of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Tax es or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any Governmental Authority on amounts payable under this   Section 2.15) imposed on or paid by such Recipient or withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any liability (including penalties, interest and reasonable expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Recipient or the Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor. 
(d)    Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Indemnified Taxes, the Borrowers shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in   Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment to the extent such a receipt is issued therefor, or other written proof of payment thereof that is reasonabl y satisfactory to the Agent. 
(e)    Any Lender or other Recipient that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender or other Recipient, if reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Agent as will enable the Borrowers or the Agent to determine whether or not such Lender or other Recipient is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. 
 (i)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: 
(1)    each Lender that is a United States person (or is a disregarded entity within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3 of a United States person), on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender, and from time to time thereafter  as reasonably requested in writing by the Borrowers or the Agent, 
 
 
 39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
shall provide each of the Agent and the Borrowers with two executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 certifying that such Lender (or, in the case or a disregarded entity, its owner) is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax on payments pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; and 
(2)    each Lender that is not a United States person (and is not a disregarded entity within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3 of a United States person): 
(A) on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the Borrowers (but only so long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the Agent and the Borrowers with two executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI, as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender (or, in the case of a disregarded entity, its owner) is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax on payments purs uant to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; and 
(B) on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this Agreement and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in writing by the Borrowers (but only so long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the Agent and the Borrowers with executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax, duly completed, together with supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrowers or the Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made. 
If the form provided by a Lender or other Recipient at the time such Lender or other Recipient first becomes a party to this Agreement (or, with respect to a Lender, changes its Applicable Office) indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero (or if no form is provided at such time), withholding tax at such rate (or, respectively, at the maximum rate) shall be considered excluded from Indemnified Taxes unless and until such Lender or other Recipient provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Indemnified Taxes for periods governed by such form;   provided ,   however, that, if at the date of the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender assignee becomes a party to this Agreement, the Lender assignor was entitled to payments under   Section 2.15(a)  in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Indemnified Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in Indemnified Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Lender assi gnee on such date. If any form or document referred to in this   Section 2.15(e)  requires the disclosure of information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 BEN, W-8BEN-E, or W-8ECI, that the Lender or other Recipient reasonably considers to be 
 
 
 40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
confidential, the Lender or other Recipient shall give notice thereof to the Borrowers and shall not be obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information.  For purposes of this   Section 2.15(e) , the terms " United States " and " United States person " shall have the meanings specified in Section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
(f)    For any period with respect to which a Lender or other Recipient has failed to provide the Borrowers with the appropriate form, certificate or other document described in   Section 2.15(e)   ( other   than  if such failure is due to a change in law, or in the interpretation or application thereof, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form, certificate or other document originally was required to be provided, or if such form, certificate or other document otherwise is not required under   Section 2.15(e) ), such Lender or other Recipient shall not be entitled to indemnification under   Section 2.15(a)   or   (c)   with respect to Indemnified Taxes imposed by the United States by reason of such failure;   provided ,   however, that should a Lender or other Recipient become subject to Indemnified Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form, certificate or other document required hereunder, the Borrowers shall take such steps as the Lender or other Recipient shall reasonably request to assist the Lender or other Recipient to recover such Indemnified Taxes. Further, if a payment made to a Lender or other Recipient under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender or other Recipient were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender or other Recipient shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender or other Recipient has complied with such Lender's or other Recipient's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (f), "FATCA" sha ll include any amendments made to FATCA after the Effective Date. 
(g)    Each Lender and other Recipient agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this   Section 2.15  expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrowers and the Agent in writing of its legal inabilit y to do so. 
 (h)    Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to this   Section 2.15  agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be o therwise disadvantageous to such Lender. 
(i)    If any Lender or other Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has actually and finally realized, by reason of a refund, a deduction or  credit of any Indemnified Taxes paid or reimbursed by the Borrowers pursuant to   Section 2.15(a)   or   Section 2.15(c)  above in respect of payments under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, a current monetary benefit that it would otherwise not have obtained, and 
 
 
 41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 that would result in the total payments under this   Section 2.15  exceeding the amount needed to make such Lender or other Recipient whole, such Lender or other Recipient shall pay to the Borrowers, with reasonable promptness following the date on which it actually realizes such benefit, an amount equal to the amount of such excess, net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Lender or other Recipient reasonably allocable in securing such refund, deduction or credit and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrowers, upon the request of such Lender or other Recipient, agree to repay the amount paid over to the Borrowers to such Lender or other Recipient (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event such Lender or other Recipient is required to repay such refund to such jurisdiction. Nothin g in this   Section 2.15(i)  shall be construed to require any Lender or other Recipient to make available to the Borrowers or any other Person its tax returns or any confidential tax information. 
(j)    If the Agent or any Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, shall become aware that it is entitled to claim a refund from a Governmental Authority in respect of Indem nified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by Borrower pursuant to this   Section 2.15, including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by Borrower, or with respect to which Borrower or a Group Member that is a signatory hereto has pai d additional amounts pursuant to this   Section 2.15, it shall notify Borrower of the availability of such refund claim and, if the Agent or any Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, determines in good faith that making a claim for refund will not have any adverse consequence to its taxes or business operations, shall, after receipt of a request by Borrower, make a claim to such Governmental Authorit y for such refund at Borrower's expense. 
 Section 2.16     Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any L/C Lender shall obtain any payment from any Group Member (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Re imbursement Obligations or other amounts owing to it (other than pursuant to   Section 2.12   or   2.15) in excess of its ratable share, such L/C Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other L/C Lenders such participations or other amounts owing to them as shall be necessary to ca use such purchasing L/C Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them;   provided ,   however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing L/C Lender, such purchase from each L/C Lender shall be rescinded and such L/C Lender shall repay to the purchasing L/C Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such L/C Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such L/C Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing L/C Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing L/C Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrowers agree that any L/C Lender so purchasing a participation from another L/C Lender pursuant  to this   Section 2.16  may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such L/C Lender w ere the direct creditor of the Borrowers in the amount of such participation. 
 Section 2.17     Increase of L/C Commitments. At any time and from time to time, upon the request of the Borrowers and with notice to the Agent and the Issuing Bank, any L/C Lender may increase its L/C Commitment by electing (in its sole discretion) to deposit or cause to be deposited into the Lender Cash Collateral Account of such L/C Lender an amount equal to 
 
 
 42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 102% of such increase;   provided , in no event shall the aggregate L/C Commitments exceed the Facility Cap,   provided ,   further , that each increase after the Effective Date shall be in increments of not less than $25,000,000.

Each L/C Lender agrees with the Issuing Bank that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank for which the Issuing Bank is not reimbursed in full by the Borrowers in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Lender shall pay to the Issuing Bank upon demand at the Issuing Bank's address for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Lender's L/C Commitment Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereo f, that is not so reimbursed, provided that (x) in lieu of making any demands under this   Section 3.04(a), the Issuing Bank may withdraw funds from such L/C Lender's Lender Cash Collateral Account; or (y) so long as funds sufficient to pay such amount are in such L/C Lender's Lender Cash Collateral Account and are available to the Issuing Bank without stay or delay, such L/C Lender may satisfy any demands made under this   Section 3.04(a)  by the Issuing Bank, by directing the Issuing Bank to withdraw funds from such L/C Lender's Lender Cash Collateral Account, in each case, to satisfy such payment obligations in accordance with Section 4 of the Cash Collateral Agreement. The Issuing Bank shall give prompt notice of such withdrawal in accordance with the Cash Collateral Agreement. Each L/C Lender's obligation to pay such amount shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such L/C Lender may have against the Issuing Bank, the Borrowers or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default  or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in   Article IV, (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Borrowers, any other Loan Party or any other Lender or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the

 Section 3.06     Obligations Absolute . Each Borrower's obligations under this   Article III  shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment that any Borrower may have or have had against the Issuing Bank, any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit or any other Person. Each Borrower also agrees with the Issuing Bank that the Issuing Bank shall not be responsible for,  and such Borrower's Reimbursement Obligations under   Section 3.05  shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among such Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of such Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee. The Issuing Bank shall not be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuing Bank that issued such Letter of Credit.

 47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(a)    The Agent or the Issuing Bank, as applicable, shall determine the Spot Rates as of each Revaluation Date to be used for calculating Dollar Equivalent amounts of Letters of Credit and other Obligations denominated in Alternative Currencies. Such Spot Rates shall become effective as of such Revaluation Date and shall be the Spot Rates employed in converting any amounts between the applicable currencies until the next Revaluation Date occurs. Except for purposes of financial statements delivered by Loan Parties hereunder or calculating financial covenants hereunder or except as otherwise provided herein, the applicable amount of any Alternative Currency for purposes of the Loan Documents shall be such Dollar Equivalent amount as determined by the Agent or the Issuing Bank, as applicable, in accordance with the first sentence of this   clause (a). The Borrowers and the L/C Lenders will be promptly informed of the results of such calculations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, where the permissibility of a transaction or determinations of required actions or circumstances (excluding in connection with the matters referred to in   clause (b)  below) depend upon compliance with, or are determined by reference to, amounts stated in Dollars, such amounts shall be deemed to refer to Dollars or Dollar Equivalents and any requisite currency translation shall be based on the Spot Rate, and the permissibility of actions taken under   Section 6.02   shall not be affected by subsequent fluctuations in exchange rates;   provided  that if Permitted Refinancing Debt is incurred to refinance other Debt, and such Permitted Refinancing Debt would cause the applicable Dollar denominated limitation to be exceeded if calculated at the Spot Rate in effect on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of such refinancing, such Dollar denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of Permitted Refinancing Debt does not exceed the principal amount of such Debt being refinanced except as permitted hereunder. 
(b)    Wherever in this Agreement in connection with any payment of any Obligations or the issuance, amendment or extension of a Letter of Credit, an amount, such as a required minimum or multiple amount, is expressed in Dollars, but such Obligation or Letter of Credit is denominated in an Alternative Currency, such amount shall be the relevant Alternative Currency Equivalent of such Dollar amount (rounded to the nearest unit of such Alternative Currency, with 0.5 of a unit being rounded upward), as determined by the Agent or the Issu ing Bank, as the case may be. 
 Section 3.11     Borrowers Cash Collateral .

 (ii)    an Event of Default set forth under Section 7.01(e) occurs and is continuing; 
(iii)    for any reason, any Letter of Credit is outstanding at the time of termination in full of the L/C Commitments and backstop Satisfactory Letters of Credit are not in place; 
 
 
 48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(iv)    for any reason, any Letter of Credit is outstanding at the time that the aggregate L/C Lender Exposure exceed the L/C Commitments (including as a result of a reduction purs uant to Section 2.11) and backstop Satisfactory Letters of Credit are not in place; or 
(v)    any Letter of Credit is outstanding at the time the Existing Credit Agreement or the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement is terminated, replaced or refinanced and backstop Sa tisfactory Letters of Credit are not in place, 
then the Borrowers shall at such time deposit in a cash collateral account maintained by the Agent, an amount equal to 102% of the aggregate L/C Lender Exposure (or, in the case of clause (iv), 102% of the amount of such excess), and shall do so not later than 2:00 P.M. on (x) in the case of the immediately preceding clause (i), (iii) or (iv), (1) the first Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrowers receives notice thereof, if such notice is received on such day prior to 12:00 noon or (2) if clause (1) above does not apply, the second Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrowers receive such notice and (y) in the case of the immediately preceding clause (ii) or (v), the Business Day on which an Event of Default set forth under Section 7.01(e) occurs or, if such day is not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately succeeding such day. 
(b)    The Borrowers hereby grant to the Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Lenders, a security interest in all cash collateral accounts established pursuant to Section 3.11(a), and all cash deposited and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing. Cash collateral held by the Agent pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant to Article VII) may be invested in cash equivalents selected by the Agent in its sole discretion. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit as cash collateral, such funds shall be applied, to the extent permitted under applicable Requirements of Law, to reimburse the Issuing Bank, or, to the extent any L/C Lender has paid the Issuing Bank in respe ct of any amounts not reimbursed by the Borrowers pursuant to   Section 3.04(a), to reimburse the L/C Lenders. To the extent the amount of any such cash collateral exceeds the then current amount of all L/C Lender Exposure and so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the excess shall be refunded to the Borrowers. In the case of clause (i) or (ii) above, if such Event of Default is cured or waived and no other Event of Default is then occurring and continuing, the amount of any such cash collateral shall be refunded to the Borrowers. 
 Section 3.12     Replacement and Cancellation of Letters of Credit. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, to the extent that the Issuer Exposure exceeds the Aggregate L/C Commitments at any time , whether as a result of   Section 2.11, the occurrence of the L/C Termination Date, or otherwise, and regardless of whether there are backstop Satisfactory Letters of Credit, the Borrowers shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause a replacement letter of credit to be issued, or other credit support or collateral to be provided to the applicable beneficiaries thereof and cause the Letters of Credit to be returned to the Issuing Bank and cancelled, such that after giving effect to all returns and cancellations pursuant to this sentence, the Issuer Exposure does not e xceed the Aggregate L/C Commitments.

 Section 8.09     Agent in Its Individual Capacity. The Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with any Loan Party as though the Agent were not an Agent.

If no successor agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Agent, the Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Required L/C Lenders and the Borrowers (unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing), a successor agent from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent hereunder, such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Agent, and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon such appointment and 
 
 
 78 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
approval, and the former Agent's rights, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of Reimbursement Obligations. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Agent by the date that is 30 days following a retiring Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the Agent hereunder, until such time, if any, as the Required L/C Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above. After any retiring Agent's resignation as Agent, the provisions of this   Article VIII   and   Sections 9.04 ,   9.09 ,   9.11   and   9.12  shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
