Each Disposition of all or substantially all of a line of business, and each Acquisition (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Danish Acquisition), by the Company and its Subsidiaries that is consummated during any Measurement Period shall, for purposes of determining compliance with the financial covenants set forth in Section 7.11 and for purposes of determining the Applicable Rate, be given Pro Forma Effect as of the first day of such Measurement Period.

 1.04 Rounding . 
Any financial ratios required to be maintained by the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement shall be calculated by dividing the appropriate component by the other component, carrying the result to one place more than the number of places by which such ratio is expressed herein and rounding the result up or down to the nearest number (with a  rounding-up  if there is no nearest number). 
   
 1.05 Times of Day; Rates . 
Unless otherwise specified, all references herein to times of day shall be references to Eastern time (daylight or standard, as applicable). 
The Lender does not warrant, nor accept responsibility, nor shall the Lender have any liability with respect to the administration, submission or any other matter related to the rates in the definition of "Eurocurrency Rate" or with respect to any comparable or successor rate thereto. 
   
 1.06 Letter of Credit Amounts . 
Unless otherwise specified herein, the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the stated amount of such Letter of Credit in effect  at such time;  provided,   however, that with respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the terms of any Issuer Document related thereto, provides for one or more automatic increases in the stated amount thereof, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be the Dollar Equivalent of the maximum stated amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such inc reases, whether or not such maximum stated amount is in effect at such time. 
   
 1.07 UCC Terms . 
Terms defined in the UCC in effect on the Closing Date and not otherwise defined herein shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, have the meanings provided by those definitions. Subject to the foregoing, the term "UCC" refers, as of any date of determination, to the UCC then in effect. 
   
 1.08 Exchange Rates; Currency Equivalents . 
(a)    The Lender shall determine the Spot Rates as of each Revaluation Date to be used for calculating Dollar Equivalent amounts of Credit Extensions and Outstanding Amounts denominated in Alternative Currencies. Such Spot Rates shall become effective as of such Revaluation Date and shall be the Spot Rates employed in converting any amounts between the applicable currencies until the next Revaluation Date to occur. Except for purposes of financial statements delivered by Loan Parties hereunder or calculating financial covenants hereunder or except as otherwise provided herein, the applicable amount of any currency (other than Dollars) for purposes of the Loan Documents shall be such Dollar Equivalent amount as  so determined by the Lender. 
(b)    Wherever in this Agreement in connection with a Borrowing, conversion, continuation or prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or the issuance, amendment or extension of a Letter of Credit, an amount, such as a required minimum or multiple amount, is expressed in Dollars, but such Borrowing, Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Letter of Credit is denominated in an Alternative Currency, such amount shall be the relevant Alternative Currency Equivalent of such Dollar amount (rounded to the nearest unit of such Alternative Currency, with 0.5  of a unit being rounded upward), as determined by the Lender. 
   
 34 
 
 
 1.09 Additional Alternative Currencies . 
(a)    The Company may from time to time request that Eurocurrency Rate Loans be made and/or Letters of Credit be issued in a currency other than those specifically listed in the d efinition of "Alternative Currency";  provided that (i) such requested currency is an Eligible Currency and (ii) such requested currency shall only be treated as a "LIBOR Quoted Currency" to the extent that there is published LIBOR rate for such currency. In the case of any such request with respect to the making of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, such request shall be subject to the approval of the Lender, and in the case of any such request with respect to the issuance of Letters of Credit, such request shall be subject to the approval of the Lender. 
(b)    Any such request shall be made to the Lender not later than 11:00 a.m., twenty (20) Business Days prior to the date of the desired Credit Extension (or such other time or da te as may be agreed by the Lender in its sole discretion). 
(c)    If the Lender consents to making Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Letters of Credit in such requested currency and the Lender reasonably determines that an appropriate interest rate is available to be used for such requested currency, the Lender shall so notify the Company and may amend the definition of Eurocurrency Rate for any  Non-LIBOR Quoted Currency to the extent necessary to add the applicable Eurocurrency Rate for such currency and (ii) to the extent the definition of Eurocurrency Rate reflects the appropriate interest rate for such currency or has been amended to reflect the appropriate rate for such currency, such currency shall thereupon be deemed for all purposes to be an Alternative Currency for purposes of any Borrowings of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or the issuance of Letters of Credit, as applicable. 
   
 1.10 Change of Currency . 
(a)    Each obligation of the Borrowers to make a payment denominated in the national currency unit of any member state of the European Union that adopts the Euro as its lawful currency after the date hereof shall be redenominated into Euro at the time of such adoption. If, in relation to the currency of any such member state, the basis of accrual of interest expressed in this Agreement in respect of that currency shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the London interbank market for the basis of accrual of interest in respect of the Euro, such expressed basis shall be replaced by such convention or practice with effect from the date on which such member state adopts the Euro as its lawful cur rency;  provided that if any Borrowing in the currency of such member state is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect, with respect to such Borrowing, at th e end of the then current Interest Period. 
(b)    Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Lender may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect the adoption of the Euro by any member state of the European Union and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to the Euro. 
(c)    Each provision of this Agreement also shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Lender may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect a change in currency of any other country and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to the change in currency.

The Term Borrowing shall consist of a Term Loan made by the Lender. The Term Borrowing repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. The Term Loan shall be a Eurocurre ncy Rate Loan;  provided ,  however, any Term Borrowing made on the Closing Date or any of the three (3) Business Days following the Closing Date shall only be made in the event Danish Borrower delivers a Funding Indemnity Letter not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the date of such Term Borrowing.

Within the limits of the Revolving Commitment, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the U.S. Borrower may borrow Revolving Loans, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.01(b). Revolving Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurocu rrency Rate Loans, as further provided herein;  provided,   however, any Revolving Borrowings made on the Closing Date or any of the three (3) Business Days following the Closing Date shall be made as Base Rate Loans unless the U.S. Borrower delivers a Funding Indemnity Letter not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the date of such Revolving Borrowing. 
   
 2.02 Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Loans . 
 (a)     Notice of Borrowing. Each Borrowing, each conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be made upon the applicable Borrower's irrevocable not ice to the Lender, which may be given by (A) telephone or (B) a Loan Notice;  provided that any telephonic notice must be confirmed immediately by delivery to the Lender of a Loan Notice. Each such notice must be received by the Lender not later than 11:00 a.m. (i) three (3) Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars or of any conversion of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars to Base Rate Loans, (ii) four (4) Business Days (or five (5) Business Days in the case of a Special Notice Currency) prior to the requested date of any Borrowing or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies, and (iii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans;  provided ,  however, that if a Borrower wishes to request Eurocurrency Rate Loans having an Interest Period other than one (1), two (2) or three (3) months in duration as provided in the definition of "Interest Period", the applicable notice must be received by the Lender not later than 11:00 a.m. (i) four (4) Business Days prior to the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars, or (ii) five (5) Business Days (or six (6) Business Days in the case of a Special Notice Currency) prior to the requested date of such Borrower, conversion or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies. Not later than 
   
 36 
 
 
11:00 a.m., (i) three (3) Business Days before the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars, or (ii) four (4) Business Days (or five (5) Business Days in the case of a Special Notice Currency) prior to the requested date of such Borrower, conversion or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies, the Lender shall notify the Borrowers (which notice may be by telephone) whether or not the requested Interest Period is available. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be, unless otherwise agreed by Lender, in a principal amount of the Dollar Equivalent of $250,000 or a whole multiple of the Dollar Equivalent of $100,000 in excess thereof (or, in connection with any conversion or continuation of a Term Loan, if less, the entire principal thereof then outstanding). Except as provided in Section 2.03(c), each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be, unless otherwise agreed by Lender, in a principal amount of the Dollar Equivalent of $250,000 or a whole multiple of the Dollar Equivalent of $100,000 in excess thereof (or, in connection with any conversion or continuation of a Term Loan, if less, the entire principal thereof then outstanding). Each Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (A) the applicable Facility and whether the applicable Borrower is requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Loans, as the case may be, under such Facility, (B) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (C) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (D) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Loans are to be converted, (E) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto, and (F) the currency of the Loans to be borrowed. If the Company fails to specify a currency in a Loan Notice requesting a Borrowing, then the Loans so requested shall be made in Dollars. If a Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Loan Notice or if a Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be made as, or converted  to, Base Rate Loans;  provided ,  however, that in the case of a failure to timely request a continuation of Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, such Loans shall be continued as Eurocurrency Rate Loans in their original currency with an Interest Period of one (1) month. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loans. If a Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one (1) month. Except as permitted pursuant to Section 2.02(c), no Loan may be converted into or continued as a Loan denominated in a different currency, but instead must be repaid in the original currency of such Loan and reborrowed in the other currency. 
 (b)     Advances. Following receipt of a Loan Notice for a Facility, upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension, Section 4.01), the Lender shall make the requested funds available to the applicable Borrower either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrowers on the books of Bank of America with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Lender by the Borro wers. 
 (c)     Eurocurrency Rate Loans. Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurocurrency Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurocurrency Rate Loan. During the existence of a Default, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurocurrency Rate Loans without the consent of the Lender, and the Lender may demand that any or all of the outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars be converted immediately to Base Rate Loans and any or all of the then outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency be prepaid, or redenominated into Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof, on the last day of the then current Interest Period w ith respect thereto. 
   
 37

After giving effect to all Revolving Borrowings, all conversions of Revolving Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Revolving Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than five (5) Interest Periods in effect in respect of the Revolving Facility. 
   
 2.03 Letters of Credit . 
 (a)     The Letter of Credit Commitment . 
(i)    Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Lender agrees (A) from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, to issue Letters of Credit for the account of the Company or any of its domestic Subsidiaries or, in the Lender's sole and absolute discretion any of its Foreign Subsidiaries, and to amend or extend Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in accordance with Section 2.03(b), and (B) to honor drawings under the Letters of Credit;  provided that after giving effect to any L/C Credit Extension with respect to any Letter of Credit, (x) the Total Revolving Outstandings shall not exceed the Revolving Facility and (y) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit. Each request by the U.S. Borrower for the issuance or amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be a representation by the U.S. Borrower that the L/C Credit Extension so requested complies with the conditions set forth in the proviso to the preceding sentence. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the U.S. Borrower's ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the U.S. Borrower may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. 
 (ii)    The Lender shall not be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if: 
(A)    subject to Section 2.03(b)(iii), the expiry date of the requested Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve (12) months after the date of issuance or last extension, unl ess the Lender has approved such expiry date; or 
(B)    the expiry date of the requested Letter of Credit would occur after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, unless the Lender has approved such expiry date. 
(C)    any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Lender from issuing the Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to the Lender or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Lender shall prohibit, or request that the Lender refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or the Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Lender with respect to the Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the Lender is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the Lender any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the Lender in good faith deems material to it; 
(D)    the issuance of the Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of the Lender applicable to letters of credit generally; 
   
 38 
 
 
(E)    except as otherwise agreed by the Lender, the Letter of Credit is in an initial stated amount less than $50,000; 
(F)    except as otherwise agreed by the Lender, the Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a currency other than Dollars or an Alternative Currency; 
(G)    the Letter of Credit contains any provisions for automatic reinstatement of the stated amount after any drawing thereunder; or 
(H)    the Lender does not as of the issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit issue Letters of Credit in the requested currency. 
(iii)    The Lender shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) the Lender would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to the Letter of Credit. 
 (b)     Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Extension Letters of Credit . 
(i)    Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the U.S. Borrower delivered to the Lender in the form of a Letter of Credit Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the U.S. Borrower and/or such Subsidiary, as required by the L/C Issuer. Such Letter of Credit Application may be sent by fax transmission, by United States mail, by overnight courier, by electronic transmission using the system provided by the Lender, by personal delivery or by any other means acceptable to the Lender. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the Lender not later than 11:00 a.m. at least five (5) Business Days (or such later date and time as the Lender may agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the Lender: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount and currency thereof and in the absence of specification of currency shall be deemed a request for a Letter of Credit denominated in Dollars; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (G) the purpose and nature of the requested Letter of Credit; and (H) such other matters as the Lender may require. In the case of a request for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the Lender (1) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (2) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (3) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (4) such other matters as the Lender may require. Additionally, the U.S. Borrower shall furnish to the Lender such other documents and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as the Lender may require. 
(ii)    Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the Lender will also deliver to the U.S. Borrower a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. 
   
 39 
 
 
(iii)    If the U.S. Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the Lender may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue a standby Letter of Credit that has  automatic extension provisions (each, an " Auto-Extension Letter of Credit ");  provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must permit the Lender to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve (12) month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the " Non-Extension  Notice Date") in each such twelve (12) month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the Lender, the U.S. Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the Lender for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lender shall permit the extension of such Letter  of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date;  provided,   however, that the Lender shall not permit any such extension if (A) the Lender has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or (iii) of Section 2.03(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven (7) Business Days before the  Non-Extension Notice Date from the U.S. Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and directing the Lender not to permit such exten sion. 
(iv)    If the U.S. Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the Lender may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that permits the automatic reinstatement of all or a portion of the stated amount thereof after any drawing thereunder (each, an " Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit"). Unless otherwise directed by the Lender, the U.S. Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to the Lender to permit such reinstatement. Once an Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit has been issued, except as provided in the following sentence, the Lender may reinstate all or a portion of the stated amount thereof in accordance with the provisions of such Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit permits the Lender to decline to reinstate all or any portion of the st ated amount thereof after a drawing thereunder by giving notice of such  non-reinstatement  within a specified number of days after such drawing (the " Non-Reinstatement  Deadline"), the Lender shall not permit such reinstatement if it has received a notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven (7) Business Days before  the  Non-Reinstatement Deadline from the U.S. Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied (treating such reinstatement as an L/C Credit Extensi on for purposes of this clause) and directing the Lender not to permit such reinstatement. 
 (c)     Drawings and Reimbursements. Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the Lender shall notify the U.S. Borrower thereof. In the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Company shall reimburse the Lender in such Alternative Currency, unless (i) the Lender (at its option) shall have specified in such notice that it will require reimbursement in Dollars, or (ii) in the absence of any such requirement for reimbursement in Dollars, the Company shall have notified the Lender promptly following receipt of the notice of drawing that the Company will reimburse the Lender in Dollars. In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Lender shall notify the Company of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof. Not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date of any payment by the Lender under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in Dollars, or the Applicable Time on the date of any payment by the Lender under a Letter of Credit to be reimbursed in an Alternative Currency (each such date, an " Honor Date "), the U.S. Borrower shall reimburse the Lender in an amount 
   
 40 
 
 
equal to the amount of such drawing and in the applicable currency. In the event that (A) a drawing denominated in an Alternative Currency is to be reimbursed in Dollars pursuant to the second sentence in this Section 2.03(c) and (B) the Dollar amount paid by the Company, whether on or after the Honor Date, shall not be adequate on the date of that payment to purchase in accordance with normal banking procedures a sum denominated in the Alternative Currency equal to the drawing, the Company agrees, as a separate and independent obligation, to indemnify the Lender for the loss resulting from its inability on that date to purchase the Alternative Currency in the full amount of the drawing. If the U.S. Borrower fails to so reimburse the Lender by such time, the U.S. Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (expressed in Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Altern ative Currency) (the " Unreimbursed Amount"), without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans. Any notice given by the Lender pursuant to this Section 2.03( c) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing;  provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. 
 (d)     Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the U.S. Borrower to reimburse the Lender for each drawing under each Letter of Credit shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following: 
(i)    any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document; 
(ii)    the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the U.S. Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement or by such Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated hereby or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; 
(iii)    any draft, demand, endorsement, certificate or other document presented under or in connection with such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order  to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; 
(iv)    waiver by the Lender of any requirement that exists for the Lender's protection and not the protection of the U.S. Borrower or any waiver by the Lender which does not in fa ct materially prejudice the U.S. Borrower; 
(v)    honor of a demand for payment presented electronically even if such Letter of Credit requires that demand be in the form of a draft; 
(vi)    any payment made by the Lender in respect of an otherwise complying item presented after the date specified as the expiration date of, or the date by which documents must be received under, such Letter of Credit if presentation after such date is authorized by the UCC, the ISP or the UCP, as applicable; 
   
 41 
 
 
(vii)    any payment by the Lender under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the Lender under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy,  debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any ar ising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; 
(viii)    any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense  available to, or a discharge of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or 
(ix)    any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant Alternative Currency to the Company or any Subsidiary or in the relevant currency m arkets generally. 
The U.S. Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the U.S. Borrower's instructions or other irregularity, the U.S. Borrower will immediately notify the Lender. The U.S. Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such cl aim against the Lender and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. 
 (e)     Role of the Lender. The Lender and the U.S. Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the Lender shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight or time draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. The U.S. Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to  its use of any Letter of Credit;  provided,   however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the U.S. Borrower's pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the Lender, any of its Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the Lender shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in Section 2.03(d). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Lender may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and the Lender shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring, endorsing or assigning or purporting to transfer, endorse or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. The Lender may send a Letter of Credit or conduct any communication to or from the beneficiary via the Society  for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (" SWIFT") message or overnight courier, or any other commercially reasonable means of communicating with a beneficiary. 
 (f)     Applicability of ISP and UCP; Limitation of Liability. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the Lender and the U.S. Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Lender shall not be responsible to the U.S. Borrower for, and the Lender's rights and remedies against the U.S. Borrower shall not be impaired by, any action or inaction of the Lender required or permitted under any law, order, or practice that is required or permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including the Law or any order of a jurisdiction where the Lender or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or UCP, as applicable, or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking 
   
 42 
 
 
Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade - International Financial Services Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law  & Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit chooses such law or practice. 
 (g)     Letter of Credit Fees .

 (b)     Default Rate . 
(i)    If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.

All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a  360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a  365-day year), or, in the case of interest in respect of Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies as to which market practice differs from the foregoing, in accordance with such market practice. Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.11, bear interest for one (1) day.

This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the Lender under any provision of this Agreement to payment of any Obligations hereunder at the Default Rate or under Article VIII. The Borrower's obligations under this paragraph shall survive the termination of the Commitments and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.

The Lender further agrees that if reasonably requested by the applicable Loan Party to the extent it is entitled to any other exemption from or a reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made hereunder or under any other Loan Document, it shall deliver to such Loan Party, at the time or times reasonably requested by such Loan Party, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or the taxing authorities of a jurisdiction pursuant to such applicable law or reasonably requested by such Loan Party as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, the Lender, if reasonably requested by a Loan Party, shall deliver such other documentation reasonably requested by a Loan Party as will enable such Loan Party to determine whether or not the Lender is subject to withholding or information reporting requirements and to enable the Loan Party to comply with such requirements. The Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promp tly notify the applicable Loan Party in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
   
 52 
 
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.01, the completion, execution and submission of any documentation (other than the IRS Form  W-9 (or successor form) described in the first sentence of this Section 3.01(d) or information required to comply with the obligations of an applicable Loan Party under Common Reporting Standards) shall not be required if in the Lender's reasonable judgment such completion execution or submission would subject the Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or exp ense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of the Lender. 
(e)    In addition to the foregoing, if the Lender claims any indemnity payment or additional payment amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.01, then at the request of the applicable Loan Party it shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different lending office for funding or booking the Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if in the judgment of the Lender the making of such a filing, change or assignment would avoid the need for or reduce the amount of any such indemnity payment or additional amount that may thereafter accrue, would not require the Lender to disclose any information the Lender deems confidential and would not, in the sole determination of the Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to the Lender. The applicable Loan Party shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
(f)    If the Lender determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 3.01 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments, including for additional amounts, made under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all  out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 3.01(f) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.01(f), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 3.01(f)  the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net  after-tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This Section 3.01(f) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 
   
 3.02 Illegality . 
(a)    If Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for Lender or its applicable Lending Office to perform any of its obligations hereunder or to make, maintain or fund or charge interest with respect to any Credit Extension or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by Lender to the Borrowers, (a) any obligation of Lender to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest with respect to any such Credit Extension or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in Dollars, to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on  which is determined by reference to the 
   
 53 
 
 
Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by Lender without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until Lender notifies the Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrowers shall, upon demand from Lender, prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all Eurocurrency Rate Loans of Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by Lender without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, the Lender shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to Lender without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component thereof until the Borrowers is advised in writing by Lender that it is no longer illegal for Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. 
(b)    If, in any applicable jurisdiction, Lender or any Designated Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for Lender or its applicable Designated Lender to (i) perform any of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, (ii) to fund or maintain its participation in any Loan or Letter of Credit or (iii) issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest or fees with respect to any Credit Extension Lender shall promptly notify Company, and until such notice by Lender is revoked, any obligation of Lender to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest or fees with respect to any such Credit Extension shall be suspended, and to the extent required by applicable Law, cancelled. Upon receipt of such notice, the Loan Parties shall, (A) repay outstanding Obligations) to the extent such illegality is applicable thereto, (B) to the extent applicable, Cash Collateralize that portion of applicable L/C Obligations comprised of the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit to the extent not otherwise Cash Collateralized and (C) take all reasonable actions requested by Lender to mitigate or avoid such illegality. 
(c)    Lender may at its option make any Credit Extension to any Borrower by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of Lender (a " Designated Lender ") to make such Credit Extension;  provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the relevant Borrower to repay such Credit Extension in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;  provided ,  however, if the Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for the Lender or its applicable Designated Lender to (i) perform any of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, (ii) to fund or maintain its participation in any Loan or (iii) issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest or fees with respect to any Credit Extension to any Designated Borrower who is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States, a State thereof or the District of Columbia then, on notice thereof by the Lender to the Company, and until such notice by the Lender is revoked, any obligation of the Lender or its Designated Lender to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest or fees with respect to any such Credit Extension shall be suspended, and to the extent required by applicable Law, cancelled. Upon receipt of such notice, the Loan Parties shall, take all reasonable actions requested by the Lender to mitigate or avoid such illegality. Any Designated Lender shall be con sidered a Lender. 
   
 3.03 Inability to Determine Rates . 
If in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof, the Lender determines that (a) deposits (whether in Dollars or an Alterna tive Currency) are not 
   
 54 
 
 
being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank eurodollar market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, (c) a fundamental change has occurred in the foreign exchange or interbank markets with respect to such Alternative Currency (including, without limitation, changes in national or international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange controls) or (d) the Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lender of funding such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the Lender will promptly so notify the Borrowers. Thereafter, (i) the obligation of the Lender to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (ii) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Eurocurrency Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Lender revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of such pending request, the Lender, in consultation with the Company, may establish an alternative interest rate for funding Loans in the applicable currency and amount, and with the same Interest Period as the Loan requested to be made, converted or continued, as the case may be in which case, such alternative rate of interest shall apply with r espect to such Loans.

The Borrowers shall pay to the Lender, (i) as long as the Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as "Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by the Lender (as determined by the Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), and (ii) as long as the Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any other central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by the Lender (as determined by the Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, provided the Borrowers shall have received at least ten (10) days' prior notice of such additional interest or costs from the Lender. If the Lender fails to give notice ten (10) days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable te n (10) days from receipt of such notice. 
 (f)     Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of the Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of the Lender's right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate the Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine (9) months prior to the date that the Lender notifies the Borrowers of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of the Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine (9) month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).

The undersigned Responsible Officer of the Company is familiar with the properties, businesses, assets and liabilities of the Loan Parties and is duly authorized to execute this ce rtificate on behalf of the Company and the other Loan Parties. 
The undersigned certifies that [he/she] has made such investigation and inquiries as to the financial condition of the Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries as the undersigned deems necessary and prudent for the purpose of providing this Certificate. The undersigned acknowledges that the Lender is relying on the truth and accuracy of this Certificate in connection with the making of Credit Extensions and the other transactions contemplated under the Credit Agreement. 
The undersigned certifies that the financial information, projections and assumptions which underlie and form the basis for the representations made in this Certificate were reason able when made and were made in good faith and continue to be reasonable as of the date hereof. 
BASED ON THE FOREGOING, the undersigned certifies that, both before and after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement: 
(a)    The fair value of the property (i) of the U.S. Loan Parties and (ii) of the Foreign Obligors, in each case, taken together as a group on a consolidated basis, is greater than the total amount of liabilities, including contingent liabilities, of such U.S. Loan Parties or Foreign Obligors, as applicable, taken together as a group on a consolidated basis . 
(b)    The present fair salable value of the assets (i) of the U.S. Loan Parties and (ii) of the Foreign Obligors, in each case, taken together as a group on a consolidated basis, is not less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of such U.S. Loan Parties or Foreign Obligors, as applicable, in each case taken together as a group  on a consolidated basis, on their debts as they become absolute and matured. 
 
 
(c)    The U.S. Loan Parties and the Foreign Obligors, in each case, taken together as a group on a consolidated basis, do not intend to, and do not believe that they will, incur debts or liabilities beyond such Persons' consolidated ability to pay such debts and liabilities as they mature. 
(d)    No Loan Party is engaged in business or a transaction, and is not about to engage in business or a transaction, for which such Loan Party's property would constitute an unre asonably small capital. 
(e)    The U.S. Loan Parties and the Foreign Obligors, in each case, taken together as a group on a consolidated basis, are able to pay their debts and liabilities, contingent obli gations and other commitments as they mature in the ordinary course of business. 
(f)    The amount of contingent liabilities at any time have been computed as the amount that, in the light of all the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents the  amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability.
