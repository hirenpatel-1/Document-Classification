This Agreement is entered into as of the 24th day of May 2005 between Frank Nitkiewicz (the "Executive") and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (the '"Bank"). 
 
WHEREAS the Bank and the Executive are parties to a Split-Dollar Agreement dated September 26, 1997 (the '"Split-Dollar Agreement"), which is attached hereto as Exhibit A; 
 
WHEREAS the Executive is the owner of the life insurance policy or policies set forth in Exhibit B (the "Policy") subject to the terms of the Split-Dollar Agreement and a collatera l assignment filed with the insurance company that issued the Policy; 
 
WHEREAS Section 2 of the Split-Dollar Agreement provides that the total cash surrender value of the Policy is subject to the claims of the Bank's creditors in the event of the Bank 's insolvency at all times while the Executive is employed by the Bank; 
 
WHEREAS the Bank has determined that the Policy has failed to perform in a manner consistent with the purposes of the Split-Dollar Agreement after a thorough review of its investme nt performance and costs; 
 
WHEREAS the Bank's Board of Directors has authorized (i) the establishment of a term life insurance program for the Executive and (ii) a rabbi trust as an informal means of funding the Bank's Pension Benefit Equalization Plan, in lieu of the Split-Dollar Agreement, subject to the Executive's consent; 
 
WHEREAS an amendment to terminate the Split-Dollar Agreement requires the written consent of both the Bank and the Executive and 
 
WHEREAS the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement to terminate the SplitÂ­ Dollar Agreement are acceptable to the Executive.

 l. 
 
The Split-Dollar Agreement is hereby terminated effective as of the execution of this Agreement without any further action by the Parties. The Executive relinquishes all rights to the Policy immediately except as otherwise provided under this Agreement. Executive acknowledges that the Bank may take any action it deems prudent with respect to the Policy in its sole discretion, including but not limited to surrendering the Policy for its cash surrender value or exchanging the Policy for other forms of permanent life insurance. Executive shall transfer the Policy to the Bank as soon as practicable, but in no event later than June 1, 2005.

 2. 
 
The Bank shall provide the Executive with a fixed term life insurance benefit equal to $1,075,000 during the Executive's employment with the Bank. The term life insurance benefit initially shall be initially provided under the Policy following termination of the Split-Dollar Agreement. The Bank shall be entitled to secure the term life insurance benefit through alternative forms of insurance as it selects in its sole discretion. The Bank shall pay all premiums required to provide the term life insurance benefit. The Executive acknowledges that this term life insurance benefit is a taxable benefit and that the Executive was afforded an opportunity to waive this benefit. The Executive shall be entitled to assign this term life insurance benefit to an irrevocable life insurance trust or similar estate planning vehicle. 
 
 
 
 3. 
 
As soon as reasonably practicable, the Bank shall establish a rabbi trust. The purpose of the rabbi trust is to informally fund benefits under the Bank's Pension Benefit Equalization Plan and the Thrift Benefit Equalization Plan. Except in the event of the Bank's insolvency, the funds contributed to the rabbi trust shall be used to provide benefits under these plans. The rabbi trust shall be established in a form substantially similar to the IRS model rabbi trust, as set forth in IRS Revenue Procedure 92-65. The Policy, any replacement policy for the Policy or the cash proceeds from the surrender of the Policy, net of any related expenses and costs, shall be contributed to the rabbi trust.

 WHEREAS, the Employer and the Employee agree to make the Policy subject to this Agreement; and 
 
 
WHEREAS, the Employee has assigned the Policy to the Employer as collateral for amounts to be advanced by the Employer under this Agreement by an instrument of assignment filed wit h the Insurer (hereinafter referred to as the "Assignment"); 
 
 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and of the mutual covenants herein contained, the Parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 
 
 
 
 1. 
 
The Parties hereto agree that the Policy shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and of the Assignment filed with the Insurer relating to the Policy. The Employee shall be the sole and absolute owner of the Policy and may exercise all ownership rights granted to the owner thereof by the terms of the Policy, except as may be otherwise provided herein and in the Assignment. Prior to termination of Employee's employment with Employer the total cash surrender of the policy shall be subject to the Assignment. In the event Employer becomes insolvent prior to such termination of employment, the total cash surrender value of the policy shall be deemed to be an asset of Employer and shall be subje ct to claims of general creditors of Employer under Federal and State law. 
 
 
 
 2. 
 
The premium for the Policy will be paid by the Employer during the Employee's employment and for any period of time that it may have an obligation to provide continuing fringe benefits thereafter. The premium will be allocated between the Employee and the Employer. The Employee's share of the premium (term insurance allocation) shall be paid by the Employer as agent for the Employee and shall be charged to the Employee as cash compensation, and for all purposes, including the Assignment, shall be deemed cash compensation and not Employer paid premium. Any dividend declared on the Policy shall be applied to purchase paid up insurance on the life of the Employee while the Employee is employed by Employer. 
 
 
 
 3. 
 
The Assignment shall not be terminated, altered or amended by the Employee without the express written consent of the Employer. The Parties hereto agree to take reasonable action t o cause such Assignment to conform to the provisions of this Agreement.

b. The Employee shall have the right to change the beneficiary or beneficiaries with regard to the death benefit in excess of the collaterally assigned interest of the Employer as  described under Section 5. 
 
c. The Employer shall not borrow against the Policy without the express written consent of the Employee.

b. The Employer shall have the right to receive the total cash surrender of the Policy reduced by an amount, if any, equal to the sum of (a) the present value of the annual Pension Benefit payable on account of Executive under the Bank's Benefit Equalization Plan, calculated as though the Employee had terminated employment immediately preceding Employee's death plus (b) an amount equal to four (4) times the Executive's total cash compensation for the calendar year preceding Executive's death. The balance of the death benefit provided under the Policy shall be paid directly by the Insurer to the beneficiary or beneficiaries and in the manner designated by the Employee. The Parties hereto agree that the beneficia ry designation provision of the Policy shall conform to the provisions hereof.

Upon payment to the Employer, the Employer shall release its interest in the Policy, and the Employee will thereafter own the Policy free from this Agreement and the Assignment. The Employee agrees to execute any and all documents necessary to effect repayment to the Employer provided herein.
