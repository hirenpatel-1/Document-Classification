 2. Conversion of Outstanding Balance. 
   
(a)       The Holder shall have the right from time to time, and at any time during the period beginning on the date which is one hundred eighty (180) days following the original issuance date (December 31, 2014) of this Note and ending on the later of: (i) the Maturity Date and (ii) the date of payment of the Note, each in respect of the remaining outstanding principal amount of this Note plus all accrued and unpaid interest to convert all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid principal amount of this Note into fully paid and non- assessable shares of Common Stock, as such Common Stock exists on the Original Issuance Date, or any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company into which such Common Stock shall hereafter be changed or reclassified at the Conversion Price.

   3   
 
 
     
 
 
   
 (b)        Mechanism to Effect Conversions. The Holder may convert this Note in whole or in part at any time and from time to time after the Original Issuance Date by delivering to the Company, via e-mail or a nationally recognized overnight courier service, a fully completed Notice of Conversion. To effect conversion(s) hereunder, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Company unless the entire principal amount of this Note, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, has been so converted. Conversion(s) hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding principal amount of this Note in an amount equal to the applicable conversion(s). The Company shall maintain records showing the amount(s) converted and the date of such conversion(s). The Holder, and any assignee by acceptance of this Note, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of a portion of this Note , the unpaid and unconverted amount of this Note may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof. 
   
 (c)        Delivery of Common Stock Upon Conversion. Upon receipt by the Company from the Holder of a facsimile transmission or e-mail (or other reasonable means of communication) of a Notice of Conversion, the Company shall, at its sole expense, issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered to or upon the order of the Holder certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion within two (2) Business Days after such receipt (the "Deadline") in accordance with the terms hereof and the Exchange Agreement. 
   
 (d)        Obligation of Company to Deliver Common Stock. Upon receipt by the Company of a Notice of Conversion, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the outstanding principal amount and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest on this Note shall be reduced to reflect such conversion, and, unless the Company defaults on its obligations under this Section 2, all rights with respect to the portion of this Note being so converted shall forthwith terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock or other securities, cash or other assets, as herein provided, on such conversion. If the Holder shall have given a Notice of Conversion as provided herein, the Company's obligation to issue and deliver the certificates for Common Stock shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the absence of any action by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision thereof, the recovery of any judgment against any person or any action to enforce the same, any failure or delay in the enforcement of any other obligation of the Company to the holder of record, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder of any obligation to the Company, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Company to the Holder in connection with such conversion. 
   
 (e)        Delivery of Common Stock by Electronic Transfer. In lieu of delivering physical certificates representing the Common Stock issuable upon conversion, provided the Company is participating in the Depository Trust Company (" DTC ") Fast Automated Securities Transfer (" FAST") program, upon request of the Holder the Company shall use its best efforts to cause its transfer agent to electronically transmit the Common Stock issuable upon conversion to the Holder by crediting the account of Holder's Prime Broker with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission (" DWAC ") system. 
   
 
 
   4   
 
 
     
 
 
   
 (f)        Failure to Deliver Common Stock Prior to Deadline. Without in any way limiting the Holder's right to pursue other remedies, including actual damages and/or equitable relief, the parties agree that if delivery of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note is not delivered by the Deadline, the Company shall pay to the Holder $2,000 per day in cash, for each day beyond the Deadline that the Company fails to deliver such Common Stock. Such cash amount shall be paid to Holder by the fifth day of the month following the month in which it has accrued or, at the option of the Holder (by written notice to the Company by the first day of the month following the month in which it has accrued), shall be added to the principal amount of this Note and be due on demand, in which event interest shall accrue thereon in accordance with the terms of this Note and such additional principal amount shall be convertible into Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Note. The Company agrees that the right to convert is a valuable right to the Holder. The damages resulting from a failure, attempt to frustrate, interference with such conversion right are difficult if not impossible to qualify. Accordingly the parties acknowledge that the liquidated damages provision contained in this Section 2  are justified. 
   
 (g)        Concerning the Shares. The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note may not be sold or transferred unless (i) such shares are sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, or (ii) the Company or its transfer agent shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions) to the effect that the shares to be sold or transferred may be sold or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration or (iii) such shares are sold or transferred pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or a successor rule) (" Rule 144") or (iv) such shares are transferred to an "affiliate" (as defined in Rule 144) of the Holder who agrees to sell or otherwise transfer the shares only in accordance with this Section 2 and who is an accredited investor. Until such time as the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note have been registered under the Securities Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction as to the number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold, each certificate for shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note that has not been so included in an effective registration statement or that has not been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption that permits removal of the legend, shall bear a legend substantially in the following form, as appropriate: 
   
 "NEITHER THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THESE SECURITIES ARE EXERCISABLE HAVE BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR (B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL (WHICH COUNSEL SHALL BE SELECTED BY THE HOLDER), IN A GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE FORM, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT OR (II) UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR RULE 144A UNDER SAID ACT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE SECURITIES MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT OR OTHER LOAN OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENT SECURED BY THE SECURITIES." 
   
 
 
   5   
 
 
     
 
 
   
The legend set forth above shall be removed and the Company shall issue to the Holder a new certificate therefore free of any transfer legend if (i) the Company or its transfer agent shall have received an opinion of counsel, in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions, to the effect that a public sale or transfer of such Common Stock may be made without registration under the Securities Act, which opinion shall be accepted by the Company so that the sale or transfer is effected or (ii) in the case of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, such security is registered for sale by the Holder under an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction as to the number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold. 
   
 (h)  Reservation of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock for the sole purpose of issuance under this Section 2, free from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holder, not less than such aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock as shall be issuable from time to time under this Section 2 (taking into account the adjustments of Section 3). The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 
   
 
 
   6   
 
 
     
 
 
   
 (i)        Fractional Shares. Upon a conversion hereunder the Company shall not be required to issue stock certificates representing fractions of shares of Common Stock, but may if otherwise permitted, issue,  in lieu of the final fraction of a share, one (1) whole share of Common Stock. 
   
 (j)        Transfer Taxes. The Company shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any certificate(s) upon conversion in a name other than that of the Holder of this Note and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such certificates unless or until the person or persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid 
   
 (k)        Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the number of Conversion Shares that may be acquired by the Holder upon exercise of this Note (or otherwise in respect hereof) shall be limited to the extent necessary to ensure that, following such conversion (or other issuance), the total number of shares of Common Stock then beneficially owned by such Holder and its affiliates and any other persons whose beneficial ownership of Common Stock would be aggregated with the Holder's for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), does not exceed 4.99% of the total number of issued and outstanding Common Stock (including for such purpose the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion). For such purposes, beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Holder, upon not less than 61 days' prior notice to the Company, may increase or decrease the beneficial ownership limitations provision of this Section, provided that the beneficial ownership limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of this Note held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section shall continue to apply. Any such increase or decrease will not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended beneficial ownership limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall  apply to a successor holder of this Note.

In the event that the rate of interest required to be paid or other charges hereunder exceed the maximum permitted by such law (such as, without limitation, the usury laws), any payments in excess of such maximum shall be credited against amounts owed by the Company to the Holder and thus refunded to the Company, or if no further amounts are owed by the Company to the Holder, shall be refunded to the Company. The Company hereby irrevocable consents to the reformation of this Note, as may be necessary by a court of law, so as to enable enforcement of this Note pursuant to summary judgment or summary proceeding. For avoidance of doubt, in the event that, for any reason, a finding by a court having jurisdiction over this Note is made that limits enforceability as a result of excessive interest or other origination or investment banking fees pursuant to the laws of any jurisdiction, then, such defense shall not be deemed to bar a summary proceeding or summary judgment on the Note but rather, the Note shall be fully and absolutely enforceable as to all principal and, the court having jurisdiction shall, after an inquest, have power to reform the Note so as to reduce interest amount to such amount as is immediately enforceable pursuant to summary judgmen t or summary proceeding and grant such award, plus any legal or enforcement fees of Holder(s). 
   
 (h)        Waiver. Any waiver by the Company or the Holder of a breach of any provision of this Note shall not operate as or be construed to be a waiver of any other breach of such provision or of any breach of any other provision of this Note. The failure of the Company or the Holder to insist upon strict adherence to any term of this Note on one or more occasions shall not be considered a waiver or deprive that party of the right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Note. Any waiver by the Company or the  Holder must be in writing.

 (i)        Severability. If any provision of this Note is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the balance of this Note shall remain in effect, and if any provision is inapplicable to any Person or circumstance, it shall nevertheless remain applicable to all other Persons and circumstances. If it shall be found that any interest or other amount deemed interest due hereunder violates the applicable law governing usury, the applicable rate of interest due hereunder shall automatically be lowered to equal the maximum rate of interest permitted under applicable l aw. 
   
 (j)        Next Business Day. Whenever any payment or other obligation hereunder shall be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day. 
   
 (k)        Headings. The headings contained herein are for convenience only, do not constitute a part of this Note and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.
