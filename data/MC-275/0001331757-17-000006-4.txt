Each Award will be equal to a percentage  of the Participant's annual base salary, as described in the applicable Appendices.   Performance Periods. A "Performance Period" is the one-calendar year period over which an Annual Award can be earned and vested pursuant to subsection 3.3(a).

 Award Notification. Participants will be notified by the Bank of an Annual Award, Deferred Award, Make-Whole Award or Gap Year Award. 
 
 
 
 (b) 
 
 Award Levels. Participants will receive Awards for each Performance Period based on their position with the Bank as described in the Appendices. 
 
 
 
 (c) 
 
 Award Payment. The Award Payment is the amount of an earned and vested Annual Award, Deferred Award, Make-Whole Award, or Gap Year Award; (or in 
 
 
 
 2 
 
 
 
the case of 2017 and 2018, the amounts earned under the 2015 and 2016 long-term incentive plans respectively, based on the achievement of the performance factors applicable to those plans), as adjusted based upon the level at which the Performance Goals have been achieved, that is ultimately paid to a Participant under the Plan. The Board, in its discretion, may consider Extraordinary Occurrences when assessing performance results and determining Award Payments. "Extraordinary Occurrences" mean those events that, in the opinion and discretion of the Board, are outside the significant influence of the Participant or the Bank and are likely to have a significant unanticipated effect, whether positive or negative,  on the Bank's operating and/or financial results. 
 
 
 Section 3.2 
 
 Performance Goals. "Performance Goals" are the performance factors established by the Board for each Performance Period, Deferral Performance Period and Gap Year Performance Period, as set forth in the applicable Appendices to the Plan, which are taken into consideration in determining the value of an Annual Award, Deferred Award, Make-Whole Award or Gap Year Award. The Boar d may adjust the Performance Goals to ensure the purposes of the Plan are served. 
 
 
 
 (a) 
 
 Establishment of Performance Goals. Performance Goals for Performance Periods, Deferral Performance Periods or the Gap Year Performance Period commencing on and after January 1, 2017 will be communicated to Partici pants after they have been established by the Board. 
 
 
 
 (b) 
 
 Achievement Level. Three achievement levels will be defined for each Performance Goal in determining how much of an Award is earned. 
 
 
 
 (i) 
 
 Threshold. The "Threshold" achievement level is the minimum achievement level accepted for a Performance Goal. 
 
 
 
 (ii) 
 
 Target . The "Target" achievement level is aligned to satisfactory business results. 
 
 
 
 (iii) 
 
 Maximum. The "Maximum" achievement level is achievement that substantially exceeds the Target achievement level. 
 
 
 
 (c) 
 
 Interpolation. Achievement levels between Threshold and Target and between Target and Maximum will be interpolated in a consistent manner as determined by the Committee. 
 
 
 
 (d) 
 
 Considerations in Establishing Performance Goals. In determining appropriate Performance Goals and the relative weight accorded each Performance Goal, the Committee will: 
 
 
 
 (i) 
 
Balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage Participants to expose the Bank to imprudent risks; 
 
 
 
 3 
 
 
 
 
 
 (ii) 
 
Make such determination in a manner designed to ensure that Participants' overall compensation is balanced and not excessive in amount and that the Annual Awards, Deferred Awards and Gap Year Awards are consistent with the Bank's policies and procedures regarding such compensation arrangements; and 
 
 
 
 (iii) 
 
Monitor the success of the Performance Goals and weighting established in prior years, alone and in combination with other incentive compensation awarded to the same Participants, and make appropriate adjustments in future calendar years as needed so that payments appropriately incentivize Participants, appropriately reflect risk and align with regulatory gu idance.

 Section 3.4 Special Gap Year Awards and Make-Whole Awards . 
 
 
 (a) 
 
 Background.

The Gap Year Award will become earned and vested over a three-year period beginning on January 1, 2017 and ending on December 31, 2019 (the "Gap Year Performance Period") to the extent: 
 
 
 
 (i) 
 
The Performance Goals for the Gap Year Performance Period, as set forth in the applicable Appendix to the Plan, are satisfied; 
 
 
 
 (ii) 
 
The Participant received a performance rating in the final year for the Gap Year Performance Period of at least "Meets Expectations"; and 
 
 
 
 (iii) 
 
The Participant is actively employed on the last day of the Gap Year Performance Period, unless otherwise provided in subsection 3.5(b) or 3.5(c) or Section 3.6. 
 
 
 
 (c) 
 
 Calculation of Awards. The value of the Make-Whole Awards and Gap Year Awards will be calculated in accordance with the applicable Appendix to the Plan.

 (c) 
 
 Termination Due to a Reduction in Force . 
 
 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 3.3 and 3.4 and subsection 3.5(a), if a Participant incurs a termination of service during a Performance Period, Deferral Performance Period, Gap Year or Make-Whole Performance Period due to a termination by the Bank without Cause due to a Reduction in Force:

 Section 3.8 Reduction or Forfeiture of Awards . 
 
 
 (a) 
 
Any Awards not yet paid may be reduced or eliminated, if any actual losses or other measures or aspects of performance are realized which would have caused a reduction in the amoun t of the Awards.

To the extent there is any conflict between a provision of the Plan or an Award and a provision of Cod e Section 409A, the applicable provision of Code Section 409A will control.

 Section 7.5 
 
 No Enlargement of Employment Rights. Nothing contained in the Plan may be construed as a contract of employment between the Bank and any person, nor may the Plan be deemed to give any person the right to be retained in the employ of the Bank or limit the right of the Bank to employ or discharge any person with or without cause. 
 
 
 
 Section 7.6 
 
 Limitations on Liability. The individual members of the Board will, in accordance with the Bank's by-laws, be indemnified and held harmless by the Bank with respect to any alleged breach of responsibilities performed or to be performed hereunder.

 11 
 
 
 
parts of the Plan, and the Plan will be construed and endorsed as if the illegal or invalid provisions had never been contained in the Plan. 
 
 
 Section 7.11 
 
 Information to be Furnished by a Participant. A Participant, or his or her beneficiary, must furnish the Committee with any and all documents, evidence, data or other information the Committee considers necessary or desirable for the purpose of administering the Plan.

The Bank agrees that it will make appropriate provision for the preservation of a Participant's rights under the Plan in any agreement or plan which it may enter into to effect any merger, consolidation, reorganization or transfer of assets. Upon such a merger, consolidation, reorganization or transfer of assets and assumption of Plan obligations of the Bank, the term "Bank" will refer to such other organization and the Plan will continue in full force and effect.

 2017-2019 PERFORMANCE PERIOD GOALS  & AWARDS  & 2017 MAKE WHOLE 
 AWARDS 
 
 2017 Make Whole Awards - Applies to 2017 plan year only 
The Make-Whole Awards represent the difference in the 2017 earning opportunity (as adjusted for the increase in the threshold, target and maximum percentages that are being implemented for 2017) between the annual incentive portion of this plan and the annual incentive that could have been earned if the Bank had implemented a short-term VPP plan for 2017 in the form that was contemplated at the time the 2015 LTIP was adopted (which plan would have provided for up to a 100 percent payout vs. the 50 percent payout provided by this plan). As provided by the 2015 LTIP, the combination of all incentive awards for 2017 (i.e., both short-term and long-term incentives) cannot exceed 1.5 times a Participant's 2017 base salary. Performance for the Make-Whole A wards will be determined based upon achievement of the 2017 performance goals.

Note: The final long-term incentive award for the 2017-2019 performance period (payable in 2020) will be calculated using the Participant's average base salary for the period from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019 and the overall result of this calculation will be multiplied by 50 percent so that the Participant's total incentive award for 2019 (payable in 2020) will be derived 50 percent from his or her 2019 annual incentive opportunity (under a plan similar to this Omnibus Plan) and 50 percent from the 2017-2019 long-term incentive opportunity. 
Information in this section of Appendix II relating to individual performance goals has been excluded and will be disclosed in the Registrant's periodic filing following the completion of the 2017-2019 Performance Period.
