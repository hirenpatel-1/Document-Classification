The number of Common Shares to be received upon the exercise of this Warrant may be adjusted from time to time as hereinafter set forth. The Common Shares deliverable upon such exe rcise, and as adjusted from time to time, are hereinafter sometimes referred to as "Warrant Stock." 
   
The Holder agrees with the Company that this Warrant is issued, and all the rights hereunder shall be held subject to, all of the conditions, limitations and provisions set forth h erein. 
   
 1.  Exercise of Warrant. This Warrant may be exercised by its presentation and surrender to the Company at 40 Marcus Drive, Suite One, Melville, New York 11747 (or such office or agency of the Company as it may designate in writing to the Holder hereof) with the Warrant Exercise Form attached hereto duly executed and accompanied by payment (either in cash or by official bank check, payable to the order of the Company) of the Exercise Price for the number of shares specified in such Form. The Company agrees that the Holder hereof shall be deemed the record owner of such Common Shares as of the close of business on the date on which this Warrant shall have been presented and payment made for such Common Shares as aforesaid whether or not the Company or its transfer agent is open for business. Certificates for the Common Shares so purchased shall be delivered to the Holder hereof within a reasonable time after the rights represented by this Warrant shall have been so exercised. If this Warrant is exercised in part only, the Company shall, upon surrender of this Warrant for cancellation, execute and deliver a new Warrant evidencing the rights of the Holder hereof to purchase the balance of the shares purchasable hereunder. 
   
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
   
 2.  Registered Owner. The Company may consider and treat the person in whose name this Warrant shall be registered as the absolute owner thereof for all purposes whatsoever and the Company shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary. Subject to the provisions hereof, the registered owner of this Warrant shall have the right to transfer it by assignment and the transferee thereof, upon his registration as owner of this Warrant, shall become vested with all the powers and rights of the transferor. Registration of any new owner shall take place upon presentation of this Warrant to the Company at its offices together with the Warrant Assignment Form attached hereto duly executed. In case of transfers by operation of law, the transferee shall notify the Company of such transfer and of his address, and shall submit appropriate evidence regarding the transfer so that this Warrant may be registered in the name of the transferee. This Warrant is transferable only on the books of the Company by the Holder on the surrender hereof, duly endorsed. Communications sent to any registered owner shall be effective as against all holders or transferees of this Warrant not registered at the time of sending the communication. 
   
 3.  Reservation of Shares. During the period within which the rights represented by this Warrant may be exercised, the Company shall, at all times, reserve and keep available out of its authorized capital stock, solely for the purposes of issuance upon exercise of this Warrant, such number of its Common Shares as shall be issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant; and if at any time the number of authorized Common Shares shall not be sufficient to effect the exercise of this Warrant, the Company will take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued Common Shares to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose; the Company shall have analogous obligations with respect to any other  securities or property issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. 
   
 4.  Fractional Shares. The Company shall not be required to issue certificates representing fractions of Common Shares, nor shall it be required to issue scrip or pay cash in lieu of fractional interests, it being the intent of the Company and the Holder that all fractional interests shall be eliminated. 
   
 5.  Rights of the Holder. The Holder shall not, by virtue hereof, be entitled to any voting or other rights of a stockholder of the Company, either at law or in equity, and the rights of the Holder are li mited to those expressed in this Warrant.

Each such adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any Event listed above shall occur. 
   
(b) Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted as set forth in Section 6.1 (whether or not the Company then or thereafter elects to issue additional Warrants in substitution for an adjustment in the number of shares of Warrant Stock), the number of shares of Warrant Stock specified in each Warrant which the Holder may purchase shall be adjusted, to the nearest full share, by multiplying such number of shares of Warrant Stock immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the Exercise Price immediately  prior to such adjustment and the denominator shall be the Exercise Price immediately thereafter. 
   
 6.2  Adjustment for Reorganization, Consolidation or Merger. In case of any reorganization of the Company (or any other entity, the securities of which are at the time receivable on the exercise of this Warrant) after the date hereof or in case after such date the Company (or any such other entity) shall consolidate with or merge with or into another entity, then, and in each such case, the Holder of this Warrant upon the exercise thereof as provided in Section l at any time after the consummation of such reorganization, consolidation or merger, shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of the securities and property receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant prior to such consummation, the securities or property to which such Holder would have been entitled upon such consummation if such Holder had exercised this Warrant immediately prior thereto, all subject to further adjustment as provided in Section 6.l; in each such case, the terms of this Warrant shall be applicable to the securities or property receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant after such consummation. 
   
 7.  Investment Intent.
