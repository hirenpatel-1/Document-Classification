 (iv)       Until each Lender funds its Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this  Section 2.2(c) to reimburse L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account  of L/C Issuer. 
   
(v)       Each Lender's obligation to make Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this  Section 2.2(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against L/C Issuer, Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition,  whether or not similar to any of the foregoing;  provided ,  however, that each Lender's obligation to make Loans (but not its obligation to fund its pro rata share of L/C Advances) pursuant to this  Section 2.2(c)  is subject to the conditions set forth in  Section 5.2 (other than delivery by Borrower of a Borrowing Request). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of Borrower to reimburse L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made by L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein. 
   
(vi)       If any Lender fails to make available to Administrative Agent for the account of L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provi sions of this  Section 2.2(c)  by the time specified in  Section 2.2(c)(ii), then, without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in the relevant Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of L/C Issuer submitted  to any Lender (through Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this  clause (vi)  shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
   
 (d)        Repayment of Participations . 
   
(i)       At any time after L/C Issuer has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender's L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accord ance with  Section 2.2(c), if Administrative Agent receives for the account of L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by Administrative Agent), Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof in th e same funds as those received by Administrative Agent. 
   
 
 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT - Page  34   
 
   
 
   
(ii)       If any payment received by Administrative Agent for the account of L/C Issuer pursuant to  Section 2.2(c)(i)  is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in  Section 12.24 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by L/C Issuer in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account of L/C Issuer its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this  Agreement. 
   
 (e)        Obligations Absolute. The obligation of Borrower to reimburse L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following: 
   
(i)       any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document; 
   
(ii)       the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; 
   
(iii)       any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Let ter of Credit; 
   
(iv)       waiver by L/C Issuer of any requirement that exists for L/C Issuer's protection and not the protection of Borrower or any waiver by L/C Issuer which does not in fact mat erially prejudice Borrower; 
   
(v)       honor of a demand for payment presented electronically even if such Letter of Credit requires that demand be in the form of a draft; 
   
(vi)       any payment made by L/C Issuer in respect of an otherwise complying item presented after the date specified as the expiration date of, or the date by which documents must be received under such Letter of Credit if presentation after such date is authorized by the UCC or the ISP, as applicable; 
   
(vii)       any payment by L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceedi ng under any Debtor Relief Law; or 
   
 
 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT - Page  35   
 
   
 
   
(viii)       any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defe nse available to, or a discharge of, Borrower or any Subsidiary. 
   
Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with Borrower's instructions or other irregularity, Borrower will promptly notify L/C Issuer. Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against L/C Issuer and its correspo ndents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. 
   
 (f)        Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of L/C Issuer, Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of Required Lenders; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit;   provided ,  however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude Borrower's pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of L/C Issuer, Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of L/C Issuer shall be liable  or responsible for any of the matters described in  clauses (i)  through  (viii)  of  Section 2.2(e) ;  provided ,  however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, Borrower may have a claim against L/C Issuer, and L/C Issuer may be liable to Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by Borrower which Borrower proves were caused by L/C Issuer's willful misconduct or gross negligence or L/C Issuer's willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. L/C Issuer may send a Letter of Credit or conduct any communication to or from the beneficiary via the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication message or overnight courier, or any other commercially reasonable means of communicating with a beneficiary. 
   
 (g)        Applicability of ISP; Limitation of Liability. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by L/C Issuer and Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued, the rules of the ISP shall apply to such Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, L/C Issuer shall not be responsible to Borrower for, and L/C Issuer's rights and remedies against Borrower shall not be impaired by, any action or inaction of L/C Issuer required or permitted under any Law, order, or practice that is required or permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including the Law or any order of a jurisdiction where L/C Issuer or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade - International Financial Services Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit or other Issuer Document chooses such Law or practice.

 (h)        Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuer. At any time there is more than one Lender, Borrower shall pay directly to L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit, at the rate per annum separately agreed between Borrower and L/C Issuer, computed on the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and payable on a quarterly basis in advance. Such fronting fee shall be due and payable upon the issuance or renewal of such Letter of Credit for the period from the date of issuance or renewal through the end of the first calendar quarter ending after such date and on the first Business Day of each April, July, October and January thereafter. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with  Section 1.4. In addition, Borrower shall pay directly to L/C Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonre fundable. 
   
 (i)        Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall control. 
   
 (j)        Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit. Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of Borrower, and that Borrower's business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries. 
   
 Section 2.3	 Fees . 
   
 (a)        Letter of Credit Fees. Borrower shall pay to Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance, subject to  Section 12.22 , with its Applicable Percentage a Letter of Credit fee (the " Letter of Credit Fee") for each Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Margin for LIBOR Portions times the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit;  provided ,  however, each such Letter of Credit Fee shall be no less than $1,000. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Lette r of Credit shall be determined in accordance with  Section 1.4. Letter of Credit Fees for each Letter of Credit shall be (i) due and payable in advance on the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit and on the first Business Day of each April, July, October and January thereafter so long as such Letter of Credit remains outstanding and (ii) computed on a quarterly basis in advance. If there is any change in the Applicable Margin for LIBOR Portions during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Margin for LIBOR Portions separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Margin for LIBOR Portions was in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein while any Event of Default exists, all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default Interest Rate. 
   
 
 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT - Page  37   
 
   
 
   
 (b)        Commitment Fees. Borrower agrees to pay to Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance, subject to  Section 12.22, with its Applicable Percentage a commitment fee on the daily average unused amount of the Commitment of such Lender for the period from and including the date of this Agreement to and including the Maturity Date (including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in  Article 5 is not met), at a rate equal to the Applicable Margin. For the purpose of calculating the commitment fee hereunder, the Commitment of each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed utilized by the amount of all outstanding Revolving Credit Loans and L/C Obligations, owing to such Revolving Credit Lender whether directly or by participation. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the first day of each April, July, October, and January during the term of this Agreement and on the Maturity Date. 
   
 Section 2.4	 Payments Generally; Administrative Agent's Clawback . 
   
 (a)        Generally. All payments of principal, interest, and other amounts to be made by Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be made to Administrative Agent for the account of Administrative Agent or L/C Issuer or the pro rata accounts of the applicable Lenders, as applicable, at the Principal Office in Dollars and immediately available funds, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, and free and clear of all Taxes at the time and in the manner provided herein. Payments by check or draft shall not constitute payment in immediately available funds until the required amount is actually received by Administrative Agent in full. Payments in immediately available funds received by Administrative Agent in the place designated for payment on a Business Day prior to 11:00 a.m. at such place of payment shall be credited prior to the close of business on the Business Day received, while payments received by Administrative Agent on a day other than a Business Day or after 11:00 a.m. on a Business Day shall not be credited until the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment of principal or interest on the Notes shall become due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, then such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day. Any such extension of time for payment shall be included in computing interest which has accrued and shall be payable in connection with such payment. Administrative Agent is hereby authorized upon notice to Borrower to charge the account of Borrower maintained with Administrative Agent for each payment of principal, interest and fees as it becomes d ue hereunder. 
   
 (b)        Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender, that such Lender will not make available to Administrative Agent such Lender's share of a Borrowing, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with this Agreement and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and Borrower severally agree to pay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the applicable Borrowing. If Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to Borrower the amount of such interest paid by Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan. Any payment by Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim Borrower may have against a Lender tha t shall have failed to make such payment to Administrative Agent.

 (c)        Payments by Borrower; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to Administrative Agent for the account of L/C Issuer or the applicable Lenders hereunder that Borrower will not make such payment, Administrative Agent may assume that Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to L/C Issuer or the applicable Lenders the amount due. In such event, if Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then L/C Issuer or each applicable Lender, as applicable, severally agrees to repay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to L/C Issuer or such Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 
   
 Section 2.5	 Evidence of Debt . 
   
(a)       The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of busine ss;  provided that such Lender or Administrative Agent may, in addition, request that such Loans be evidenced by the Notes. The Credit Extensions made by L/C Issuer shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by L/C Issuer and by Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer, and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made to Borrower and, with respect to Letters of Credit issued for the account of a Subsidiary, such Subsidiary and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by L/C Issuer or any Lender and the accounts and records of Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest err or. 
   
 (b)       In addition to the accounts and records referred to in  Section 2.5(a) above, each Lender and Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 
   
 Section 2.6	 Cash Collateral . 
   
 (a)        Certain Credit Support Events. If (i) L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, (ii) as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains outstanding, (iii) Borrower shall be required to provide Cash Collateral pursuant to  Section 10.2 , or (iv) there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, Borrower shall immediately (in the case of  clause (iii) above) or within one Business Day (in all other cases) following any request by Administrative Agent or L/C Issuer, provide Cash Collateral in an amount not less than the applicab le Minimum Collateral Amount (determined, in the case of Cash Collateral provided pursuant to  clause (iv)  above, after giving effect to  Section 12.22(a)(iv)  and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). 
   
 
 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT - Page  39   
 
   
 
   
 (b)        Grant of Security Interest. Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) Administrative Agent, for the benefit of Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer and Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral and all other Property so provided as Collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to  Section 2.6(c). If at any time Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than Administrative Agent or L/C Issuer as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, Borrower will, promptly upon demand by Administrative Agent, pay or provide to Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency. All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in one or more blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at LegacyTexas Bank. Borrower shall pay on demand therefor from time to time all customary account opening, activity and other administrative fees and charges in connection with the maintenance and disbursement of Cash Collateral. 
   
 (c)        Application. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this  Section 2.6  or  Sections 2.2 ,  10.2  or  12.22 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be held and applied to the satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations, obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other applicati on of such Property as may otherwise be provided for herein. 
   
 (d)        Release. Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting Exposure or to secure other obligations shall be released promptly following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or other obligations giving rise thereto, including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as appropriate,  its assignee following compliance with  Section 12.8(b)(vii)) or (ii) the determination by Administrative Agent and L/C Issuer that there exists excess Cash Collateral;  provided ,  however, (x) any such release shall be without prejudice to, and any disbursement or other transfer of Cash Collateral shall be and remain subject to, any other Lien conferred under the L oan Documents and the other applicable provisions of the Loan Documents, and (y)  the Person providing Cash Collateral and L/C Issuer may agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other o bligations. 
   
 Section 2.7	 Interest; Payment Terms . 
   
 (a)        Loans - Payment of Principal and Interest; Revolving Nature. The unpaid principal amount of each Portion of the Loans shall, subject to the following sentence and  Section 2.7(f), bear interest at the applicable Interest Rate. If at any time such rate of interest would exceed the Maximum Rate but for the provisions thereof limiting interest to the Maximum Rate, then any subsequent reduction shall not reduce the rate of interest on the Loans below the Maximum Rate until the aggregate amount of interest accrued on the Loans equals the aggregate amount of interest which would have accrued on the Loans if the interest rate had not been limited by the Maximum Rate. All accrued but unpaid interest on the principal  balance of the Loans shall be payable on each Payment Date and on the Maturity Date,  provided  that interest accruing at the Default Interest Rate pursuant to  Section 2.7(f) shall be payable on demand. The then Outstanding Amount of the Loans and all accrued but unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date. The unpaid principal balance of the Loans at any time shall be the total amount advanced hereunder by Lenders less the amount of principal payments made thereon by or for Borrower, which balance may be endorsed on the Notes from time to time by Lenders or otherwise noted in Lenders' and/or Administrative Agent's records, which notations shall be, absent manifest error, conclus ive evidence of the amounts owing hereunder from time to time. 
   
 
 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT - Page  40   
 
   
 
   
 (b)        Application. Except as expressly provided herein or in the Intercreditor Agreement to the contrary, all payments on the Obligations under the Loan Documents shall be applied in the following order of priority: (i) the payment or reimbursement of any expenses, costs or obligations (other than the outstanding principal amount thereof and interest thereon) for which Borrower shall be obligated or Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer, or any Lender shall be entitled pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan Documents; (ii) the payment of accrued but unpaid interest thereon; and (iii) the payment of all or any portion of the principal balance thereof then outstanding hereunder as directed by Borrower. If an Event of Default exists under this Agreement, the Notes or under any of the other Loan Documents, any such payment shall be applied as provided in  Section 10.3  below. 
   
 (c)        Computation Period. Interest on the Loans and all other amounts payable by Borrower hereunder on a per annum basis shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day) unless such calculation would result in a usurious rate, in which case interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 365-day year or 366-day year, as the case may be. In computing the number of days during which interest accrues, the day on which funds are initially advanced shall be included regardless of the time of day such advance is made, and the day on which funds are repaid shall be included unless repayment is credited prior to the close of business on the Business Day received. Each determination by Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. 
   
 (d)        Unconditional Payment. Borrower is and shall be obligated to pay all principal, interest and any and all other amounts which become payable under any of the Loan Documents absolutely and unconditionally and without any abatement, postponement, diminution or deduction whatsoever and without any reduction for counterclaim or setoff whatsoever. If at any time any payment received by Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been a voidable preference or fraudulent conveyance under any Debtor Relief Law, then the obligation to make such payment shall survive any cancellation or satisfaction of the Obligations under the Loan Documents and shall not be discharged or satisfied with any prior payment thereof or cancellation of such Obligations, but shall remain a valid and binding obligation enforceable in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof, and such pay ment shall be immediately due and payable upon demand. 
   
 (e)        Partial or Incomplete Payments. Remittances in payment of any part of the Obligations under the Loan Documents other than in the required amount in immediately available funds at the place where such Obligations are payable shall not, regardless of any receipt or credit issued therefor, constitute payment until the required amount is actually received by Administrative Agent in full in accordance herewith and shall be made and accepted subject to the condition that any check or draft may be handled for collection in accordance with the practice of the collecting bank or banks. Acceptance by Administrative Agent of any payment in an amount less than the full amount then due shall be deemed an acceptance on account only, and the failure to pa y the entire amount then due shall be and continue to be an Event of Default. 
   
 
 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT - Page  41   
 
   
 
   
 (f)        Default Interest Rate. For so long as any Event of Default exists, regardless of whether or not there has been an acceleration of the Loans, and at all times after the maturity of the Loans (whether by acceleration or otherwise), and in addition to all other rights and remedies of Administrative Agent or Lenders hereunder, (i) interest shall accrue on the Outstanding Amount of the Loans at the Default Interest Rate, (ii) interest shall accrue on any past due amount (other than the Outstanding Amount of the Loans) at the Default Interest Rate and (iii) upon the request of the Required Lenders, interest shall accrue on the principal amount of all other outstanding Obligations at the Default Interest Rate, and such accrued interest shall be immediately due and payable. Borrower acknowledges that it would be extremely difficult or impracticable to determine Administrative Agent's or Lenders' actual damages resulting from any late payment or Event of Default, and such accrued interest are reasonable estimates of those damages and do not constitute a penalty. 
   
 Section 2.8	 Voluntary Termination or Reduction of Commitments; Prepayments . 
   
 (a)        Voluntary Termination or Reduction of Commitments. Borrower may, upon written notice to Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitments, or from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments;  provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. three Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $1,000,000 or any whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof, and (iii) Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure would exceed the Aggregate Commitments. Administrative Agent will promptly notify Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitments. Any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall be applied to the Commitment of each Lender according to its Applicable Percentage. All fees accrued until the effective date of any termination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination or reduction and all Commitment Fees shall thereafter be computed on the basis of the Commitments, as so reduced. 
   
 (b)        Voluntary Prepayments. Subject to the conditions set forth below, Borrower shall have the right, at any time and from time to time upon at least three Business Days' prior written notice to Administrative Agent, to prepay the principal of the Loans in full or in part. If there is a prepayment of all or any portion of the principal of the Loans on or before the Maturity Date for such Loans, whether voluntary or because of acceleration or otherwise, such prepayment shall also include any and all accrued but unpaid interest on the amount of principal being so prepaid through and including the date of prepayment, plus any other sums which have become due to Lenders under the other Loan Documents on or before the date of prepayment, but  which have not been fully paid. 
   
 (c)        Mandatory Prepayments . Except as provided in  Section 2.9(e) hereof, if at any time the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure exceeds the Borrowing Base then in effect, then Borrower shall immediately prepay the entire amount of such excess to Administrative Agent, for the ratable account of the Lenders, and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to such excess;  provided ,  however , that Borrower shall not be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this  Section 2.8(c) unless after the prepayment in full of the Loans the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure exceeds the Borrowing Base then in effect. Each prepayment required by this  Section 2.8(c) shall be applied, first, to any Base Rate Portions then outstanding, and, second, to any LIBOR Portions then outstanding, and if more than one LIBOR Portion is then outstanding, to such LIBOR Portions in such order as Borrower may direct or, if Borrower fails to so direct, as Administrative Agent shall elect.

 Section 2.9	 Borrowing Base . 
   
 (a)        Borrowing Base Standards. The Borrowing Base shall represent the approval in their sole discretion of the Required Lenders or all Lenders, as applicable, of Administrative Agent's determination of the loan amount that may be supported by the Required Lenders' or all Lenders', as applicable, evaluation of the Proved Oil and Gas Properties of Borrower and its Subsidiaries. The determination of the Borrowing Base will be made in accordance with then-current practices, economic and pricing parameters, methodology, assumptions, and customary procedures and standards established by each Lender from time to time for its petroleum industry customers including without limitation (i) an analysis of such reserve and production data with respect to all of the Proved Oil and Gas Properties of Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including the Mortgaged Properties, as is provided to the Lenders in accordance herewith, (ii) an analysis of the assets, liabilities, cash flow, business, properties, prospects, management and ownership of Borrower and its Subsidiaries, (iii) Borrower's and its Subsidiaries' Hedging Transactions and the status (or lack thereof) of any provider of Hedging Transactions as an "Approved Commodity Swap Counterparty," and (iv) such other credit factors consistently applied as each Lender customarily considers in evaluating similar oil and gas credit facilities. Borrower and the Lenders acknowledge that due to the uncertainties of the oil and gas extraction process, the Oil and Gas Properties of Borrower and its Subsidiaries are not subject to evaluation with a high degree of accuracy and are subject to potential rapid deterioration in value, the determination of the loan amount will be less than the total present value of the Proved Oil and Gas Properties of Borrower and its Subsidiaries, which Borrower acknowledges to be essential for the adequate protection of the Lenders. Without limiting the foregoing, the Lenders may exclude from the Borrowing Base any oil and gas reserves or portion of production therefrom or any income from any other property, at any time, because title information is not satisfactory, such oil and gas reserves are not Mortgaged Properties in violation of this Agreement or such oil and gas reserves are not in "pay" status. The Borrowing Base shall initially be $17,000,000 on the Closing Date. 
   
 (b)        Periodic Determinations of Borrowing Base . 
   
(i)       The Borrowing Base shall be redetermined as of March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing March 1, 2017. On or before February 1 of each year, Borrower shall furnish Administrative Agent a Reserve Report as of the preceding January 1 prepared by an Independent Engineer covering all of the Proved Oil and Gas Properties of Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including the Mortgaged Properties. On or before August 1 of each year, Borrower shall furnish Administrative Agent a Reserve Report as of the preceding July 1 prepared by Borrower's own engineer and certified by a Responsible Officer of Borrower covering all of the Proved Oil and Gas Properties of Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including the Mortgaged Properties. Upon receipt of each such Reserve Report, Administrative Agent shall make a determination of the Borrowing Base which shall become effective upon approval by the R equired Lenders or all Lenders in accordance with the procedures set forth in  Section 2.9(d) and subsequent written notification from Administrative Agent to Borrower, and which, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, shall be the Borrowing Base until the effe ctive date of the next redetermination as provided in this  Section 2.9 . 
   
 
 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT - Page  43   
 
   
 
   
(ii)       In the event that Borrower does not furnish to Administrative Agent a Reserve Report by the dates specified in  Section 2.9(b)(i), then Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders or all Lenders, as applicable, may nonetheless redetermine the Borrowing Base and redesignate the Borrowing Base from time to time thereafter in their sole discretion until Administrative Agent receives the relevant Reserve Report, whereupon Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders or all Lenders, as  applicable, shall redetermine the Borrowing Base as otherwise specified in this  Section 2.9 . 
   
 (c)        Special Determinations of Borrowing Base . 
   
(i)       Special determinations of the Borrowing Base may be requested (A) by Borrower not more than two times per calendar year, or (B) by Administrative Agent at any time during the term hereof. If any special determination is requested by Borrower, Borrower shall provide, if requested by Administrative Agent, an updated Reserve Report prepared by Borrower's own engineer brought forward from the most recent Reserve Report furnished by Borrower to Administrative Agent. If any special determination is requested by Administrative Agent, Borrower will provide Administrative Agent with engineering data for the oil and gas reserves updated from the most recent Reserve Report furnished to Administrative Agent, as soon as is reasonably possible following the request. The determination whether to increase or decrease the Borrowing Base shall be made in accordance with the standards set forth i n  Section 2.9(a)  and the procedures set forth in  Section 2.9(d) . In the event of any special determination of the Borrowing Base pursuant to this  Section 2.9(c), Administrative Agent in the exercise of its discretion may suspend the next regularly scheduled determination of the Borrowing Base. 
   
 (ii)       In addition to the special determinations described in  Section 2.9(c)(i), Administrative Agent may, by notifying Borrower thereof, elect to cause an interim redetermination of the Borrowing Base any time (i) Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries Disposes of, whether in one Disposition or a series of Dispositions, Oil and Gas Properties the Borrowing Base value of which exceeds 5% of the Borrowing Base then in effect, (ii) any Commodity Hedging Transaction which has been taken into account in connection with the then current Borrowing Base is terminated and the Hedge Termination Value thereof determined in accordance therewith exceeds 5% of such Borrowing Base or (iii) a Person loses its status as an Approved Commodity Swap Counterparty if the then current Borrowing Base includes credit for Hedging Transactions with such Person. Any redetermination of the Borrowing Base pursuant to this  Section 2.9(c)(ii)  shall be made in accordance with the standards set forth in  Section 2.9(a)  and the procedures set forth in  Section 2.9(d) and shall not be considered a special determination requested by Administrative Agent within the meaning of  Section 2.9(c)(i). Borrower shall, if requested by Administrative Agent, deliver an updated Reserve Report prepared by Borrower's own engineer brought forward from the most recent Reserve Report furnished by Borrower to Administrative Agent. If a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists solely because of the reduction of the Borrowing Base pursuant to this  Section 2.9(c)(ii), Borrower shall, on the date of such occurrence, make a single lump sum payment in an amount sufficient to reduce the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure to or below the Borrowing  Base. 
   
 
 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT - Page  44   
 
   
 
   
 (d)        General Procedures With Respect to Determination of Borrowing Base. Administrative Agent shall propose a redetermined Borrowing Base within 30 days following receipt by Administrative Agent and the Lenders of a Reserve Report and other applicable information. After having received notice of such proposal from Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders (or all Lenders in the event of a proposed increase of the Borrowing Base) shall have 15 days to agree or disagree with such proposal. If at the end of such 15-day period, the Required Lenders (or all Lenders, in the event of a proposed increase of the Borrowing Base) shall not have communicated their approval or disapproval, such silence shall be deemed an approval, and Administrative Agent's proposal shall be the new Borrowing Base. If the Required Lenders (or all Lenders, in the event of a proposed increase of the Borrowing Base) cannot agree on the amount of the Borrowing Base within 7 days after Administrative Agent has been notified of their disapproval, then Administrative Agent shall propose a new redetermined Borrowing Base within 15 days after the end of such 7-day period and the foregoing process shall be repeated. This process shall be repeated until the Required Lenders (or all Lenders, in the event of a proposed increase of the Borrowing Base) agree on a new Borrowing Base. Upon the final redetermination of the Borrowing Base, Administrative Agent, the Lenders approving same and Borrower shall execute a Borrowing Base Ad justment Letter. 
   
 (e)        Borrowing Base Deficiency . 
   
(i)       If a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists because of a periodic or special determination made pursuant to  Section 2.9(b)  or  Section 2.9(c)(i), then Administrative Agent shall send a Borrowing Base Deficiency Notice to Borrower, and Borrower shall within 30 days following receipt of such Borrowing Base Deficiency Notice elect whether to (A) prepay an amount which would, if prepaid immediately, reduce the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure to the amount of the Borrowing Base, (B) execute one or more Mortgages (or cause a Subsidiary to execute one or more Mortgages) covering such other Oil and Gas Properties not previously taken into account in the determination of the Borrowing Base as are acceptable to Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders having present values which, in the opinion of Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders, based upon Administrative Agent's and the Required Lenders' evaluation of the engineering data provided them, taken in the aggregate are sufficient to increase the Borrowing Base to an amount at least equal to the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure, or (C) do any combination of the foregoing as is acceptable to Administrative Agent. If Borrower fails to make an election within 30 days after Borrower's receipt of the Borrowing Base Deficiency Notice, then Borrower shall be deemed to have selected the prepayment option specified in  clause (A)  above. 
   
(ii)       Borrower shall deliver or shall cause to be delivered such prepayments or Mortgages of additional Oil and Gas Properties in accordance with its election (or deemed elect ion) pursuant to  Section 2.9(e)(i)  as follows: 
   
 (A)        Prepayment Elections . If Borrower elects (or is deemed to have elected) to prepay an amount in accordance with  Section 2.9(e)(i)(A) above, then Borrower may make such prepayment in one installment within 90 days after Borrower's receipt of the Borrowing Base Deficiency Notice or, provided no Default has occurred and is continuing, in 6 equal consecutive monthly installments beginning within 30 days after Borrower's receipt of the Borrowing Base Deficiency Notice and continuing on the sa me day of each month thereafter. 
   
 
 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT - Page  45   
 
   
 
   
 (B)        Elections to Mortgage Additional Oil and Gas Properties . If Borrower elects to mortgage additional Oil and Gas Properties in accordance with  Section 2.9(e)(i)(B) above, then (1) such properties shall be acceptable to Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders with values determined by Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders in acc ordance with this  Section 2.9 and (2) Borrower or such Subsidiary shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to Administrative Agent one or more Mortgages within 30 days after Borrower's receipt of the Borrowing Base Deficiency Notice (or such longer time as Administrative Agent may agree in its sole discretion);  provided ,  however (x) if none of the additional Oil and Gas Properties offered by Borrower are acceptable to Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders, Borrower shall be deemed to have elected  the prepayment option specified in  Section 2.9(e)(i)(A)  (and Borrower shall make such prepayment in accordance with  Section 2.9(e)(ii)(A)); and (y) if the aggregate present values of additional Oil and Gas Properties which are acceptable to Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders are insufficient to eliminate the Borrowing Base Deficiency, then Borrower shall be deemed to have selected the option specified in  Section 2.9(e)(i)(C)  (and Borrower shall make prepayment and deliver one or more Mortgages as provided in  Section 2.9(e)(ii)(C)). Together with such Mortgages, Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Administrative Agent title opinions and/or other title information and data acceptable to Administrative Agent such that Administrative Agent shall have received, together with the title information previously delivered to Administrative Agent, acceptable title information regarding the Oil and Gas Properties of Borrower and its Subsidiaries that in the aggregate represent not less than 85% (or such lesser percentage as acceptable to Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) of the Recognized Value of Oil and Gas Properties evaluated in the most recent Reserve Report. 
   
 (C)        Combination Elections. If Borrower elects (or is deemed to have elected) to eliminate the Borrowing Base Deficiency by a combination of prepayment and mortgaging of additional Oil and Gas Properties in  accordance with  Section 2.9(e)(i)(C), then (1) within 30 days after Borrower's receipt of the Borrowing Base Deficiency Notice (or such longer time as Administrative Agent may agree in its sole discretion), Borrower shall (or shall cause a Subsidiary to) execute, acknowledge and deliver to Administrative Agent one or more Mortgages covering such additional Oil and Gas Properties and (2) Borrower shall pay Administrative Agent the amount by which the Borrowing Base deficiency exceeds the present values of such additional Oil and Gas Properties in one installment within 30 days after Borrower's receipt of the Borrowing Base Deficiency Notice or, provided no Default has occurred and is continuing, in six (6) equal consecutive monthly installments beginning within thirty (30) days after Borrower's receipt of the Borrowing Base Deficiency Notice and continuing on the same day of each month thereafter until paid. 
   
 (iii)        Applicable Margin Increase. During any time in which a Borrowing Base Deficiency exists, each of the Applicable Margins will be automatically increased by a rate equal to 2.00% per annum. 
   
 (f)        Borrowing Base Increase Fee. A fee shall be paid to Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders for each incremental increase in the new Borrowing Base over the previously existing Borrowing Base; provided that, such fee shall not be subject to "double-counting" should a future Borrowing Base be reduced, then subsequently increased to an amount at or below the highest previously determined or redetermined Borrowing Base. The amount of each such fee shall be a percentage of such increase as determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with then current market conditions. There shall be no obligation imposed upon Borrower to accept an increase of the Borrowing Base proposed by the Lenders. However, if Borrower accepts the increase in the Borrowing Base, the fee determined by Administrative Agent shall be due and payable immediately and without regard as to whether Borrower ever borrows the increased amou nt available under such new Borrowing Base. 
   
 
 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT - Page  46   
 
   
 
   
 (g)        Mortgage of Additional Properties. Borrower may from time to time upon written notice to Administrative Agent propose to add Oil and Gas Properties of Borrower or any Subsidiary as Mortgaged Properties to be included in the Borrowing Base. Any such proposal shall be accompanied by a Reserve Report, which may be prepared by Borrower's own engineer, applicable to such properties that conforms with the requirements of this Agreement and evidence sufficient to establish that Borrower or such Subsidiary, as applicable, has title to such Oil and Gas Properties. Any such addition shall become effective at such time as (i) Administrative Agent, with the approval of all of the Lenders, has made a determination of the amount by which the Borrowing Base  would be increased as the result of such addition, (ii) the conditions set out in this  Section 2.9, to the extent they are applicable to such additional Oil and Gas Properties, have been satisfied, (iii) Mortgages duly executed and acknowledged by Borrower or such Subsidiary, as applicable, have been delivered to Administrative Agent, and (iv) arrangements satisfactory to Administrative Agent have been made with respect to payment of recording fees and taxes, as applicable. In determining the increase in the Borrowing Base pursuant to this Section, Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall apply the parameters and other credit fa ctors set forth in this  Section 2.9 . A proposal by Borrower pursuant to this  Section 2.9(g)  shall constitute a request for a special determination of the Borrowing Base for purposes of  Section 2.9(c) .

 TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND INDEMNITY 
   
 Section 3.1	 Increased Costs . 
   
 (a)        Increased Costs Generally . If any Change in Law shall: 
   
(i)       impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in Adjusted LIBOR); 
   
(ii)       subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in  clauses (b)  through  (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its Loans, Loan principal, Letters of Credit, Commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves,  other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or 
   
(iii)       impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender; 
   
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or other Recipient, Borrower will pay to such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
   
 
 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT - Page  47   
 
   
 
   
 (b)        Capital or Liquidity Requirements. If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender's holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitment of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by such Lender or the Letters of Credit issued by L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as wil l compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
   
 (c)        Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in  Sections 3.1(a)  or  3.1(b) and delivered to Borrower, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after receipt t hereof. 
   
 (d)        Delay in Requests . Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this  Section 3.1  shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation;  provided  that Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this  Section 3.1 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than 9 months prior to the date that such Lender notifies Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 9-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
   
 Section 3.2	 Illegality. If any Lender determines that any Law or regulation has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to LIBOR, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon LIBOR, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to Borrower through Administrative Agent, (a) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue LIBOR Portions or to convert Base Rate Portions to LIBOR Portions shall be suspended, and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Portions the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the LIBOR component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Portions of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies Administrative Agent and Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all LIBOR Portions of such Lender to Base Rate Portions (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR component of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Portions to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Portions and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon LIBOR, Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the LIBOR component thereof until Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. 
   
 
 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT - Page  48   
 
   
 
   
 Section 3.3	 Inability to Determine Rates. If (a) Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a LIBOR Portion or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such LIBOR Portion, (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining LIBOR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Portion or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Portion, or (iii) LIBOR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Portion does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR Portion, or (b) by reason of any Change in Law any Lender would become subject to restrictions on the amount of a category of liabilities or assets which it may hold and notifies Administrative Agent of same, Administrative Agent will promptly so notify Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Portions shall be suspended, and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the LIBOR component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the LIBOR component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of LIBOR Portions or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Portions in the amount specified therein. 
   
 Section 3.4	 Taxes . 
   
 (a)        Defined Terms . For purposes of this Section, the term "applicable Law" includes FATCA. 
   
 (b)        Payment Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Law. If any applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this  Section 3.4) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
   
 (c)        Payment of Other Taxes by Borrower. Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, or at the option of Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment o f, any Other Taxes.

 (d)        Indemnification by Borrower. Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within 30 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or  attributable to amounts payable under this  Section 3.4) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount and derivation of such payment or liability delivered to Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent), or by Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of  a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
   
 (e)        Indemnification by Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that Borrower has not already indemnified Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable t o such Lender's failure to comply with the provisions of  Section 12.8 relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by Administrative Agent to such Lender from any other source against any amount due to Administrative Agent under this  Section 3.4(e) . 
   
 (f)        Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this  Section 3.4, Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent. 
   
 (g)        Status of Lenders . 
   
(i)       Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by Borrower or Administrative Agent as will enable Borrower or Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in  Section 3.4(g)(ii)(A) ,  (ii)(B)  and  (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in such Lender's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expens e or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.

Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party  the amount paid over pursuant to this  Section 3.4(h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Go vernmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  Section 3.4(h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this  Section 3.4(h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never bee n paid. This  Section 3.4(h) shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemn ifying party or any other Person.

 Section 3.5	 Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to Administrative Agent) from time to time, Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss,  cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: 
   
(a)       any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any LIBOR Portion on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandato ry, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); 
   
(b)       any failure by Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to lend a LIBOR Portion) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any LIBOR Portion on the date  or in the amount notified by Borrower; or 
   
(c)       any assignment of a LIBOR Portion on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by Borrower pursuant to  Section 3.6(b) ;

Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

 (iii)       in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under  Section 3.1  or payments required to be made pursuant to  Section 3.4 , such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; 
   
 (iv)       such assignment does not conflict with applicable Law; and 
   
(v)       in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver o r consent. 
   
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling Borrowe r to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

The Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not Administrative Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with, Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not Administ rative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to Lenders.

Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approv e any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;  provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in  Section 12.10 which requires the consent of all Lenders and affects such Participant. Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of  Sections 3.1 ,  3.4  and  3.5  (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under  Section 3.4(g)  (it being understood that the documentation required under  Section 3.4(g) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to  paragraph (b)  of this Section;  provided  that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of  Section 3.6  as if it were an assignee under  paragraph (b)  of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under  Sections 3.1  or  3.4, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at Borrower's request and expense, to us e reasonable efforts to cooperate with Borrower to effectuate the provisions of  Section 3.6 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of  Section 4.3  as though it were a Lender;  provided that such Participant agrees to pay to Administrative Agent any amount set-off for application to the Obligations under the Loan Documents as required pursuant to  Section 4.3 ;  provided further  that such Participant agrees to be subject to  Section 12.23 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrower, maintain a Participant Register;  provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administra tive Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
   
 (e)        Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledg e or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank;  provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

 Section 12.19	 Additional Interest Provision. It is expressly stipulated and agreed to be the intent of Borrower, Administrative Agent and each Lender at all times to comply strictly with the applicable Law governing the maximum rate or amount of interest payable on the indebtedness evidenced by any Note, any Loan Document, and the Related Indebtedness (or applicable United States federal Law to the extent that it permits any Lender to contract for, charge, take, reserve or receive a greater amount of interest than under applicable Law). If the applicable Law is ever judicially interpreted so as to render usurious any amount (a) contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received pursuant to any Note, any of the other Loan Documents or any other communication or writing by or between Borrower and any Lender related to the transaction or transactions that are the subject matter of the Loan Documents, (b) contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received by reason of Administrative Agent's or any Lender's exercise of the option to accelerate the maturity of any Note and/or the Related Indebtedness, or (c) Borrower will have paid or Administrative Agent or any Lender will have received by reason of any voluntary prepayment by Borrower of any Note and/or the Related Indebtedness, then it is Borrower's, Administrative Agent's and Lenders' express intent that all amounts charged in excess of the Maximum Rate shall be automatically canceled, ab initio, and all amounts in excess of the Maximum Rate theretofore collected by Administrative Agent or any Lender shall be credited on the principal balance of any Note and/or the Related Indebtedness (or, if any Note and all Related Indebtedness have been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded to Borrower), and the provisions of any Note and the other Loan Documents shall immediately be deemed reformed and the amounts thereafter collectible hereunder and thereunder reduced, without the necessity of the execution of any new document, so as to comply with the applicable Law, but so as to permit the recovery of the fullest amount otherwise called for hereunder and thereunder;  provided ,  however, if any Note or Related Indebtedness has been paid in full before the end of the stated term thereof, then Borrower, Administrative Agent and each Lender agree that Administrative Agent or any Lender, as applicable, shall, with reasonable promptness after Administrative Agent or such Lender discovers or is advised by Borrower that interest was received in an amount in excess of the Maximum Rate, either refund such excess interest to Borrower and/or credit such excess interest against such Note and/or any Related Indebtedness then owing by Borrower to Administrative Agent or such Lender. Borrower hereby agrees that as a condition precedent to any claim seeking usury penalties against Administrative Agent or any Lender, Borrower will provide written notice to Administrative Agent or such Lender, advising Administrative Agent or such Lender in reasonable detail of the nature and amount of the violation, and Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have 60 days after receipt of such notice in which to correct such usury violation, if any, by either refunding such excess interest to Borrower or crediting such excess interest against the Note to which the alleged violation relates and/or the Related Indebtedness then owing by Borrower to Administrative Agent or such Lender. All sums contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or received by Administrative Agent or any Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of any debt evidenced by any Note and/or the Related Indebtedness shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be amortized or spread, using the actuarial method, throughout the stated term of such Note and/or the Related Indebtedness (including any and all renewal and extension periods) until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of any Note and/or the Related Indebtedness does not exceed the Maximum Rate from time to time in effect and applicable to such Note and/or the Related Indebtedness for so long as debt is outstanding. In no event shall the provisions of Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code (which regulates certain revolving credit loan accounts and revolving triparty accounts) apply to the Notes and/or any of the Related Indebtedness. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, it is not the intention of Administrative Agent or any Lender to accelerate the maturity of any interest that has not accrued at the time of such acceleration or to collect unearned interest at the time of  such acceleration. 
   
 
 
 CREDIT AGREEMENT - Page  103   
 
   
 
   
 Section 12.20	 Ceiling Election. To the extent that any Lender is relying on Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code to determine the Maximum Rate payable on any Note and/or any other portion of the Obligations under the Loan Documents, such Lender will utilize the weekly ceiling from time to time in effect as provided in such Chapter 303. To the extent United States federal Law permits any Lender to contract for, charge, take, receive or reserve a greater amount of interest than under Texas Law, such Lender will rely on United States federal Law instead of such Chapter 303 for the purpose of determining the Maximum Rate. Additionally, to the extent permitted by applicable Law now or hereafter in effect, any Lender may, at its option and from time to time, utilize any other method of establishing the Maximum Rate under such Chapter 303 or under other applicable Law by giving notice, if required, to Borrower as provided  by applicable Law now or hereafter in effect. 
   
 Section 12.21	 USA Patriot Act Notice. Administrative Agent and each Lender hereby notify Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies Borrower and each other Obligated Party, which information includes the name and address of Borrower and each other Obligated Party and other information that will allow Administrative Agent and such Lender to identify Borrower and each other Obligated Party in accordance with the Patriot Act.

Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral  pursuant to this  Section 12.22(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.

 (iii)        Certain Fees . 
   
 (A)       No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any fee payable under  Section 2.3(b) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to  that Defaulting Lender).

 (C)       With respect to any fee payable under  Section 2.3(b)  or Letter of Credit Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to  clause (A)  or  (B) above, Borrower shall (x) pay to each Non-Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender's parti cipation in L/C Obligations that has been reallocated to such Non-Defaulting Lender pursuant to  clause (a)(iv) below, (y) pay to L/C Issuer the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such L/C Issuer's Fronting Exposure to such Defaulti ng Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.

No reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender's increased ex posure following such reallocation.

(b)       purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and ot her amounts owing them,  provided  that:

 Re: Adjustment of Borrowing Base 
   
 Ladies and Gentlemen: 
   
We refer to that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of October 3, 2016 (as amended from time to time, the " Credit Agreement ") among Carbon Natural Gas Company, a Texas corporation (" Borrower "), the financial institutions from time to time party thereto (the " Lenders "), and LegacyTexas Bank, as administrative agent for the Lenders (" Administrative Agent"). The defined terms used in this letter have the same meanings as are provided therefor in the Credit Agreement. 
   
 This letter will confirm our agreements with respect to the Borrowing Base: 
   
 (a) [Increase][Decrease][Reaffirmation] of Borrowing Base . Effective as of the date hereof  [and subject to the payment of the fee described below] , the Borrowing Base is hereby  [[increased][decreased] from [$__________] to [$__________]][reaffirmed at $__________]. The foregoing adjustment of the Borrowing Base is a periodic redetermination of the Borrowing Base under Section 2.9(b) of the Credit Agreement.       (b) [ Borrowing Base Increase Fee. The incremental increase in the Borrowing Base is $__________. As a condition to the increase in the Borrowing Base set forth above, Borrower will pay the Lenders a fee of $__________ for such incremental increase (_____% of $__________), to be shared among the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages.]       (c) Determination Date. The Borrowing Base as adjusted will remain in effect until __________, 201__, which is the date of the next periodic redetermination of the Borrowing Base, unless otherwise adjus ted pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.9 of the Credit Agreement. 
   
The agreements set forth herein are limited precisely as written and shall not be deemed (a) to be a waiver of or a consent to the modification of or deviation from any other term or condition of the Loan Documents, or (b) to prejudice any right or rights which Administrative Agent or the Lenders may now have or may have in the future under or in connection  with the Loan Documents. This letter constitutes a Loan Document under the Credit Agreement. 
   
The failure by Administrative Agent and the Lenders to exercise available rights and remedies is not intended (a) to operate as a waiver of rights and remedies except as expressly herein provided, and (b) to indicate any agreement on the part of Administrative Agent and the Lenders to waive their rights and remedies in the future. Administrative Agent and the Lenders are not obligated in any way with respect to future dealings between them and Borrower, except as set forth in the presently existing Loan Documents.
