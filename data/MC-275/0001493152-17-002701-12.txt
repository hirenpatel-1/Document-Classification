 Warrant 
   
 80,000 Shares September 26, 2016 
   
 FOR VALUE RECEIVED, BIORESTORATIVE THERAPIES, INC. , a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), hereby certifies that  JOHN DESMARAIS (the "Holder") is entitled, subject to the provisions of this Warrant, to purchase from the Company up to  EIGHTY THOUSAND (80,000) SHARES OF COMMON STOCK , $.001 par value per share, of the Company ("Common Shares") at a price of  FOUR DOLLARS ($4.00) per share (the "Exercise Price") during the period commencing on the date hereof and terminating at 5:00 P.M. on the fifth anniversary of the date hereof. 
   
The number of Common Shares to be received upon the exercise of this Warrant may be adjusted from time to time as hereinafter set forth. The Common Shares deliverable upon such exe rcise, and as adjusted from time to time, are hereinafter sometimes referred to as "Warrant Stock." 
   
The Holder agrees with the Company that this Warrant is issued, and all the rights hereunder shall be held subject to, all of the conditions, limitations and provisions set forth h erein. 
   
 1.  Exercise of Warrants . 
   
 1.1  Exercise. Exercise of this Warrant shall be made upon surrender of this Warrant with the Warrant Exercise Form attached hereto duly completed and signed and delivered to the Company, at its address 40 Marcus Drive, Suite One, Melville, New York 11747 (or such office or agency of the Company as it may designate in writing to the Holder hereof). Payment upon exercise shall be made at the written option of the Holder either (i) in cash, wire transfer or by certified or official bank check payable to the order of the Company equal to the applicable aggregate Exercise Price, (ii) by the withholding of shares of Warrant Stock otherwise issuable upon exercise of this Warrant, in accordance with Section 1.2 or (iii) by a combination of either of the foregoing methods, for the number of shares of Warrant Stock specified in such form (as such number shall be adjusted to reflect any adjustment in the total number of shares of Warrant Stock issuable to the Holder pursuant to the terms of this Warrant) and the Holder shall thereupon be entitled to receive the number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully-paid and non-assessable shares of Warrant Stock determined as provided herein. The Company shall promptly (but in no event later than five (5) business days after the date on which the Company receives this Warrant, the executed Warrant Exercise Form and payment of the Exercise Price, if any (the "Exercise Date")), issue or cause to be issued and cause to be delivered to or upon the written order of the Holder and in such name or names as the Holder may designate (subject to the restrictions on transfer described in the legend set forth on the face of this Warrant), a certificate for the shares of Warrant Stock issuable upon such exercise, with such restrictive legend as required by the Act, as applicable. Subject to the delivery of this Warrant, the executed Warrant Exercise Form and payment of the Exercise Price, if any, any person so designated by the Holder to receive Warrant Stock shall be deemed to have become the holder of record of such shares of Warrant Stock as of the Exercise Date. If this Warrant is exercised in part only, the Company shall, upon surrender of this Warrant for cancellation, execute and deliver a new Warrant evidencing the rights of the Holder hereof to purchase the balance of the shares pu rchasable hereunder. 
   
 
 
       
 
 
   
 
 
   
 1.2  Net Exercise. If the Fair Market Value (as hereinafter defined) of one Common Share is greater than the Exercise Price of one share of Warrant Stock (at the date of calculation as set forth below), in lieu of exercising this Warrant for cash, the Holder may elect to receive shares of Warrant Stock equal to the number of Common Shares computed using the following formula : 
   
   X=   Y*(A-B)/A           Where X=   the number of Common Shares to be issued to the Holder           Y=  the number of Common Shares purchasable under this Warrant or, if only a portion of this Warrant is being exercised, the portion of this Warrant being exercised (at the date of suc h calculation)           A=   the Fair Market Value of one Common Share           B=   the Exercise Price (as adjusted to the date of such calculation). 
   
 1.3  Fair Market Value . For purposes hereof, "Fair Market Value" shall be determined as follows: 
   
(a) if the Common Shares of the Company are listed on any established stock exchange or a national market system, including, without limitation, The Nasdaq Stock Market, or quoted on any other market for which closing sales prices are available, including, without limitation, the OTCQB, Fair Market Value shall be the average of the closing sales prices for the Common Shares, as quoted on such exchange, system or other market, on the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the Exercise Date; 
   
(b) if the Common Shares of the Company are quoted but closing sales prices are not reported, then Fair Market Value shall be the average of the mean between the high bid and low asked prices for the Common Shares on the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the Exercise Date; or 
   
 
 
   2   
 
 
   
 
 
   
(c) in the absence of any quotations for the Common Shares of the Company during the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the Exercise Date, Fair Market Value shall be deter mined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company. 
   
 2.  Registered Owner. The Company may consider and treat the person in whose name this Warrant shall be registered as the absolute owner thereof for all purposes whatsoever and the Company shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary. Subject to the provisions hereof, the registered owner of this Warrant shall have the right to transfer it by assignment and the transferee thereof, upon his registration as owner of this Warrant, shall become vested with all the powers and rights of the transferor. Registration of any new owner shall take place upon presentation of this Warrant to the Company at its offices together with the Warrant Assignment Form attached hereto duly executed. In case of transfers by operation of law, the transferee shall notify the Company of such transfer and of his address, and shall submit appropriate evidence regarding the transfer so that this Warrant may be registered in the name of the transferee. This Warrant is transferable only on the books of the Company by the Holder on the surrender hereof, duly endorsed. Communications sent to any registered owner shall be effective as against all holders or transferees of this Warrant not registered at the time of sending the communication. 
   
 3.  Reservation of Shares. During the period within which the rights represented by this Warrant may be exercised, the Company shall, at all times, reserve and keep available out of its authorized capital stock, solely for the purposes of issuance upon exercise of this Warrant, such number of its Common Shares as shall be issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant; and if at any time the number of authorized Common Shares shall not be sufficient to effect the exercise of this Warrant, the Company will take such corporate action as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued Common Shares to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose; the Company shall have analogous obligations with respect to any other  securities or property issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. 
   
 4.  Fractional Shares. The Company shall not be required to issue certificates representing fractions of Common Shares, nor shall it be required to issue scrip or pay cash in lieu of fractional interests, it being the intent of the Company and the Holder that all fractional interests shall be eliminated. 
   
 5.  Rights of the Holder. The Holder shall not, by virtue hereof, be entitled to any voting or other rights of a stockholder of the Company, either at law or in equity, and the rights of the Holder are li mited to those expressed in this Warrant. 
   
 6.  Anti-Dilution Provisions . 
   
 6.1  Adjustments for Stock Dividends; Combinations, Etc . (a) In case the Company shall do any of the following (an "Event"):

   3   
 
 
   
 
 
   
   
 (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Shares pursuant to a stock split or otherwise, 
   
(iii) combine the outstanding Common Shares into a smaller number of shares pursuant to a reverse split or otherwise, or 
   
 (iv) reclassify its Common Shares, 
   
then the Exercise Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or other distribution or of the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be changed to a price determined by dividing (a) the product of the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to such Event, multiplied by the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such Event by (b) the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after such Event. Each such adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any Event listed above shall occur. 
   
(b) Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted as set forth in Section 6.1 (whether or not the Company then or thereafter elects to issue additional Warrants in substitution for an adjustment in the number of shares of Warrant Stock), the number of shares of Warrant Stock specified in each Warrant which the Holder may purchase shall be adjusted, to the nearest full share, by multiplying such number of shares of Warrant Stock immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the Exercise Price immediately  prior to such adjustment and the denominator shall be the Exercise Price immediately thereafter. 
   
 6.2  Adjustment for Reorganization, Consolidation or Merger. In case of any reorganization of the Company (or any other entity, the securities of which are at the time receivable on the exercise of this Warrant) after the date hereof or in case after such date the Company (or any such other entity) shall consolidate with or merge with or into another entity, then, and in each such case, the Holder of this Warrant upon the exercise thereof as provided in Section l at any time after the consummation of such reorganization, consolidation or merger, shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of the securities and property receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant prior to such consummation, the securities or property to which such Holder would have been entitled upon such consummation if such Holder had exercised this Warrant immediately prior thereto, all subject to further adjustment as provided in Section 6.l; in each such case, the terms of this Warrant shall be applicable to the securities or property receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant after such consummation. 
   
 7.  Investment Intent. Unless, prior to the exercise of this Warrant, the issuance of the Warrant Stock has been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Act, the Warrant Exercise Form shall be accompanied by the Investment Representation Letter attached hereto, duly executed by the Holder. 
   
 8.  Restrictions on Transfer . 
   
 8.1  Transfer to Comply with the Securities Act of 1933. Neither this Warrant nor any Warrant Stock may be sold, assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of except as follows: (1) to a person who, in the opinion of counsel, is a person to whom this Warrant or the Warrant Stock may legally be transferred without registration and without the delivery of a current prospectus under the Act with respect thereto and then only against receipt of an agreement of such person to comply with the provisions of this Section 8 with respect to any resale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of such securities; or (2) to any person upon delivery of a prospectus then meeting the requirements of the Act relating to such securities and the offering thereof for such sale, ass ignment, transfer or disposition.

 9.  Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Warrant.

No oral or written representations have been made or oral information furnished to the undersigned or its advisers in connection with the investment in the Shares.         (g)The undersigned confirms that the representations and warranties set forth in the Subscription Agreement pursuant to which the Warrant was issued are true and correct as of the dat e hereof as if made on and as of the date hereof with respect to the purchase of the Shares.         (h)The undersigned acknowledges that counsel to the Company will be relying, and may rely, upon the foregoing in connection with any opinion of counsel it may give with regard to the issuance of the Shares by the Company to the undersigned, and any subsequent transfer of the Shares by the undersigned, and agrees to advise the Company and its counsel in writing  in the event of any change in any of the foregoing.
