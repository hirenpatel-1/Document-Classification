 Certain Additional Risk Factors 
   
In addition to the risk factors that are summarized in the Company's SEC Filings, you should consider the following: 
   
An investment in our Common Stock, and Warrants involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks summarized in the Company's SEC Filings, together with all of the other information provided to you in this Offering, before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our shares of Common Stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should read the section entitled "Forward-Looking Statements" included in our SEC Filings for a discussion of what types of statements are forward-looking statements, as well as the significance  of such statements. 
   
The terms of the Offering, the price for the shares of Common Stock and Warrants, including the exercise price, were not independently valued and may not be indicative of the futur e price of our Common Stock. 
   
Our board of directors determined the terms and conditions of the Offering, including the price per share for each Unit of Common Stock and the Warrant. The price per Unit and the exercise price were not necessarily determined to be equal to the market price of the Company's Common Stock on the OTCQB or the fair value of the Company. If you purchase Units in the Offering, you may not be able to sell any of the securities at or above the subscription price. The trading price of the Company's Common Stock will be determined by the marketplace, and will be influenced by many factors outside of the Company's control, including consumer acceptance of the Company's astaxanthin consumer health products, prevailing interest rates, investor perceptions, securities analyst research reports and general industry, geopolitical and economic conditions. Publicly traded stocks, including stocks of pharmaceutical and nutraceutical companies, often experience substantial market price volatility. These market fluctuations might not be related to the operating performance of particular companies whose shares are traded. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that if you purchase Units in the Offering you will later be able to sell those Units at or above the subscr iption price. 
   
The Securities are "Restricted Securities" under the Securities Act and there is no assurance that they will be registered. 
   
The Units sold in this Offering and the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants will be restricted securities under United States federal and applicable state securities laws. The Common Stock will be restricted securities unless and until the shares of Common Stock are registered. Restricted securities may not be transferred, sold or otherwise disposed of in the United States, except as permitted under United States federal and state securities laws, pursuant to registration or an exemption therefrom. You should be prepared to hold the Securities sold and the Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants for an indefinite period. 
   
 
 
       
 
 
       
 
 
   
None of the Shares of Common Stock issued in the Offering or upon the exercise of the Warrants may be sold unless, at the time of such intended sale, there is a current registration statement covering the resale of the securities or there exists an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, and such securities have been registered, qualified, or deemed to be exempt under applicable securities or "blue sky" laws in the state of residence of the seller or in the state where sales are being affected. 
   
If there is not an effective registration statement covering the resale of the Shares, Purchasers will be precluded from disposing of such Shares unless such Shares may become eligible to be disposed of under the exemptions provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act without restriction. If the Shares are not registered for resale under the Securities Act, or exempt therefrom, and registered or qualified under applicable securities or "blue sky" laws, or deemed exempt therefrom, the value of the Securities will be greatly reduced. 
   
Purchasers will be relying on management's judgment regarding the use of proceeds from this Offering and we may apply the proceeds to uses that may not increase the value of your i nvestment or improve our operating results. 
   
We expect to use the proceeds of this Offering to further develop our technology or utilize other technology, begin focused and targeted marketing efforts, and for general working capital purposes. Our management will have broad discretion with respect to the use of the net proceeds from this Offering and Purchasers will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of these proceeds. We cannot assure you that the net proceeds will be used for purposes that ultimately increase our results of operations, busine ss prospects or the value of your investment. 
   
An investment in the Company is speculative and there can be no assurance of any return on any such investment. 
   
An investment in the company is speculative and there is no assurance that Purchasers will obtain any return on their investment. Purchasers will be subject to substantial risks in volved in an investment in the Company, including the risk of losing their entire investment. 
   
 Insufficient Capital 
   
There can be no assurance or guarantee that the Company will raise sufficient capital, through this Offering, to meet the Company's business objectives. The audited financial statements include a going concern qualification and the Company has significant liquidity issues. There can be no assurance that other obligations that are necessary for the Company wi ll not be incurred or that the budgeted expenditures will not be subject to any material increase.

   2   
 
 
       
 
 
   
 (b)  Conditions to Exercise of the Warrant . 
   
 (i) Notwithstanding the provisions of any provision of this Warrant, including  Section 1.3, the exercise of this Warrant is contingent upon the Company's satisfaction that the issuance of the Shares for which this Warrant is being exercised is exempt from the requirements of the Securities Act and all applicable state securities laws or the Shares are duly registered under the Securities Act. The Holder of this Warrant agrees to execute any and a ll documents deemed necessary by the Company to effect the exercise of this Warrant.

To the extent that the  limitation contained in this  Section 1.3(b)(ii) applies, the determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by such Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which a portion of this Warrant is exercisable shall be in the sole discretion of a Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be each Holder's determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by such Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to such aggregate percentage limitation, and the Company shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination other than its obligation in this  Section 1.3(b)(ii) above to, upon the Holder's request, confirm in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. Notwithstanding any provision of this  Section 1.3(b)(ii)  to the contrary, the limitations on the exercise of this Warrant under this  Section 1.3(b)(ii) shall not be applicable from and after the date that is 61 days after the date that the Holder provides written notice to the Company that the Holder elects to have Beneficial Ownership of the Company's Common Stock in excess of the Maximum Percentage, in which case such Holder shall have the right to exercise this Warrant without the limitations of this  Section 1.3(b)(ii) ;  provided , that the limitations of this  Section 1.3(b)(ii) shall again be applicable to any assignee of this Warrant until 61 days after such assignee provides such notice to the Company.

In connection with any transfer of this Warrant or the Shares issuable upon exercise hereof, other than pursuant to an effective registration statement or Rule 144, to the Company or to an Affiliate of a Holder, the Company may require the transferor to provide to the Company an opinion of counsel selected by the transferor and reasonably acceptable to the Company, the form and substance of which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that such transfer does not require registration of the transferred Warrant or Shares under the Securities Act. As a condition of transfer, any such transferee shall agree in writing to be bound by the terms of this Warrant and the Agreement and shall have the rights and obligations of a Holde r under this Warrant and the Agreement. 
   
 2.2.  Legend . 
   
(a) The Holder agrees to the imprinting of a legend on any of the Shares issuable upon exercise hereof in the following form: 
   
THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR THE SECURITIES COMMISSION OF ANY STATE IN RELIANCE UPON AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS AS EVIDENCED BY A LEGAL OPINION OF COUNSEL TO THE TRANSFEROR TO SUCH EFFECT, THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH SHALL BE REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE CORPORATION. THIS SECURITY MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT WITH A REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER OR OTHER LOAN WITH A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT IS AN "ACCREDITED INVESTOR" AS DEFINED I N RULE 501(a) UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR OTHER LOAN SECURED BY SUCH SECURITIES.

 2.3.  Sale. The Holder agrees that the Holder will sell this Warrant or any Shares issuable upon exercise hereof only pursuant to either: (i) the registration requirements of the Securities Act, including any applicable prospectus delivery requirements; or (ii) an exemption therefrom, and that if this Warrant or any Shares issuable upon exercise hereof are sold pursuant to any such effective registration statement, they will be sold in compliance with the plan of distribution set forth therein, and acknowledges that the removal of the restrictive legend from certificates representing the Shares or this Warrant is predicated upon the Company's reliance upon this understanding. 
   
 3.   Fractional Shares 
   
Notwithstanding that the number of Shares purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant may have been adjusted pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company shall nonetheless not be required to issue fractions of Shares upon exercise of this Warrant or to distribute certificates that evidence fractional shares, provided that in lieu of any fraction shares, the Company shall make a cash payment to the Holder in an amount equal to the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in its reasonable good faith) of  such fractional share. 
   
 
 
   5   
 
 
       
 
 
   
 4.   ANTIDILUTION PROVISIONS 
   
 4.1.  Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Company shall at any time subdivide or combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock, this Warrant shall, after that subdivision or combination, evidence the right to purchase the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issuable as a result of that change with respect to the shares of Common Stock which were purchasable under this Warrant immediately before that subdivision or combination. If the Company shall at any time subdivide the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Warrant Exercise Price then in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased, and, if the Company shall at any time combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Warrant Exercise Price then in effect immediately before that combination shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustment under this section shall become effective at the close of business on t he date the subdivision or combination becomes effective. 
   
 4.2.  Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution. If the Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for above), the Holder of this Warrant shall, on its exercise, be entitled to purchase for the same aggregate consideration, in lieu of the Common Stock that the Holder would have been entitled to purchase but for such change, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock equivalent to the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been subject to purchase by the Holder on exercise of this Warrant immediatel y before that change. 
   
 4.3.  Reorganizations, Mergers, Consolidations or Sale of Assets. If at any time there shall be a capital reorganization of the Company's Common Stock (other than a combination, reclassification, exchange, or subdivision of shares provided for elsewhere above) or merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another entity, or the sale of the Company's properties and assets as, or substantially as, an entirety to any other person or entity, then, as a part of such reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale, lawful provision shall be made so that the Holder of this Warrant shall thereafter be entitled to receive upon exercise of this Warrant, during the period specified in this Warrant and upon payment of the Warrant Exercise Price then in effect, the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities or property of the Company, or of the successor entity resulting from such merger or consolidation, to which a holder of the Common Stock deliverable upon exercise of this Warrant would have been entitled in such capital reorganization, merger, or consolidation or sale if this Warrant had been exercised immediately before that capital reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale. In any such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Company's Board of Directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Warrant with respect to the rights and interests of the Holder of this Warrant after the reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale to the end that the provisions of this Warrant (including adjustment of the Warrant Exercise Price then in effect and number of Shares purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant) shall be applicable after that event, as near as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares or other property deliverable after that event upon exercise of this Warrant. The Company shall, within thirty (30) days after making such adjustment, give written notice (by first class mail, postage prepaid) to the Holder of this Warrant at the address of the Holder shown on the Company's books. That notice shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the adjustment and the method by which the adjustment was calculated, and specify the Warrant Exercise Price then in effect after the adjustment and the increased or decreased number of Shares or the other shares or property purchasable upon exercise of this Warrant. When appropriate, that notice may be given in advance and include as part of the notice required under other provisions of this Warrant.

 5.   Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Exercise 
   
The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock solely for the purpose of effecting the exercise of this Warrant such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the exercise of this Warrant and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the exercise of this Warrant, in addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the Holder of this Warrant, the Company will use its best efforts to take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but un-issued shares of Common Stock t o such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes. 
   
 6.   RIGHTS PRIOR TO EXERCISE OF WARRANT 
   
6.1. This Warrant does not entitle the Holder to any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company, including without limitation, the right to receive dividends or other distributions, to exercise any preemptive rights, to vote, or to consent or to receive notice as a stockholder of the Company. If, however, at any time prior to the termination of this Warra nt and prior to its exercise, any of the following events shall occur: 
   
(a) the Company shall declare any dividend payable in any securities upon its shares of Common Stock or make any distribution (other than a regular cash dividend) to the Holders of  its shares of Common Stock; or 
   
(b) the Company shall offer to the holders of its shares of Common Stock any additional Warrant of Common Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common  Stock or any right to subscribe for or purchase any thereof; or 
   
(c) a dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company (other than in connection with a consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of its property, assets and business as an entirety) shall be proposed and action by the Company with respect thereto has been approved by the Company's Board of Directors; 
   
then in any one or more of said events the Company shall give notice in writing of such event to the Holder at the last address of the Holder as it shall appear on the Company's records at least twenty (20) days prior to the date fixed as a record date or the date of closing the transfer books for the determination of the stockholders entitled to such dividends, distribution, or subscription rights, or for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote on such proposed dissolution, liquidation or winding up. Such notice shall specify such record date or the date of closing the transfer books, as the case may be. Failure to publish, mail or receive such notice or any defect therein or in the publication or mailing thereof shall not affect the validity of any action taken in connection with such dividend, distribution or subscription rights, or such proposed dissolution, liquidation or winding up. Each person in whose name any certificate for shares of Common Stock is to be issued shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of such shares on the date on which this instrument was surrendered and payment of the Warrant Exercise Price was made, irrespective of the date of delivery of such stock certificate, except that, if the date of such surrender and payment is a date when the stock transfer books of the Company are closed, such person shall be deemed to have become the holder of such shares of Common Stock at the close of business on the next succeeding date on which the stock transfer books are open.
