 Section 4. 	 Conversion . 
   
 (a)                   Voluntary Conversion. After the Original Issue Date until this Note is no longer outstanding, and provided that that the provisions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act so permit, this Note shall be c onvertible, in whole or in part, at any time, and from time to time, into shares of  Common Stock at the option of the Holder. The Holder shall effect conversions by delivering to the Company a Notice of Conversion, the form of which is attached hereto as  Annex A (each, a "Notice of Conversion"), specifying therein the principal amount of this Note to be converted and the date on which such conversion shall be effected (such date, the "Conversion Date"). If no Conversion Date is specified in a Notice of Conversion, the Conversion Date shall be the date that such Notice of Conversion is deemed delivered hereunder. No ink-original Notice of Conversion shall be required, nor shall any medallion guarantee (or other type of guarantee or notarization) of any Notice of Conversion form be required.  To effect conversions hereunder, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Company unless the entire principal amount of this Note, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, has been so converted. Conversions hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding principal amount of this Note in an amount equal to the applicable conversion. The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the principal amount(s) converted in each conversion, the date of each conversion, and the Conversion Price in effect at the time of each conversion. The Company may deliver an objection to any Notice of Conversion within one Business Day of delivery of such Notice of Conversion. In the event of any dispute or discrepancy, the records of the Holder shall be controlling and determinative in the absence of manifest error. The Holder, and any assignee by acceptance of this Note, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of a portion of this Note, the unpaid and unconverted principal amount of this Note may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof. 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 (b)                   Conversion Price. The "Conversion Price" in effect on any Conversion Date means, as of any Conversion Date or other date of determination, shall be 65% of the lowest trading price for the Company' s  Common Stock during the ten Trading Days immediately preceding the delivery by the Holder of a Notice of Conversion, provided however and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, during an Event of Default the Conversion Price in in effect on any Conversion Date means, as of any Conversion Date or other date of determination, shall be 55% of the lowest tra ding price for the Company's  Common Stock during the ten Trading Days immediately preceding the delivery by the Holder of a Notice of Conversion. The applicable prices shall be as reported by Bloomberg L.P. Notwiths tanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Conversion Price be less then the par value of the  Common  Stock. 
   
 (c) Mechanics of Conversion or Prepayment . 
   
 (i)                    Conversion Shares Issuable Upon Conversion of Principal Amount. The number of Conversion Shares issuable upon a conversion hereunder shall be determined by the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the outstanding principal amount of this Note to  be converted by (y) the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such conversion. 
   
 (ii)                  Delivery of Certificate Upon Conversion. Not later than three (3) Trading Days after each Conversion Date (the "Share Delivery Date"), the Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Holder any certificate o r certificates required to be delivered by the Company under this Section 4(c). 
   
 (iii)                Failure to Deliver Certificates. If, in the case of any Notice of Conversion, such certificate or certificates are not delivered to or as directed by the applicable Holder by the Share Delivery Date, the Holder shall be entitled to elect by written notice to the Company at any time on or before its receipt of such certificate or certificates, to rescind such Conversion, in which event the Company shall promptly return to the Holder any original Note delivered to the Company and the Holder shall promptly return to the Company the  Common  Stock certificates issued to such Holder pursuant to the rescinded Conversion Notice. 
   
 (iv)                 Partial Liquidated Damages. If the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder such certificate or certificates pursuant to Section 4(c)(ii) by the Share Delivery Date, the Company shall pay to the Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each $1,000 of principal amount being converted, $10 per Trading Day (increasing to $20 per Trading Day on the tenth Trading Day after such Conversion Date) for each Trading Day after such Share Delivery Date until such certificates are delivered or Holder rescinds such conversion. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder's right to pursue actual damages or declare an Event of Default pursuant to Section 7 hereof for the Company's failure to deliver Conversion Shares or, if applicable, cash, within the period specified herein and the Holder shall have the right to pursue all remedies available to it hereunder, at Law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief. The exercise of any such rights shall not prohibit the Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any  other Section hereof or under applicable Law. 
   
 (v)                   Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon Conversion. In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder such certificate or certificates by the Share Delivery Date pursuant to Section 4(c)(ii), and if after such Share Delivery Date the Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise), or the Ho lder's brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of  Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Conversion Shares which the Holder was entitled to receive upon the conversion relating to such Share Delivery Date (a "Buy-In"), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder (in addition to any other remedies available to or 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
elected by the Holder) the amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder's total purchase price (including any brokerage commissions) for the  Common  Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of  Common Stock that the Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the actual sale price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions) and (B) at the option of the Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) this Note in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of the attempted conversion (in which case such conversion shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares  of Common Stock that would have been issued if the Company had timely complied with its delivery requirements under Section 4(c)(ii). For example, if the Holder purchases  Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted conversion of this Note with respect to which the actual sale price of the Conversion Shares (including any brokerage commissions) giving rise to such purchase obligation was a total of $10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder's right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at Law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company's failure to timely deliver certificates representing shares of  Common  Stock upon conversion of this Note as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 
   
 (vi)                 Reservation of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company covenants that it will reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of  Common Stock for the purpose of issuances upon conversion of this Note and the issued with this Note, free from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holder (and the other holders of the Notes), not less than 300% of the Required Minimum; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall be insufficient to effect the conversion of this note or shall be less than the Required Minimum, the Company shall take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of  its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of  Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose. The Company covenants that all shares of  Common Stock that shall be issuable upon conversion of this Note shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. 
   
 (vii)               Fractional Shares. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of this Note. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such conversion, the Company shall at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction mult iplied by the Conversion Price or round up to the next whole share. 
   
 (viii)             Transfer Taxes and Expenses . The issuance of certificates for shares of the  Common Stock on conversion of this Note shall be made without charge to the Holder hereof for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such certificates, provided that, the Company shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such certificate upon conversion in a name other than that of the Holder of this Note so converted and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such certificates unless or until the Person or Persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid. The Company shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same- day processing of any Notice of Conversion and all fees to the Depository Trust Company (or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions) required for same-day electronic delivery of the Conversion Shares. 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 (d)                   Holder's Conversion Limitations. The Company shall not effect any conversion of this Note, and a Holder shall not have the right to convert any portion of this Note, to the extent that after giving effect to the conversion set forth on the applicable Notice of Conversion, the Holder (together with the Holder's Affiliates, and any Persons acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder's Affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares  of  Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note with respect to which such deter mination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of  Common Stock which are issuable upon (i) conversion of the remaining, unconverted principal amount of this Note beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other securities of the Company subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein (including, without limitation, any other Notes or the Warrants) beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 4(d), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. To the extent that the limitation contained in this Section 4(d) applies, the determination of whether this Note is convertible (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates) and of which principal amount of this Note is convertible shall be in the sole discretion of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Conversion shall be deemed to be the Holder's determination of whether this Note may be converted (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates) and which principal amount of this Note is convertible, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation. To ensure compliance with this restriction, the Holder will be deemed to represent to the Company each time it delivers a Notice of Conversion that such Notice of Conversion has not violated the restrictions set forth in this paragraph and the Company shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 4(d), in determining the number of outstan ding shares of  Common  Stock, the Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of  Common Stock as stated in the most recent of the following: (i) the Company's most recent periodic or annual report filed with the SEC, as the case may be, (ii) a more recent public announcement by the Company, or (iii) a more recent written notice by the Company or the Company's transfer agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within two Trading Days confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of  Common  Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of  Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Note, by the Holder or its Affiliates since the date as of  which such number of outstanding shares of  Common Stock was reported. The "Beneficial Ownership Limitation" shall be 4.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note held by the Holder. The Holder, upon not less than 61 days' prior notice to the Company, may increase the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 4(d) solely with respect to the Holder's Note, provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the num ber of shares of  Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of this Note held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section 4(d) shall continue to apply. Any such increase or decrease will not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company. The Holder may also decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 4(d) solely with respect to the Holder's Note at any time, which decrease shall be effectively immediately upon delivery of notice to the Company. The Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 4(d) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation contained here in or to make changes or supplements 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Note. 
 Section 5 .	 Certain Adjustments . 
   
 (a)                   Stock Dividends and Stock Splits. If the Company, at any time while this Note is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of  Common  Stock on shares of  Common  Stock or any  Common  Stock Equivalents (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of  Common  Stock issued by the Company upon conversion of,  or payment of interest on, the Notes or pursuant to any of the other Transaction Documents), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of  Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issues, in the event of a reclassification of shares of the Common Stock, any shares of capital stock of the Company, then the Conversion Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which  the numerator shall be the number of shares of  Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Company) outstanding immediately before such event, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification. 
   
 (b)                   Subsequent Equity Sales. If, at any time, for so long as the Note or any amounts accrued and payable thereunder remain outstanding, the Company or any Subsidiary, as applicable, sells or grants any optio n to purchase or sells or grants any right to reprice, or otherwise disposes of or issues, any  Common  Stock or  Common  Stock Equivalents entitling any Person to acquire shares of  Common Stock at an effective price per share that is lower than the Conversion Price then in effect (such lower price, the "Base Conversion Price" and each such issuance a "Dilutive Issu ance"), then the Conversion Price shall be immediately reduced to equal the Base Conversion Price. 
   
 If the holder of  Common  Stock or  Common Stock Equivalents outstanding on the Original Issue Date or issued thereafter shall at any time, whether by operation of purchase price adjustments, reset provisions, floating con version, exercise or exchange prices or otherwise, or due to warrants, options  or rights per share which are issued in connection with such issuance, receive or be entitled to receive shares of  Common Stock at an effective price per share that is lower than the Conversion Price then in effect, such issuance shall be deemed to have occurred for less than the Conversion Price on  such date and such issuance shall be deemed to be a Dilutive Issuance. 
   
 If after any Dilutive Issuance of  Common  Stock Equivalents, the price per share for which shares of  Common Stock may be issuable thereafter is amended or adjusted, and such price as so amended shall be less than the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such amendment or adjustment, then the Conversion Price shall be adjusted upon each such issuance or amendment as provided in this Section 5(b). 
   
 In case any  Common Stock Equivalent is issued in connection with the issue or sale of other securities of the Company, together comprising one integrated transaction, (x) the Common Stock Equivalent s will be deemed to have been issued for the Option Value of such  Common Stock Equivalents and (y) the other securities issued or sold in such integrated transaction shall be deemed to have been issued or sold for the difference of (I) the aggregate consideration received by the Company less any consideration paid or payable by the Company pursuant to the terms of such other securities of the Company, less (II) the Option Value. If any shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the amount of such consideration received by the Compa ny will be deemed to be the net amount received by the Company therefor. If any shares of 
   
 9 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 Common  Stock or  Common Stock Equivalents are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the amount of such consideration received by the Company will be the fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of publicly traded securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by the Company will be the VWAP of such public traded secur ities on the date of receipt. If any shares of  Common  Stock or  Common Stock Equivalents are issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the Company is the surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to such shares of Common Stock or Common Stoc k Equivalents, as the case may be. 
   
If the Company enters into a Variable Rate Transaction despite the prohibition set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Company shall be deemed to have issued  Common  Stock or  Common Stock Equivalents at the lowest possible conversion price at which such securities may be converted or exercised under the terms of such Variable Rate Transaction. 
   
The Company shall notify the Holder in writing, no later than the Trading Day following the issuance of any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents subject to this Section 5(b), indicating therein the applicable issuance price, or applicable reset price, exchange price, conversion price and other pricing terms (such notice, the "Dilutive Issuance Notice"). For purposes of clarification, whether or not the Company provides a Dilutive Issuance Notice pursuant to this Section 5(b), upon the occurrence of any Dilutive Issuance, the Holder is entitled to receive a number of Conversion Shares based upon the Base Conversion Price on or after the date of such Dilutive Issuance, regardless of whether the Holder accurat ely refers to the Base Conversion Price in the Notice of Conversion. 
   
The provisions of this Section 5(b) shall apply each time a Dilutive Issuance occurs after the Original Issue Date for so long as the Note or any amounts accrued and payable thereunder remain outstanding, but any adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 5(b) shall be downward only. 
   
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5(b), no adjustment will be made under this Section 5(b) in respect of an Exempt Issuance. 
 (c)                   Subsequent Rights Offerings. In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 5(a) above, if at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any  Common  Stock,  Common Stock Equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of shares of Common Stock (the "Purchase Rights"), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder h ad held the number of shares of  Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without regard to any limitations on conversion hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights ( provided ,  however, to the extent that the Holder's right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (or in the beneficial ownership of any shares of  Common  Stock as a result of such Distribution to such extent)). 
   
 (d)                   Pro Rata Distributions. During such time as this Note is outstanding, if the Company shall declare or make any dividend or other distribution of its assets or rights or warrants to acquire its assets, o r subscribe for or purchase any security other than Common Stock, to holders of shares of  Common Stock, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including, without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend, spin  off, reclassification, 
   
 10 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) (a "Distribution"), at any time after the issuance of this Note, then, in each such case, the Holder shall be entitled to participate in such Distribution to the same extent that the Holder would have participated therein if the Holder had held the number of shares of  Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without regard to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date of which a record is taken for such Distribution, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of  Common  Stock are to be determined for the participation in such Distribution ( provided ,  however, to the extent that the Holder's right to participate in any such Distribution would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation with respect to the Company or any other publicly-traded corporation subject to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Distribution to such extent (or  in the beneficial ownership of any shares of  Common Stock as a result of such Distribution to such extent)).) and the portion of such Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation with respect to the Company or any other publicly-traded corporation subject to Sect ion 13(d) of the Exchange Act).). 
   
 (e)       Fundamental Transaction. If, at any time while this Note is outstanding, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person, (ii) the Company, directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another Pers on) is completed pursuant to which holders of  Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of the outstanding  Common Stock, (iv) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization  or  recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the  Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, (v) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with another  Person whereby such other Person acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of  Common  Stock (not including any shares of  Common Stock held by the other Person or other Persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other Persons making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination) (each a "Fundamental Transaction"), then, upon any subsequent conversion of this Note, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Conversion Share that would have been issuable upon such conversion immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation on the conversion of this Note), the number of shares of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the "Alternate Consideration") receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of  Common Stock for which this Note is convertible immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation on the conversion of this Note). For purposes of any such conversion, the determination of the Conversion Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration is suable in respect of one 
 (1) share of  Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Conversion Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value  of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of  Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any conversion of this Note following such Fundamental Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event of a Fundamental Transactio n that is (1) an all cash transaction, (2) a "Rule 13e-3 transaction" as defined in 
   
 11 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act, or (3) a Fundamental Transaction involving a person or entity  not traded on a Trading Market, the Company or any Successor Entity (as defined below) shall, at the Holder's option, exercisable concurrently with the consummation of the Fundamental Transaction, purchase this Note from the Holder by paying to the Holder the product of (a) the number of Conversion Shares issuable upon full conversion of this Note (without regard to any limitation on conversion of this Note) and (b) the positive difference between the cash per share paid in such Fundamental Transaction minus the then in effect Conversion Price. The Company shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Company is not the survivor (the "Successor Entity") to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Company under this Note and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5(e) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and approved by the Holder (without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the holder of this Note, deliver to the Holder in exchange for this Note a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Note which is convertible for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the shares of Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon conversion of this Note (without regard to any limitations on the conversion of this Note) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with a conversion price which applies the Conversion Price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the relative value of the shares of  Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock, such number of shares of capital stock and such conversion price being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of this Note immediately prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holder. Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Note and the other Transaction Documents referring to the "Company" shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Note and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Company herein. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5(e), an Exempt Issuance shall not be deemed a Fundamental Transaction. 
   
 (f)                    Calculations. All calculations under this Section 5 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be.
