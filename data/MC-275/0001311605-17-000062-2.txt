 PURPOSE AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE DEFERRED SHARE UNIT PLAN 
 
 Section 2.01     Purpose of the Deferred Share Unit Plan: The purpose of the Plan is to assist the Corporation in the recruitment and retention of qualified persons to serve as directors of the Corporation and to align the interests of  Eligible Directors with the long-term interests of the shareholders of the Corporation. 
 
 Section 2.02     Administration of the Deferred Share Unit Plan: The Plan shall be administered by the Committee and the Committee shall have full authority to administer the Plan including the authority to interpret and construe any provision of the Plan and to adopt, amend and rescind such rules and regulations for administering the Plan as the Committee may deem necessary in order to comply with the requirements of the Plan. All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Committee in good faith shall be final and conclusive and shall be binding on the Eligible Directors and the Corporation. No member of the Committee shall be personally liable for any action taken or determination or interpretation made in good faith in connection with the Plan and all members of the Committee shall, in addition to their rights as directors of the Corporation, be fully protected, indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation with respect to any such action taken or determination or interpretation made in good faith. The appropriate officers of the Corporation are hereby authorized and empowered to do all things and execute and deliver all instruments, undertakings and applications and writings as they, in their absolute discretion, consider necessary for the implementation of the Plan and of the rules and regulations established for administering the Plan. All costs incurred in connection with the Plan shall be for the account of the Corporation. 
 
 Section 2.03     Delegation to Committee: All of the powers exercisable hereunder by the Board may, to the extent permitted by applicable law and as determined by resolution of the Board, be exercised by a committee of the Board comprised of not less than three (3) directors of the Corporation, including any compensation committee of the Board. 
 
 Section 2.04     Record Keeping : The Corporation shall maintain an account for each Eligible Director (an " Account ") in which shall be recorded: 
 
 (a)    the name and address of the Eligible Director; and 
 
 (b) 
 
the number of Deferred Share Units granted to and standing to the credit of the Eligible Director from time to time. 
 
 
 Section 2.05     Determination of Eligible Directors and Participation: The Committee shall from time to time determine the Eligible Directors who may participate in the Plan. The Committee shall from time to time determine the Eligible Directors to whom Deferred Share Units shall be granted and the provisions and restrictions with respect to such grant, all such determinations to be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plan, and the Committee may take into consideration the present and potential contributions of and the services rendered by the particular Eligible Director to the suc cess of the Corporation and any other factors which the Committee deems appropriate and relevant. 
 
 ARTICLE THREE 
 DEFERRED SHARE UNITS 
 
 Section 3.01     Deferred Share Unit Plan : The Plan is hereby established for Eligible Directors. 
 
 Section 3.02     Grant of Deferred Share Units: The Committee may from time to time grant Deferred Share Units to an Eligible Director in such numbers, at such times and on such terms and conditions, consistent with the Plan, as the Committee may in its sole discretion determine to be appropriate in respect of the services the Eligible Director renders as a member of the Board. For greater certainty, the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine any and all conditions to the vesting of any Deferred Share Units granted to an Eligible Director, which conditions shall be set out in the Deferred Share Unit Grant Letter. The Committee may in its sole and absolute discretion accelerate and/or waive any vesting or other conditions for all or any Deferred Share Units for any Eligible Director at any time and from time to time, subject to the requirements of paragraph 6801(d) of the regulations to the Tax Act for Canadian Eligible Directors, and provided that any such acceleration of vesting or waiver of any vesting or other conditions shall not accelerate the settlement/payment of such Deferred Share Units, which shall occur upon the Eligible Director's Separation from Service or Termination Date, as the case may be, in accordance with Section 3.04. Deferred Share Units that are fully vested at the time of grant as set forth in the applicable Deferred Share Unit Grant Letter, or that become vested through the satisfaction of any applicable vesting or other cond itions or the waiver of such vesting or other conditions by the Committee, are referred to as " Vested Deferred Share Units ". 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Section 3.03     Payment of Dividend Equivalents: If determined by the Committee in its sole discretion and if set out in the applicable Deferred Share Unit Grant Letter, on the payment date for cash dividends paid on Shares (th e " Dividend Payment Date"), the Account for each Eligible Director shall be credited with additional Deferred Share Units in respect of the number of Deferred Share Units credited to the Eligible Director 's Account as of the record date for payment of such dividends (the " Dividend Record Date"). In such case, the number of additional Deferred Share Units will be equal to (computed to two (2) decimal places) the aggregate amount of dividends that would have been paid to the Eligible Director if the Deferred Share Units in the Eligible Director's Account on the Dividend Record Date had been Shares divided by the Market Value of a Share on the Dividend Payment Date. However, no Deferred Share Units will be credited to an Eligible Director's Account in respect of dividends paid on Shares where the Dividend Record Date relating to such dividends falls after such Eligible Director's Termination Date. Any Deferred Share Units granted pursuant to this Section 3.03 shall have the same vesting and settlement /payment conditions as the underlying Deferred Share Units in the Eligible Director's Account. 
 
 Section 3.04     Redemption of Deferred Share Units 
 
 
 (a) 
 
Subject to the remainder of this Section 3.04, Vested Deferred Share Units will be redeemed following a U.S. Eligible Director's Separation from Service or following a Canadian Eligible Director's Termination Date, as applicable, on a date selected by the Committee in its sole discretion, and the Eligible Director shall have no ability to influence, directly  or indirectly, the calendar year in which payment is made (the " Redemption Date"). Vested Deferred Share Units credited to the Eligible Director's Account shall be redeemed and shall be paid by the Corporation to the Eligible Director (or if the Eligible Director has died, to the Eligible Director's Beneficiary) in the form of a lump sum cash payment, less Applicable Withholding Taxes. 
 
 
 
 (b) 
 
The Market Value of the Deferred Share Units for the purposes of determining the amount to be paid to the Eligible Director upon redemption of Deferred Share Units pursuant to this Section 3.04 shall be determined as of the Redemption Date. Each Deferred Share Unit so redeemed shall entitle the Eligible Director to receive the Market Value in cash in an amount that is rounded down to the nearest cent, less any Applicable Withholding Taxes as deducted, withheld and/or remitted in accordance with Section 4.01(c). The date on which such  cash payment is made to the Eligible Director is the " Payment Date ". 
 
 
 
 (c) 
 
The Payment Date with respect to Deferred Share Units of U.S. Eligible Directors will in all cases be on or before December 31 st  of the calendar year in which the Separation from Service occurs, or, if later by the date that is 2 Â½ months after the date of the Separation from Service and the Eligible Director shall have no ability to influence, directly or indirectly, the calendar year in which the Payment Date occurs. The Payment Date with respect to Deferred Share Units of Canadian  Eligible Directors will in all cases be on or before December 15 th  of the calendar year following the year in which the Termination Date occurs, and no Payment Date shall occur prior to the Canadian Eligible Director's Termination Date. In selecting the Redemption Date, the Committee will give due consideration to the time required to process the redemption of Deferred Share Units in order to ensure that the Payment Date wi ll occur within the time limitations of this Section 3.04(c). 
 
 
 
 (d) 
 
It is highly unlikely that a U.S. Eligible Director will be a "specified employee" as that term is defined under Section 409A of the Code (" Specified Employee"). However, if a U.S. Eligible Director is a Specified Employee at the time of his/her Separation from Service, the Payment Date with respect to the Deferred Share Units will not  be before the date that is six months and one day following his or her Separation from Service. 
 
 
 
 (e) 
 
Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan giving the Committee discretion to administer the Plan, interpret its terms, or amend or modify the Plan or Deferred Share Unit Awards, the Redemption Date and the Payment Date of Deferred Share Units will be in accordance with this Section 3.04 and will not be accelerated or delayed unless such acceleration or delay is permitted under Section 409A of the Code in respect of U.S. Eligible Directors or under paragraph 6801(d) of the Tax Act in respect of Canadian Eligible Directors. 
 
 
 
 (f) 
 
In the event that any Redemption Date is after the date on which the Shares ceased to be traded on the Exchange, provided such cessation in trading is not reasonably expected to be  temporary (the " Cease Trade Date"), the Market Value of the Deferred Share Units redeemed by or in respect of the Eligible Director pursuant to Section 3.04(b) shall be determined in accordance with the following : 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) 
 
where the Eligible Director's Termination Date or Separation from Service, as applicable, is before or not more than one (1) year after the last Trading Day before the Cease Trade Date, the value of each Deferred Share Unit credited to the Eligible Director's Account at his or her Redemption Date shall be equal to the Market Value on the last Trading Day bef ore the Cease Trade Date; and 
 
 
 
 (ii) 
 
where the Eligible Director's Termination Date or Separation from Service, as applicable, is after the date that is more than one (1) year after the last Trading Day before the Cease Trade Date, the value of each Deferred Share Unit credited to the Eligible Director's Account at his or her Redemption Date shall be based on the fair market value of a common share of the Corporation or of a Related Company at his or her Redemption Date as determined on a reasonable and equitable basis by the Committee after receiving the advice of one o r more independent firms of investment bankers of national repute. 
 
 
 
 (g) 
 
Upon payment of any amount pursuant to this Section 3.04 in satisfaction of Deferred Share Units credited to the Account of an Eligible Director, the particular Deferred Share Units in respect of which such payment was made shall be cancelled and no further payments shall be made from the Plan in relation to such Deferred Share Units. 
 
 
 
 (h) 
 
Subject to Sections 3.04(c), in the event that an Eligible Director's Redemption Date as determined pursuant to Section 3.04(a) would otherwise fall between a Dividend Record Date and the related Dividend Payment Date, then notwithstanding Section 3.04(a), the Redemption Date shall be the day immediately following such Dividend Payment Date for purposes of recording in the Account of the Eligible Director amounts referred to in Section 3.03, and making the calculation of the Market Value of the vested Deferred Share Units contemplated by Section 3.04(b). Subject to Sections 3.04(c), in the event that the Corporation is unable, by an Eligible Director's Redemption Date, to compute the Market Value of the vested Deferred Share Units recorded in such Eligible Director's Account by reason of the fact that any data required in order to compute the Market Value of a Share has not been made available to the Corporation, then the Redemption Date shall be the next following Trading Day on which such data is made available to the Corporation. 
 
 
 
 (i) 
 
Subject to Sections 3.04(c), in the event that an Eligible Director's Redemption Date as determined pursuant to Section 3.04(a) falls on or within ten (10) Business Days of the expiration of a Blackout Period applicable to such Eligible Director, then notwithstanding Section 3.04(a), the Redemption Date shall be extended to the earlier of: (i) the close of business on the tenth (10th) Business Day following the expiration of the Blackout Period, and (ii) the latest Payment Date specified in section 3.04(c). 
 
 
 
 (j) 
 
If the number of outstanding Shares is increased or decreased as a result of a subdivision, consolidation, reclassification or recapitalization and not as a result of the issuance of Shares for additional consideration or by way of a dividend in the ordinary course, the Committee shall  make appropriate adjustments to the number of Deferred Share Units outstanding under the Plan provided that the dollar value of Deferred Share Units credited to an Eligible Director's Account immediately after such an adjustment shall not exceed the dollar value of the Deferred Share Units credited to such Eligible Director's Account immediately prior thereto. Any determinations by the Committee as to the adjustments shall be made in its sole discretion and all such adjustments shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes under th e Plan. 
 
 
 
 (k) 
 
The following provisions are applicable to Eligible Directors who are both U.S. Eligible Directors and Canadian Eligible Directors (" Dual Participants"). For greater clarity, these forfeiture provisions are intended to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code and/or under paragraph 6801(d) of the regulations under the Tax Act, that may result because of the different requirements as to the time of settlement of Deferred Share Units with respect to a Dual Participant's Separation from Service and such Dual Participant's Termination Date. Unless it is determined that no adverse tax consequences under either the U.S. tax regime or the Canadian tax regime would result, if a Dual Participant otherwise would be entitled to payment of Deferred Share Units in any of the following circumstances, such Deferred Share Units shall instead be immediat ely and irrevocably forfeited (for greater certainty, without any compensation therefor): 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (i) 
 
a Dual Participant experiences a Separation from Service upon ceasing to be a director while continuing to provide services as an employee in circumstances that do not constitute a retirement from, or loss of office or employment with, the Corporation or an Affiliate, within the meaning of paragraph 6801(d) of the regulations under the Tax Act; or 
 
 
 
 (ii) 
 
a Dual Participant experiences a serious disability that continues for more than twenty-nine (29) months in circumstances that constitute a Separation from Service and do not constitute a retirement from, or loss of office or employment with, the Corporation or an Affiliate, within the meaning of paragraph 6801(d) of the regulations under the Tax Act; or 
 
 
 
 (iii) 
 
a Dual Participant experiences a retirement from, or loss of office or employment with, the Corporation or an Affiliate thereof, within the meaning of paragraph 6801(d) of the regulations under the Tax Act by virtue of ceasing employment as both an employee and as a director, but he or she continues to provide services as an independent contractor such that  he or she has not experienced a Separation from Service. 
 
 
 Section 3.05       Designation of Beneficiary: Subject to the requirements of applicable laws, an Eligible Director shall designate in writing a person who is a dependant or relation of the Eligible Director as a Beneficiary to receive any benefits that are payable under the Plan upon the death of such Eligible Director. The Eligible Director may, subject to applicable law, change such designation from time to time. Such designation or change shall be in such written form as may be determined by the Corporation from time to time. The initial designation of each Eligible Director shall be executed and filed with the Committee: (a) in the case of an existing director, within thirty (30) days following the effective date of this Plan, or (b) in the case of a  new director, within thirty (30) days after the Eligible Director's appointment to the Board. 
 
 Section 3.06       Death of Eligible Director: In the event of an Eligible Director's death prior to Separation from Service or Termination Date, as applicable, any and all Deferred Share Units then credited to the Eligible Director's Account shall become payable to the Eligible Director's Beneficiary in accordance with Section 3.05 and, for greater certainty, the date of death shall be deemed to be th e date of the Eligible Director's Separation from Service or Termination Date, as applicable. 
 
 Section 3.07     Market Fluctuation: For greater certainty, no amount will be paid to, or in respect of, an Eligible Director or any person with whom the Eligible Director does not deal at arm's length, within the meaning of the Tax Act, under the Plan or pursuant to any other arrangement, and no additional Deferred Share Units will be granted to an Eligible Director, to compensate the Eligible Director for any downward fluctuations in the price of a Share nor will any other form of benefit be conferred upon, or in respect of, an Eligible Director or any person with whom the Eligible Director does not deal at arm's length, within the meaning of the Tax Act, for such a purpose. 
 
 Section 3.08       Deferred Share Unit Grant Letter: Each grant of a Deferred Share Unit Award under the Plan shall be evidenced by a Deferred Share Unit grant letter to the Eligible Director from the Corporation (a " Deferred Share Unit Grant Letter"). Such Deferred Share Unit Grant Letter shall be subject to all applicable terms and conditions of the Plan and may be subject to any other terms and conditions which are not inconsistent with the Plan and which the Committee deems appropriate for inclusion in a Deferred Share Unit Grant Letter. The provisions of the various Deferred Share Unit Grant Lette rs issued under the Plan need not be identical. 
 
 Section 3.09     Change of Control: If there is a Change of Control, all Deferred Share Units outstanding shall immediately vest on the date of such Change of Control. In any event, upon a Change of Control, Eligible Directors shall not be treated any more favourably than shareholders of the Corporation with respect to the consideration that the Eligible Directors would be entitled to receiv e for their Shares. 
 
 Section 3.10     Termination of Unvested Deferred Share Units: All Deferred Share Units that have not vested prior to the Eligible Director's Separation from Service or Termination Date, as applicable, will terminate and be of no further for ce and effect.
