 CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY   NOTE 
   
 FOR VALUE RECEIVED, M AX  S OUND  C ORPORATION ,  a  Delaware corporation (the " Borrower "), hereby   promises  to pay  to  the  order  of  I LIAD  R ESEARCH AND  T RADING , L.P.,  a  Utah limited partnership,   or   registered assigns (the " Holder "),  the sum of  $171,665.00 (the " Original Principal Amount ") together with  any  additional charges provided  for  herein,  on the  date that  is 12  months after  the  Issue Date (the " Maturity Date "),  and to  pay interest  on the  Outstanding Balance   (as   defined below)  at  the rate  of  eight percent  (8%) per  annum  from the date  hereof  (the  " Issue Date ") until  the  same  is paid  in full;   provided  that  upon  the occurrence  of an  Event  of  Default  (as  defined below), interest shall thereafter accrue  on  the Outstanding Balance both  before  and after judgment  at the  rate   of   fourteen percent (14%) per  annum (" Default  Interest "). All interest calculations hereunder shall  be  computed  on the  basis   of  a  360-day year comprised   of twelve   (12) thirty  (30) day  months, shall compound  daily and  shall  be  payable  in  accordance with the   terms  of this  Note. The Borrower acknowledges that  the  Original Principal Amount exceeds the purchase price   of   this   Note  and  that such excess consists  of the  OID  (as  defined  in  the Purchase Agreement (defined below)) in  the  amount   of 
 $16,665.00, the Carried Transaction Expense Amount (as defined  in the  Purchase   Agreement)  in  the amount  of  $5,000.00  to  cover  the  Holder's legal  and  other expenses incurred in  the  preparation  of this  Note, the Purchase Agreement,  the Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions, and all other certificates, documents, agreements, resolutions  and  instruments delivered  to any  party under   or  in  connection   with   this Note, as  the  same   may  be  amended from time  to  time   (collectively,  the " Transaction  Documents "), which  sum  shall  be  fully earned  and  charged  to the  Borrower upon the execution  of  this Note  and  paid  to the  Holder  as  part   of   the outstanding principal balance  as  set forth  in  this Note. This Note   may  not be  prepaid  in  whole  or  in part  except as  otherwise provided  in  Section 1.8. All payments  due  hereunder (to  the  extent  not  converted  into  common   stock, $0.00001 par value per share,  of the  Borrower  (the  " Common Stock ")  in  accordance with the   terms   hereof) shall   be   made  in  lawful money  of the  United States  of  America.   All   payments shall  be  made  at  such address  as  the Holder shall designate  from  time  to  time  by  written notice made  in  accordance with the provisions  of  this Note. Each capitalized  term used  herein,  and  not otherwise defined, shall have  the  meaning ascribed thereto  in  that certain Securities Purchase Agreement dated  the  date   hereof between   the   Borrower  and  the Holder, pursuant to which this Note   was originally   issued (the " Purchase Agreement ").  For  purposes hereof,  the  term " Outstanding Balance " means the Original Principal Amount,  as  reduced   or   increased,  as  the case   may  be,  pursuant to  the  terms  hereof  for conversion, breach hereof  or otherwise,  plus  any  accrued  but  unpaid   interest   (including with limitation Default Interest), collection  and  enforcements costs,  and  any other fees   or   charges incurred under this Note or under the Purchase Agreement. 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 This Note  is  free from  all  taxes, liens, claims  and  encumbrances with respect  to the  issue thereof  and  shall not  be  subject  to  preemptive rights   or   other similar rights  of  stockholders  of the  Borrower and will  not  impose personal liability  upon the  holder thereof. 
   
 The  following additional   terms  shall  apply  to  this Note: 
   
 1. CONVERSION RIGHTS. 
   
 Conversion Right . Subject  to  Section  1.7,  during the period beginning  on  the Issue Date  and  ending when  the  Outstanding  Balance is  paid  or  converted  in  full,  the  Holder shall,  at  its option, have the right from time  to  time,  to  convert all  or any  part   of   the Outstanding  Balance  of   this Note  into  fully paid  and  non-assessable shares  of  Common   Stock,  as  such   Common   Stock exists   on  the  Issue Date,  or any  shares  of  capital stock  or  other securities  of the  Borrower into which  such  Common  Stock  shall hereafter   be   changed  or  reclassified  at the  Conversion Price (as defined below) determined as provided herein  (a  " Conversion ").  The  number  of  shares   of Common  Stock to be  issued upon each conversion   of   this   Note   (the " Conversion Shares ") shall  be  determined  by  dividing the Conversion Amount  (as  defined below)  by the  applicable Conversion Price then  in  effect  on  the date specified  in  the notice   of   conversion, in the  form  attached hereto  as  Exhibit   A   (the " Notice   of   Conversion "), delivered to  the  Borrower  by the  Holder  in  accordance with Section 1.4(a) below; provided that  the  Notice  of  Conversion is submitted  by  facsimile  or  e-mail (or  by  other means resulting in,   or   reasonably expected  to  result  in,  notice)  to the  Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time  on such  conversion date  (the  " Conversion Date ").  The  term " Conversion Amount " means, with respect to  any  conversion  of  this Note, the portion   of  the  Outstanding Balance  to  be   converted. 
   
 Conversion Price . 
   
 (a)                   Calculation   of   Conversion  Price .  The conversion price  (as the  same may  be  adjusted  from  time  to  time  pursuant to  the   terms  hereof, the  " Conversion Price ") shall mean  65%  (the " Conversion Factor ") multiplied  by the  Market Price  (as  defined herein).  " Market  Price " means  the  average  of  the two  (2)  lowest Trading Prices  (as  defined below)  for the  Common  Stock  during  the ten 
 (10) Trading  Day  (as  defined below) period ending  on the  latest complete  Trading  Day  prior to  the Conversion Date.   If  an Event of  Default  (as  defined below) other than  an  Event  of  Default pursuant to Section 3.1(i) occurs, then the Conversion Factor will  be  reduced  to  55%.   If  an  Event  of  Default pursuant  to  Section 3.1(i) occurs, then the Conversion Factor will  be  reduced  to  40%. " Trading Price " means, for  the  Common  Stock as of  any  date,  the closing  bid  price  on the  Principal  Market as  reported  by a  reliable reporting service designated  by the  Holder (e.g. Bloomberg)  or, if  the Principal Market  is  not the principal trading market  for such  security,  the  closing  bid  price  of such  security  on the  principal securities exchange   or  trading  market where  such  security is listed  or  traded or,  if no  closing bid price   of   such security  is  available  in any of  the foregoing manners, the average  of the  closing  bid  prices  of any  market makers  for such  security that are quoted  in  "OTC   Pink"  by Pink  OTC Markets Inc. (formerly  Pink  Sheets LLC),  or any  successor entity  or  other publisher thereof.   If  the  Trading Price cannot  be  calculated for  such  security  on such  date  in the  manner provided above,  the  Trading Price shall  be  the fair market value  as  mutually determined  by the  Borrower  and the  Holder.  " Trading  Day " shall mean  any day on  which  the  Common  Stock is  traded   or   tradable for  any  period  on  the Principal Market,  or on the  principal securities exchange  or  other securities market  on  which  the  Common  Stock is  then  being  traded. 
   
 (b)                  Conversion Price During Major Announcements . Notwithstanding anything contained  in  Section 1.2(a) to  the  contrary,  in  the event  the  Borrower (i)   makes  a  public announcement that  it  intends  to  consolidate  or  merge   with any  other  corporation (other  than a  merger  in  which the Borrower is  the  surviving  or  continuing corporation and its capital stock  is  unchanged)  or  sell  or  transfer all or substantially  all of the  assets   of   the Borrower   or   (ii)  any  person, group  or  entity 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 (including the Borrower) publicly announces  a  tender offer  to  purchase  50% or  more  of the  Borrower's   Common  Stock (or any  other takeover scheme) (the date   of   the announcement referred  to  in clause (i)   or 
 (ii)  is  hereinafter referred to  as the  " Announcement Date "),  then  the Conversion  Price  shall, effective  upon  the Announcement Date  and  continuing through  the  Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date  (as  defined below),  be  equal  to  the lower  of  (1) the Conversion Price which would have  been  applicable  for a  Conversion occurring  on the  Announcement Date,  and  (2) the Conversion Price that would otherwise  be in  effect.  From and  after the Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date,  the  Conversion Price shall  be  determined as set forth  in  this Section 1.2(b). For purposes hereof, " Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date " shall mean, with respect  to any  proposed transaction  or  tender offer (or takeover scheme)  for  which  a  public announcement  as  contemplated  by  this Section 1.2(b) has been made,  the  date  upon  which  the  Borrower  (in  the case  of  clause (i) above)  or  the person, group  or  entity (in  the  case  of  clause (ii) above) consummates  or  publicly  announces  the termination  or  abandonment  of  the proposed transaction  or  tender offer (or takeover scheme) which caused this Section 1.2(b)  to  become operative. 
   
 Authorized Shares .  The  Borrower covenants that during  the  period the conversion right exists,   the   Borrower will reserve from  its  authorized  and  unissued   Common  Stock a  sufficient   number  of  shares, free from preemptive rights,  to  provide for the issuance  of  Common  Stock upon the  full conversion  of  this Note. The Borrower  is  required  at  all   times  to  have authorized and reserved three times  the  number  of  shares that  is  actually issuable  upon  full conversion   of   this   Note   (based  on the  Conversion Price  in  effect  from  time  to  time)  (the  " Reserved Amount ").  The  Reserved Amount shall   be   increased  from  time  to  time  as  required to insure compliance   with   this Section  1.3. The  Borrower represents that upon issuance, such shares will  be  duly  and  validly issued, fully paid  and non-  assessable.   In   addition, if  the  Borrower shall issue  any  securities  or  make  any  change  to its  capital structure which would change  the  number   of   shares  of  Common  Stock into  which this Note shall   be   convertible at  the  then current Conversion Price, the Borrower shall at  the  same   time   make   proper provision  so  that thereafter there shall  be a  sufficient number  of shares  of   Common  Stock  authorized  and  reserved, free from preemptive rights,  for  conversion  of  this Note. The Borrower  (i)  acknowledges that it  has  irrevocably instructed  its  transfer agent  to  issue shares  of  the  Common Stock  issuable upon conversion  of  this Note, and (ii) agrees that  its  issuance  of  this Note shall constitute full authority  to  its officers  and  agents who   are   charged with the duty  of  issuing  the  necessary shares  of  Common  Stock in  accordance with the terms  and  conditions  of  this   Note. If,  at any  time  the  Borrower  does  not maintain the Reserved Amount it will   be   considered an Event   of   Default under Section 3.1(c). 
   
 Method of   Conversion . 
   
 (a)                   Mechanics   of   Conversion . Subject  to  Section 1.7 hereof, beginning  on the  date   specified  in  Section  1.1,  this Note   may  be  converted  by  the Holder  in  whole   or  in  part at  any  time  from  time  to  time after the Issue Date,  by  submitting  to the  Borrower  a  Notice  of  Conversion  (by  facsimile, e-mail  or  other reasonable means  of  communication dispatched  on the  Conversion Date prior to  6:00  p.m., New York, New York time), otherwise  the  Conversion Date   will  be  the next Trading Day. 
   
 (b)                  Surrender   of  Note   Upon  Conversion .  Notwithstanding anything  to  the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion   of   this   Note  in  accordance with the   terms   hereof,  the  Holder shall not   be   required to physically surrender this Note  to the  Borrower unless the entire Outstanding Balance  of  this Note is  so  converted.  The  Holder  and the  Borrower shall maintain records showing the amount  of  the Outstanding Balance  so  converted and the dates   of   such conversions  or  shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory  to  the   Holder  and the  Borrower,  so as  not  to  require physical surrender   of   this Note upon  each  such conversion.   In  the  event   of  any  dispute  or  discrepancy,  such  records   of   the Holder shall,  prima facie,  be  controlling  and  determinative  in  the absence  of  manifest error. Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if any  portion   of   this Note  is converted as  aforesaid,  the  Holder   may  not 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 transfer this Note unless the Holder first physically surrenders this   Note  to  the Borrower, whereupon the Borrower will forthwith issue and deliver upon the  order of  the Holder  a  new Note  of  like tenor, registered  as  the Holder may  request,  representing  in the  aggregate  the  remaining Outstanding Balance   of   this Note. The   Holder   and  any  assignee,  by  acceptance   of   this Note, acknowledge  and  agree that,  by  reason  of  the provisions   of   this paragraph, following  conversion  of  a  portion  of  this Note,  the  unpaid and unconverted Outstanding Balance   of   this Note represented  by  this Note   may  be  less than  the  amount stated on the face hereof. 
   
 (c)                   Payment   of Taxes .  Borrower   is responsible  for  the payment  of  all charges, fees, and taxes required to deliver Conversion Shares  to  Holder;  provider, however , that Borrower shall not  be  required  to pay any tax  which may  be  payable  in  respect  of any  transfer involved in  the  issue and delivery  of  Conversion Shares  or  other securities   or   property  on conversion of  this Note  in a  name  other  than that   of  the  Holder (or in street name),  and  the Borrower shall not  be  required  to  issue   or   deliver  any such  shares  or  other securities  or  property  unless  and until the person  or  persons (other than  the  Holder  or the  custodian  in  whose street   name  such  shares are  to  be   held   for   the Holder's account) requesting  the  issuance thereof shall have paid  to the  Borrower the amount  of  any  such  tax   or   shall have established  to  the satisfaction  of the  Borrower that such  tax has  been paid. 
   
 (d)                  Delivery   of  Common   Stock Upon  Conversion .  On   or   before  the  close  of  business  on the  third  (3 rd )  Trading Day following  the  date   of   receipt  of a  Notice  of  Conversion from the Holder via facsimile transmission  or  e-mail (or other reasonable means   of   communication) (the " Delivery Date"), the Borrower shall, provided that all DWAC Eligible Conditions (as defined below) are then satisfied, credit  the  aggregate number  of  Conversion Shares to which  the  Holder   shall  be  entitled to   the   account specified  on  the Conversion Notice via  the  DWAC (as defined   below)  system.  If  all  DWAC   Eligible Conditions are not then satisfied,  the  Borrower   shall instead issue and deliver   or   cause  to  be   issued and delivered (via reputable overnight courier)  to the  address  as specified in the  Notice of   Conversion,  a  certificate, registered  in  the name  of the  Holder  or  its designee, for  the  number  of  Conversion Shares  to  which  the  Holder shall  be  entitled;  provided, however , that,  in  addition  to any  other rights   or   remedies that   the   Holder   may   have  under  this   Note,  then the  Non-DWAC Eligible   Adjustment   Amount (as defined below) shall  be added to the  Outstanding Balance   of   this   Note  as  set forth  in  Section   1.6(f) below.  For the  avoidance   of   doubt, the Borrower has  not  met   its   obligation  to  deliver Conversion Shares  by the  Delivery Date unless  the  Holder   or   its broker,  as  applicable, has actually received  the  shares electronically  into the  applicable account,   or   if the DWAC Eligible Conditions  are  not then satisfied, has actually received  the  certificate representing  the  applicable Conversion Shares   no   later than the close   of   business  on  the relevant Delivery Date pursuant  to  the   terms  set forth  above.  For  purposes hereof, the  term  " DWAC Eligible Conditions " means that (i) the   Common  Stock is  eligible at DTC (as defined below) for full services pursuant  to  DTC's   operational arrangements, including without limitation transfer through   DTC's   DWAC system, (ii)  the  Borrower has  been  approved (without revocation)  by  the   DTC's   underwriting department, (iii) the Borrower's transfer agent  is  approved  as an  agent  in the  DTC/FAST   Program  (as  defined below),   (iv)  the  Conversion Shares are otherwise eligible for delivery via DWAC,  and  (v)  the  Borrower's transfer agent does  not  have  a  policy prohibiting  or  limiting delivery  of the  Conversion Shares via   DWAC.  For  purposes   of   this Note,  the  term  " DWAC "  means Deposit Withdrawal  at  Custodian  as  defined  by the  DTC;   the term " DTC " means  the  Depository Trust Company;  and  the  term 
 " DTC/FAST Program " means  the  DTC's   Fast   Automated   Securities Transfer   Program. 
   
 (e)                   Obligation   of  Borrower  to  Deliver   Common  Stock .  If  the  Holder   shall have   given  a  Notice  of  Conversion  as  provided herein,  the  Borrower's   obligation  to  issue  and  deliver the shares  of  Common  Stock shall be  absolute  and  unconditional, irrespective  of the  absence  of any  action  by the  Holder   to enforce  the  same,  any  waiver  or  consent with respect  to any  provision  thereof, the  recovery  of any  judgment against  any person  or  any  action  to  enforce  the  same,  any  failure  or  delay  in  the enforcement   of  any  other obligation  of  the Borrower to the holder   of   record,  or  any setoff, counterclaim, 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 recoupment, limitation  or  termination,  or any  breach   or   alleged breach  by the  Holder  of any  obligation  to the  Borrower, and irrespective  of any  other circumstance which   might   otherwise   limit  such  obligation   of  the  Borrower  to the  Holder  in  connection with  such  conversion.  The  Conversion Date specified in  the  Notice   of   Conversion shall  be  the Conversion Date  so  long  as  the Notice  of  Conversion is delivered  to  the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time,  on such  date; otherwise, the Conversion   Date   shall   be   the next Trading Day. Once  the  Holder   may  freely  trade the   Common  Stock  issuable  upon a  conversion  of  this   Note   pursuant  to  and  in  accordance with the terms hereof  (and in the  case  of  any certificates delivered  to  Holder because not all   of   the DWAC Eligible   Conditions   are  then satisfied, once such  certificates have  been  deposited into Holder's brokerage account,   all   legends have  been  removed therefrom,  and the  Common  Stock  represented  by such  certificates is freely tradeable), all rights with respect  to  the portion  of  the Outstanding Balance being  so  converted shall forthwith terminate;  provided, however , that  the  Holder shall  be  deemed  to be the  holder  of  record   of   the   Common  Stock  issuable upon  such  conversion as  of the  date Borrower receives the corresponding Notice   of   Conversion. 
   
 (f)                   Delivery   of  Common  Stock  via  the  DWAC System . Notwithstanding  any other  provision contained herein, failure to deliver via  the  DWAC system any Common  Stock to be  delivered to the Holder under this Section 1.4 shall constitute  a  breach   of   this Agreement  and an  Event   of   Default under Section  3  hereof, including without limitation under Sections 3.1(c)  and  3.1(p). 
   
 (g)                   Failure to Deliver   Common  Stock Prior to  Delivery  Date .  Without  in any  way limiting  the  Holder's right  to  pursue other remedies, including actual damages and/or equitable relief,  the  parties agree that if delivery  of  the   Common  Stock  issuable  upon  conversion  of  this Note is not delivered  as  required  by  Section 1.4(d)  by the  Delivery Date (a " Conversion Default "),  the  Borrower   shall  pay in cash to  the Holder for each calendar  day  beyond  the  Delivery Date that the Borrower fails  to  deliver such   Common  Stock an  amount equal  to  $500  per day  (the " Conversion Default Payment ").  Such cash  amount shall  be paid to  the Holder  by the  fifth  day of the  month following  the  month  in  which  it has  accrued (the " Conversion Default Payment Due   Date ").  In  the  event  such  cash amount  is  not received  by the  Holder  by the  Conversion Default   Payment   Due  Date, at  the option   of  the  Holder (without notice  to the  Borrower),   the   Conversion Default   Payment   shall   be   added  to the  Outstanding Balance  of  this Note,  in  which event interest shall accrue thereon  in  accordance with the   terms  of this  Note  and  such additional principal amount  shall be  convertible  into  Common  Stock in  accordance with  the  terms  of this  Note. The Borrower agrees that  the  right  to  convert  is a  valuable right  to  the Holder.  The  damages resulting  from a  failure,   attempt  to  frustrate,  or  interference with such  conversion  right  are  difficult if  not  impossible  to  quantify. Accordingly  the  parties acknowledge that the liquidated damages provisions contained  in  this Section 1.4(g)  are  justified. 
   
 Concerning the   Shares .  Transfer   of  the  shares  of  Common  Stock  issuable upon conversion  of  this Note  is  restricted and certificates representing  such  shares   may  bear a legend as  set forth in Sections 4.14  of  the Purchase Agreement. 
   
 Effect of   Certain Events . 
   
 (a)                   Fundamental Transaction Consent Right . The Borrower shall not enter  into or be  party  to a  Fundamental Transaction  (as  defined below), unless the Borrower obtains the   prior   written consent   of   the Holder to enter into such Fundamental Transaction. For purposes   of   this   Note,   " Fundamental Transaction " means that (i)  any  "person"   or   "group"  (as  these terms are used for purposes  of  Sections 13(d) and   14(d) of  the 1934  Act  and  the rules  and  regulations promulgated thereunder)  is or  shall become  the  "beneficial owner"  (as  defined  in  Rule 13d-3  under  the  1934  Act), directly  or  indirectly,  of 50% of the  aggregate ordinary voting power represented  by  issued and outstanding voting  stock of the  Borrower,   or   (ii)  (1)  the Borrower  or any of  its subsidiaries shall, directly  or  indirectly,  in one or  more  related  transactions, consolidate  or  merge   with  or into  (whether  or not  the 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 Borrower  or  any  of  its subsidiaries  is  the surviving corporation)  any  other individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association, trust  or  other entity  or organization  (collectively,  " Person "), or  (2) the Borrower   or   any  of  its subsidiaries shall, directly  or  indirectly,  in one or  more related transactions, sell, lease, license, assign, transfer, convey  or  otherwise dispose  of all or  substantially  all of its  respective properties  or  assets  to any  other Person,  or (3) the  Borrower   or   any  of  its subsidiaries shall, directly  or  indirectly,  in  one  or  more related transactions, allow  any  other Person  to  make  a  purchase, tender  or  exchange offer that  is  accepted  by the holders of  more  than  50%  of  the outstanding shares   of   voting  stock of the  Borrower (not including  any shares of  voting  stock of the  Borrower  held by the  Person  or  Persons making  or  party  to, or  associated   or   affiliated with the Persons making  or party to,  such   purchase, tender  or  exchange offer),  or (4) the  Borrower   or  any of  its subsidiaries shall, directly  or  indirectly,  in one or  more related transactions, consummate  a stock or  share purchase agreement   or   other business combination (including, without limitation,  a  reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off  or  scheme  of  arrangement) with  any  other Person whereby such other Person acquires more  than  50%   of  the  outstanding shares  of  voting  stock of the  Borrower (not including  any  shares  of  voting  stock  of   the Borrower held  by the  other  Person or  other Persons making  or party to, or  associated  or  affiliated with the other Persons making  or party to, such  stock  or share  purchase agreement  or  other business combination),  or  (5) the Borrower   or   any  of  its subsidiaries shall, directly  or  indirectly,  in one or  more related transactions, reorganize, recapitalize  or  reclassify the   Common   Stock, other than an increase  in  the number  of  authorized shares  of the  Borrower's Common Stock.  The  provisions  of this  Section 1.6(a) shall  apply  similarly  and  equally  to  successive Fundamental Transactions  and  shall  be  applied without regard  to any  limitations  on  the conversion  of  this Note. As  a  condition  to  pre-approving  any  Fundamental Transaction  in  writing, which approval   may  be  withheld in  the  Holder's sole discretion, Holder   may   require the resulting successor  or  acquiring entity (if not  the  Borrower)  to  assume  by  written instrument  all of  the obligations   of the   Borrower under this   Note  and  all  the  other Transaction Documents with the same effect  as  if such successor  or  acquirer had been   named  as the  Borrower hereto  and  thereto. 
   
 (b)                  Adjustment Due   to  Fundamental Transactions .   If,  at any  time when this Note  is  issued  and  outstanding  and  prior  to  conversion  of all  of   this Note, there shall   be  any  Fundamental Transaction that is pre-approved  in  writing  by the  Holder pursuant  to  Section 1.6(a) above,  as a  result   of   which shares   of Common  Stock of the  Borrower shall  be  changed into  the  same  or a  different number   of   shares  of  another class   or   classes  of  stock  or  securities  of  the Borrower   or   another entity,   or  in  case  of  any  sale  or   conveyance  of  all  or  substantially  all of  the assets  of  the Borrower other than  in  connection with  a plan  of   complete liquidation  of  the Borrower, then the Holder  of  this Note shall thereafter   have  the  right  to  receive  upon  conversion  of  this Note,  upon the  basis  and upon  the   terms  and  conditions specified herein  and in  lieu  of the  shares  of  Common  Stock  immediately theretofore issuable  upon  conversion, such stock, securities   or   assets which the Holder would   have  been  entitled  to receive in  such transaction had this Note been converted in full immediately prior  to such  transaction (without regard  to  any limitations  on  conversion set forth herein),  and in any such  case appropriate provisions shall  be  made with respect  to the  rights and interests   of   the Holder  of  this Note  to  the  end  that  the  provisions hereof (including, without limitation, provisions  for  adjustment  of  the Conversion Price  and of the  number  of  shares issuable upon conversion   of   this Note) shall thereafter  be  applicable,  as  nearly  as  may  be  practicable  in  relation  to any  securities   or   assets thereafter deliverable upon  the  conversion hereof.  The  above provisions shall similarly  apply to  successive Fundamental Transactions. 
   
 (c)                   Adjustment Due   to  Distribution .   If   the Borrower shall declare  or  make  any  distribution  of  its assets (or rights  to  acquire its assets)  to  holders   of   Common Stock  as a  dividend,  stock  repurchase,  by  way  of  return  of  capital  or  otherwise (including  any  dividend  or  distribution  to  the Borrower's stockholders  in cash  or shares (or rights  to  acquire shares)  of  capital stock  of a  subsidiary (i.e.,  a  spin-off))  (a  " Distribution "), then the Holder  of  this Note shall   be   entitled, upon  any conversion  of   this Note after  the  date  of  record for determining stockholders entitled  to such  Distribution,  to  receive the amount  of such  assets which would have  been  payable  to  the Holder with respect  to the  shares   of 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 Common  Stock issuable upon such  conversion had  such  Holder been the holder  of  such shares  of  Common  Stock on the  record date  for the  determination  of  stockholders entitled to  such  Distribution. 
   
 (d)                  Adjustment Due to   Dilutive   Issuance .   If,  at any  time when this   Note  is  issued  and  outstanding, the Borrower issues  or  sells,  or in  accordance with this Section 1.6(d) hereof  is  deemed  to  have issued  or  sold, any shares  of  Common  Stock  for  no  consideration  or  for  a  consideration  per  share (before deduction  of  reasonable expenses  or commissions  underwriting discounts  or  allowances  in  connection therewith) less  than the  Conversion Price  in  effect  on the  date  of  such issuance  (or  deemed issuance)  of such  shares  of  Common  Stock (a  " Dilutive Issuance "), then immediately  upon  the   Dilutive   Issuance,  the  Conversion Price will  be  reduced  to the  amount  of the  consideration  per  share received  by the  Borrower in such   Dilutive   Issuance. 
   
 The  Borrower shall  be  deemed  to  have issued  or sold  shares   of Common  Stock if the  Borrower  in  any manner issues or grants  any  warrants, rights or options (not including employee  stock  option plans), whether   or   not immediately exercisable,  to  subscribe for  or to  purchase   Common  Stock  or   other securities convertible into   or   exchangeable for   Common  Stock (" Convertible  Securities ") (such warrants, rights  and  options  to  purchase   Common  Stock or  Convertible Securities are hereinafter referred  to  as " Options ") and the price per share for which   Common  Stock is  issuable upon the exercise  of  such Options  is  less  than the  Conversion Price  then in  effect, then  the  Conversion Price shall  be  equal  to  such price per share. For purposes   of   the preceding sentence, the "price  per  share for which   Common  Stock is  issuable  upon  the exercise  of such  Options"  is  determined  by  dividing  (i)  the total amount, if any, received  or  receivable  by  the Borrower  as  consideration  for the  issuance   or   granting  of  all such Options,  plus the  minimum aggregate amount  of  additional consideration,  if  any,   payable  to the  Borrower  upon  the exercise  of  all  such  Options,  plus, in  the case  of  Convertible Securities issuable upon  the  exercise  of  such Options, the minimum aggregate amount  of  additional consideration payable  upon  the conversion   or   exchange thereof at  the  time   such Convertible Securities first become convertible  or  exchangeable,  by  (ii)  the  maximum total number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  issuable  upon  the exercise  of  all such   Options   (assuming  full  conversion  of  Convertible Securities, if applicable). No further adjustment  to  the   Conversion Price will   be   made upon  the  actual issuance  of  such   Common  Stock  upon the exercise   of  such  Options  or  upon the conversion  or  exchange  of  Convertible Securities issuable  upon  exercise  of  such Options. 
   
 Additionally,  the  Borrower shall  be  deemed  to  have issued  or  sold shares  of  Common  Stock if the  Borrower  in any  manner issues  or  sells  any  Convertible Securities, whether  or not  immediately convertible,  and the  price per share for which   Common  Stock is  issuable  upon  such conversion  or  exchange  is  less than the Conversion Price then  in  effect,  then the  Conversion Price shall   be  equal  to such price  per  share. For  the  purposes   of  the  preceding sentence, the "price  per  share for which   Common  Stock is  issuable  upon  such conversion  or  exchange"  is  determined   by   dividing  (1)  the total amount,  if  any, received  or  receivable  by the  Borrower  as  consideration  for  the issuance or sale  of  all  such  Convertible Securities, plus  the  minimum aggregate amount  of  additional consideration,  if  any, payable to  the  Borrower upon  the  conversion   or   exchange thereof  at the  time  such  Convertible Securities   first   become convertible  or  exchangeable,  by (2)  the maximum  total  number  of  shares   of Common  Stock  issuable upon  the  conversion  or  exchange   of   all such Convertible Securities. No further adjustment  to the  Conversion Price will   be   made  upon  the actual issuance  of such  Common  Stock upon  conversion   or   exchange of such Convertible Securities. 
   
 (e)                   Purchase Rights .   If,  at any  time  when this  Note  is  issued  and  outstanding,  the  Borrower issues any convertible securities  or  rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities   or   other property  (the  " Purchase Rights ") pro rata  to  the record holders   of  any class of  Common   Stock,  then the  Holder   of   this Note   will be   entitled  to  acquire, upon  the  terms applicable  to  such  Purchase  Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such   Holder   could   have   acquired if such Holder  had  held  the  number   of 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 shares  of  Common  Stock  acquirable  upon  complete conversion  of  this   Note   (without regard  to any  limitations  on  conversion contained herein) immediately  before the  date  on  which  a  record  is  taken  for  the grant, issuance   or   sale   of   such Purchase Rights or,  if no such  record  is  taken, the date  as  of   which   the   record holders of   Common  Stock are to  be   determined  for the  grant, issue  or  sale of such Purchase Rights. 
   
 (f)                   Adjustment Due   to  Non-DWAC Eligibility .   If,  at any  time when this Note  is  issued and outstanding,  the  Holder delivers  a  Notice   of   Conversion  and at such  time all DWAC Eligible Conditions are not  then  satisfied,  the  Borrower shall deliver certificated Conversion Shares  to the  Holder pursuant  to  Section 1.4(d) and the Non-DWAC Eligible Adjustment Amount shall  be added to  the Outstanding  Balance  of   this Note, without limiting  any other  rights  of  the   Holder   under this Note  or  the other Transaction Documents.  The  " Non-DWAC Eligible Adjustment Amount "  is  the amount equal  to the  number  of  applicable Conversion Shares multiplied  by the  excess, if any,  of  (i)  the  Trading Price   of  the  Common  Stock on the  Conversion Date, over (ii) the Trading  Price  of  the  Common  Stock on the date the  certificated Conversion Shares  are  freely tradable, clear   of   any restrictive legend  and  deposited  in  the Holder's brokerage account.   In  any such  case,   Holder   will  use  reasonable efforts  to  timely deposit such certificates  in  its brokerage account after it receives  them and cause such  restrictive legends  to be  removed,  and,  without limiting  any other  provision   hereof, Borrower agrees  to  fully cooperate with Holder  in  accomplishing the same. 
   
 (g)                   Adjustment Due   to  Late Clearing  of  DWAC Eligible  Shares .  If,  at any  time when this Note  is  issued  and  outstanding,  the  Holder delivers  a  Notice  of  Conversion and  at such  time  the  Common  Stock is  DWAC Eligible  and the  applicable DWAC Eligible Conversion Shares are delivered  to  Holder or   its broker, but  it  takes longer  than  five  (5)  business   days   after such delivery  for such  Conversion Shares  to be  electronically cleared for trading in Holder's  brokerage  account, then  the Late  Clearing Adjustment Amount (as defined below) shall   be   added  to  the Outstanding Balance   of   this Note, without limiting  any  other rights  of  the Holder under this   Note or  the  other Transaction Documents.  The  " Late Clearing Adjustment Amount "  is the  amount equal  to the  number   of   applicable Conversion Shares multiplied  by  the excess, if any,  of  (1)  the  Trading Price   of   the   Common  Stock on the  Conversion Date, over  (2) the  Trading  Price  of   the   Common  Stock on  the date  the certificated  DWAC Eligible Conversion Shares are electronically cleared for trading  in the  Holder's   brokerage  account.  In  any such case,  and without limiting  any other  provision hereof,  each of  Holder  and  the Borrower agrees to take  all  action reasonably necessary  on its  part  to  help ensure that the applicable Conversion Shares are electronically cleared for trading  in  the Holder's brokerage account   within  the five-day period  described above. 
   
 (h)                  Notice   of  Adjustments . Upon  the  occurrence  of each  adjustment  or  readjustment   of   the Conversion Price  or  the addition   of   the Non-DWAC Eligible Adjustment Amount   or  Late  Clearing Adjustment Amount  to  the Outstanding Balance  as a  result  of the  events described  in  this Section  1.6,  the Borrower,  at its  expense, shall promptly compute  such  adjustment  or  readjustment  and  prepare  and  furnish  to the  Holder  a  certificate setting forth such adjustment   or   readjustment and showing  in  detail  the  facts  upon  which such adjustment  or  readjustment  is  based.  The  Borrower shall, upon  the  written request at  any  time  of  the Holder, furnish  to such  Holder  a  like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustment   or   readjustment, (ii) the Conversion Price at  the  time  in  effect and (iii) the number   of   shares  of  Common  Stock and the  amount,  if  any,  of  other securities   or   property which  at the  time would   be   received  upon  conversion   of   this Note. 
   
 (i)                    Adjustments for Stock   Split .  Notwithstanding anything herein  to  the contrary,  any  references  to  share numbers  or  share prices shall   be   appropriately adjusted for any  stock  dividend, stock split, stock combination  or  other similar transaction. 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
 Ownership Limitation . Notwithstanding anything  to  the contrary contained  in  this Note   or  the  other Transaction Documents,  if at any  time  the  Holder   shall   or   would   be   issued shares  of  Common  Stock under any of the  Transaction Documents,  but such  issuance would cause  the  Holder   (together with its Affiliates)  to  beneficially own  a  number  of shares  exceeding  4.99% of the  number   of   shares   of Common  Stock  outstanding  on such  date (including  for  such purpose  the  shares   of Common  Stock  issuable  upon  such issuance) (the " Maximum Percentage "), then the Company must  not  issue  to the  Holder shares  of  the Common  Stock  which would  exceed the  Maximum Percentage.  For  purposes  of  this Section, beneficial ownership  of  Common  Stock  will  be  determined under the 1934 Act. The shares  of  Common  Stock  issuable  to  the Holder that would cause  the  Maximum Percentage  to be exceeded  are   referred  to  herein as  the  " Ownership Limitation Shares ". The Company will reserve the   Ownership   Limitation Shares for the exclusive benefit   of   the Holder. From time  to  time,  the  Holder   may  notify  the Company  in  writing  of  the number  of  the Ownership Limitation Shares that   may  be  issued  to  the   Holder   without causing  the  Holder  to  exceed the Maximum Percentage. Upon receipt  of such  notice, the Company  shall  be   unconditionally obligated  to  immediately issue such designated shares  to  the Holder, with  a  corresponding reduction  in the  number  of  the Ownership Limitation Shares. Notwithstanding  the  forgoing,  the  term "4.99%" above shall   be   replaced with "9.99%" at such time  as the  Market Capitalization   of  the  Common  Stock is  less  than  $5,000,000.00. Notwithstanding  any other  provision contained herein, if  the  term  "4.99%"  is replaced   with   "9.99%" pursuant  to the  preceding sentence, such increase  to  "9.99%" shall remain  at  9.99% until increased, decreased  or  waived  by the  Holder  as  set forth below.   For   purposes   of this   Note,  the  term  " Market  Capitalization   of  the  Common  Stock "  shall mean  the  product equal  to  (A) the average  VWAP  of  the  Common  Stock for  the immediately preceding fifteen 
 (15)  Trading Days, multiplied  by  (B)  the  aggregate number  of outstanding  shares  of  Common  Stock as  reported  on the  Company's most recently filed Form  10-Q or Form 10-K. By  written notice  to  the Company,  the  Holder   may   increase, decrease   or   waive  the  Maximum Percentage  as to  itself but  any such  waiver will not  be  effective  until the  61st  day  after delivery thereof.  The  foregoing  61-day notice  requirement is enforceable, unconditional  and  non-waivable  and  shall apply  to all  Affiliates  and  assigns  of  the Holder. 
   
 Prepayment .  So  long  as  the Borrower has not received  a  Notice of   Conversion  from the  Holder,  then  at any time  during the period  beginning  on the  Issue Date  and  ending  on the  date which  is  one hundred eighty  (180)  calendar days following  the  Issue Date,  the  Borrower shall have  the  right, exercisable  on  not less than  thirty  (30) Trading   Days   prior   written   notice  to  the Holder  to  prepay the Outstanding Balance   of   this Note, in full, in accordance with this Section  1.8.  Any   notice of prepayment hereunder  (an  " Optional Prepayment Notice ") shall  be  delivered  to the  Holder at its registered addresses  and  shall state: (a) that the Borrower  is  exercising  its  right  to  prepay  this  Note,  and  (b) the date  of  prepayment, which shall  be  not more  than  three (3) Trading Days  from  the date  of  the Optional Prepayment Notice. On  the date  fixed  for  prepayment  (the  " Optional Prepayment Date "), the Borrower shall   make   payment  of  the Optional Prepayment Amount  (as  defined below)  to or  upon the order   of  the  Holder as specified  by the  Holder in writing  to  the Borrower  at  least  one (1)  Trading Day  prior to  the Optional Prepayment Date.   If  the  Borrower exercises its right  to  prepay this Note,  the  Borrower shall   make   payment  to the  Holder  of an  amount  in  cash (the " Optional Prepayment Amount ") equal  to  120%, multiplied  by the  then Outstanding Balance  of  this Note.   If  the  Borrower delivers  an  Optional Prepayment Notice  and  fails  to  pay  the  Optional Prepayment Amount  due to the  Holder within   two  (2)  Trading Days following  the  Optional Prepayment Date, the Borrower shall forever forfeit its right  to  prepay  this  Note pursuant  to  this Section 1.8.

Any consent  to the  disposition  of any  assets may  be  conditioned  on a  specified use  of the  proceeds  of  disposition. 
   
 Advances and Loans . So  long  as the  Borrower shall have  any  obligation under this Note,  the  Borrower shall not, without  the  Holder's   written consent, lend money,   give   credit   or make   advances  to  any  person,  firm, joint venture  or  corporation, including, without limitation, officers, directors, employees, subsidiaries  and  Affiliates   of  the  Borrower, except loans, credits  or  advances (a) in existence  or  committed  on the  date hereof  and  which  the  Borrower  has  informed   Holder  in  writing prior  to  the date hereof,  (b)  made  in  the ordinary course   of   business,   or   (c)  not in  excess  of  $100,000.

The Default Effects shall automatically  apply upon  the occurrence   of  an  Event  of  Default without the need  for any  party  to  give  any  notice  or  take  any other  action. Further,  upon  the occurrence  and  during  the  continuation  of any  Event   of   Default, the Holder   may  by  written notice  to  the Borrower declare the entire Outstanding Balance immediately  due  and payable without presentment, demand, protest  or any  other notice   of  any  kind, all   of   which are hereby  expressly  waived, anything contained herein   or   in the other Transaction Documents  to the  contrary notwithstanding;  provided ,  however ,   that  upon the  occurrence  or  existence  of any  Event  of  Default described  in  Sections 3.1(e), 3.1(g), 3.1(j),  or  3.1(k), immediately  and  without notice, all outstanding obligations payable  by the  Borrower  hereunder  shall automatically become immediately  due and  payable, without presentment, demand, protest  or any  other notice   of   any kind,  all  of   which are  hereby  expressly waived, anything contained herein  or in the  Transaction Documents  to the  contrary (" Automatic Acceleration ").

 Fees and  Charges .  The  parties acknowledge and agree that  upon  the Borrower's failure  to  comply with  the  provisions  of  this Note, the Holder's damages would   be   uncertain and difficult  (if  not impossible)  to  accurately estimate because   of   the parties' inability to predict future interest rates,  the  Holder's increased   risk,  and the  uncertainty  of  the availability  of a  suitable substitute investment opportunity  for  the Holder, among  other  reasons. Accordingly,  any fees,  charges,  and  interest due under this Note  are  intended  by  the parties  to  be, and  shall be  deemed,  a  reasonable estimate  of  the   Holder's   actual loss  of  its investment opportunity  and  not  a  penalty,  and  shall  not be  deemed  in any  way  to  limit  any other  right  or  remedy Holder   may   have hereunder,  at law or in  equity. 
   
 Remedies . The Borrower acknowledges that  a  breach  by it of its  obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm  to the  Holder,   by   vitiating  the  intent  and  purpose   of   the transaction contemplated hereby. Accordingly,  the  Borrower acknowledges that the remedy   at  law  for  a  breach  of  its   obligations  under  this  Note  will  be  inadequate  and  agrees,  in  the event  of a  breach  or  threatened breach  by the  Borrower   of  the  provisions  of  this Note, that the Holder shall  be  entitled,  in  addition  to  all other available remedies  at law  or  in  equity,  and in  addition  to the  charges assessable herein,  to an  injunction   or   injunctions restraining, preventing  or  curing  any breach of  this Note  and to  enforce specifically  the  terms  and  provisions thereof, without the necessity  of  showing economic loss  and  without  any bond  or   other security  being  required. 
   
 Purchase Agreement . By   its   acceptance   of   this Note,  each  party agrees  to be bound by the  applicable   terms  of the  Purchase Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. 
   
 Notice of  Corporate Events . Except  as  otherwise   provided   herein, the Holder   of   this Note shall   have  no  rights  as a  Holder  of  Common  Stock  unless and only  to the  extent that  it  converts this Note into   Common   Stock. The Borrower shall provide the Holder with   prior   notification  of  any meeting  of the  Borrower's stockholders (and copies  of  proxy materials and other information sent to stockholders).   In  the  event  of any  taking  by the  Borrower  of a  record  of its  stockholders for the purpose   of   determining stockholders who  are  entitled  to  receive  payment of any  dividend  or  other distribution,  any  right  to  subscribe  for,  purchase  or  otherwise acquire (including  by  way  of  merger, consolidation, reclassification  or  recapitalization)  any  share  of any  class   or  any  other securities  or  property,  or to receive any other  right,  or  for the purpose  of  determining stockholders   who   are entitled to vote  in  connection with  any  proposed sale, lease   or   conveyance  of  all   or   substantially all   of   the assets  of  the Borrower   or  any  proposed liquidation, dissolution   or   winding  up of the  Borrower, the Borrower shall mail  a  notice  to  the   Holder,  at  least twenty (20) calendar days   prior   to the record date specified therein  (or  thirty  (30)  calendar days prior  to  the consummation   of  the  transaction  or  event, whichever  is earlier),  of   the date   on   which  any such  record is  to  be   taken for the purpose  of  such dividend, distribution, right   or   other event, and  a  brief statement regarding  the  amount  and  character  of  such dividend, distribution, right  or  other event  to  the extent known  at  such time.  The  Borrower shall   make  a  public announcement  of any  event requiring notification to  the  Holder hereunder substantially simultaneously with  the  notification  to  the Holder  in  accordance with  the  terms  of  this Section  4.10.
