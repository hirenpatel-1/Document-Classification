NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of Lender's agreement to the amendments set forth in this Amendment and the covenants, warranties and representations of Borrower contained herein, Ten Dollars ($10.00) and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged by all parties, it is agreed as follows: 
   
 AGREEMENTS 
   
The recitals set forth above are not mere recitals of fact but are contractual in nature and are intended by the parties to be incorporated into this Amendment by reference, except in the event of a conflict between the incorporated recitals and the numbered sections of this Amendment, the numbered sections of this Amendment shall control. Terms and provisions which are not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings as set forth in the Loan Agreement. 
   
 1.            Consolidation of Loans. The USC Loan and the Tribute Loan are hereby combined and consolidated into a single loan ("Consolidated Loan"). The outstanding principal balance of the Consolidated Loan is $1,152,890.33. The Consolidated Loan shall bear interest from September 30, 2016 at three and 75/100 percent (3.75%) per annum, and the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest shall be payable on demand, but in the absence of demand, in sixty (60) monthly installments of principal plus accrued interest beginning on November 1, 2016, the first fifty nine (59) of which shall be in the amount of $33,939.90 each (as shown on the amortization schedule attached hereto as  Exhibit A), with the outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest becoming due with the 60th and final installment. All installments shall be applied first against accrued interest through the date of payment and the balance of such installment shall be applied to reduce the outstanding principal balance hereunder. 
   
 2.            Consolidation of Notes. The Borrowers have executed and delivered to Lender a Consolidated Promissory Note ("Consolidated Note"), dated effective September 30, 2016, which replaces and supersedes the USC Note (Loan No. 5000028406) and the Tribute Note (Loan No. 5000024132) ("Original Notes"). The Consolidated Note evidences a modification and continuation of the terms of the original indebtedness, evidenced by the Original Notes, including but not limited to, the modification in payment and interest terms set forth in Section 1 above. All security for the Original Notes shall be applicable to the indebtedness as now evidenced by the Consolidated Note, as amended herein. 
   
 3.            Addition of Adamis as Co-Borrower under the Consolidated Loan. Effective as of the date hereof, without the necessity of further documentation by the parties hereto, the Consolidated Loan shall be deemed to be amended to add Adamis as a co-borrower under the Consolidated Loan, with the intention that, pursuant to such amendment, Adamis shall assume responsibility as borrower for all obligations, duties and liabilities under the Consolidated Loan, jointly and severally with the original borrower or borrowers under the USC Loan and Tribute Loan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties expressly agree each of the Loan Parties shall remain, as applicable, a co-borrower under the Consolidated Loan as set forth immediately prior to execution of this Amendment, and accordingly: (a) each of the Loan Parties' rights under the USC Loan and the Tribute Loan shall not be affected, nor shall they be relieved of their obligations, duties and liabilities thereunder, and (b) each of the Loan Parties shall continue to be bound by all of the terms, provisions and conditions contained in the USC Loan documents and the Tribute Loan document s. 
   
 
 
 2   
 
 
   
 
 
   
 3.            Assumption. Effective as of the date of this Amendment, Adamis hereby accepts the foregoing assumption of rights, obligations, duties and liabilities and assumes and agrees to pay and to perform, jointly and severally with each of the Loan Parties (as applicable) all of the obligations, duties and liabilities as an original borrower under the Consolidated Loan, whether accruing on or after the date hereof, and further agrees that Adamis shall hereafter be bound by all of the terms, provisions and conditions contained in the USC Loan documents and the Tribute Loan documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing assumption by Adamis, each respective security agreement or security interest issued in connection with the Consolidate d Loan will apply only to the assets of the entity named therein. 
   
 4.             Estoppel; Waiver; Ratification and Release. For and in consideration of the maturity extension granted by Lender, Ten United States Dollars ($10.00) and other good and valuable consideration, receipt and sufficiency being acknowledged, Borrowers, as evidenced by their respective signatures below, agree and acknowledge unqualified and unconditional obligation for the Indebtedness without defense, affirmative defense, counterclaim, right of setoff or other impediment to collection, and the same, if existing, being expressly released and waived by Borrowers in consideration for  Lender entering into this Amendment. 
   
 5.             UCC. Notwithstanding any provisions hereof or execution by Lender, this Amendment (and all documents executed in connection herewith) shall be voidable at the option of Lender should any lien searches or other confirmatory title information regarding the Collateral (to be provided at the expense of Borrower) reflect any default under the Loan or creation of any adverse claim or interest regarding the Collateral. In addition, Borrower authorizes Lender to file any and all initial, amendatory or continuation Uniform Commercial Code filings  deemed necessary by Lender, without necessity of consent by Borrower. 
   
 6.            Good Standing of Borrower. Notwithstanding any provisions hereof or execution by Lender, this Amendment (and all documents executed in connection herewith) shall be voidable at the option of Lender in the event Borrower is not validly existing and under its state of formation at the time of execution of this Amendment. 
   
 7.             Continuation. All of the USC Loan documents and Tribute Loan documents are hereby modified to reflect the terms of this Amendment, and shall continue in full force and effect until the maturity of the Consolidated Note, and any extension or renewals thereof. All other provisions of the loan documents, not specifically modified herein, shall remain in full force and effe ct.
