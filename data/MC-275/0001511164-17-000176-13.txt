 VII.3 
 Notice of Indemnification 
.  Promptly after the receipt by any indemnified party (the "Indemnitee") of notice of the commencement of any action or proceeding against such Indemnitee, such Indemnitee shall, if a claim with respect thereto is or may be made against any indemnifying party (the "Indemnifying Party") pursuant to this Article VII, give such Indemnifying Party written notice of the commencement of such action or proceeding and give such Indemnifying Party a copy of such claim and/or process and all legal pleadings in connection therewith.  The failure to give such notice shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party of any of its indemnification obligations contained in this Article VII, except where, and solely to the extent that, such failure actually and materially prejudices the rights of such Indemnifying Party.  Such Indemnifying Party shall have, upon request within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice, but not in any event after the settlement or compromise of such claim, the right to defend, at its own expense and by its own counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee, any such matter involving the asserted liability of the Indemnitee; provided, however, that if the Indemnitee determines that there is a reasonable probability that a claim may materially and adversely affect it, other than solely as a result of money payments required to be reimbursed in full by such Indemnifying Party under this Article VII or if a conflict of interest exists between Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnitee shall have the right to defend, compromise or settle such claim or suit; and, provided, further, that such settlement or compromise shall not, unless consented to in writing by such Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, be conclusive as to the liability of such Indemnifying Party to the Indemnitee.  In any event, the Indemnitee, such Indemnifying Party and its counsel shall cooperate in the defense against, or compromise of, any such asserted liability, and in cases where the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense, the Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in the defense of such asserted liability at the Indemnitee's own expense.  In the event that such Indemnifying Party shall decline to participate in or assume the defense of such action, prior to paying or settling any claim against which such Indemnifying Party is, or may be, obligated under this Article VII to indemnify an Indemnitee, the Indemnitee shall first supply such Indemnifying Party with a copy of a final court judgment or decree holding the Indemnitee liable on such claim or, failing such judgment or decree, the terms and conditions of the settlement or compromise of such claim.  An Indemnitee's failure to supply such final court judgment or decree or the terms and conditions of a settlement or compromise to such Indemnifying Party shall not relieve such Indemnifying Party of any of its indemnification obligations contained in this Article VII, except where, and solely to the extent that, such failure actually and materially prejudices the rights of such Indemnifying Party.  If the Indemnifying Party is defending the claim as set forth above, the Indemnifying Party shall ha ve the right to settle the claim only with the consent of the Indemnitee.
