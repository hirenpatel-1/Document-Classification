 THIS EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT  (" Agreement ") is made and entered into effective as of April 3, 2014, by and between  Wireless Ronin Technologies, Inc., a Minnesota corporation with a place of business at Baker Technology Plaza, 5929 Baker Road, Suite 475, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55345 (the " Company "), and  John Walpuck , a resident of the State of California (" Executive "). 
   
 BACKGROUND 
   
The Company desires to employ the Executive as its Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and Executive desires to accept such employment. Among other things, this Agreement provides for base compensation for Executive, a term of employment and severance payments in certain circumstances. 
   
 In consideration of the foregoing, the Company and Executive hereby agree as follows: 
   
 Article 1 
EMPLOYMENT 
   
1.01       The Company hereby agrees to employ Executive subject to and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and Executive agrees to such employment as the Company's Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and shall hold such titles under the terms of this Agreement. The parties anticipate that Executive will initially perform his services primarily at the Company's current executive offices in Minnetonka, Minnesota, but that Executive shall also travel on business as advisable and at times work remotely, with the expectation that Executive will use his good-faith business judgment to determine the appropriate locations to effectively perform his services. 
   
1.02       Executive shall generally have the authority, responsibilities, and such duties as are customarily performed by the chief financial officer and chief operating officer of a public company of similar size and industry. Executive shall also render such additional services and duties within the scope of Executive's experience and expertise as may be  reasonably requested of him from time to time by the Board of Directors of the Company (the " Board"). Furthermore, the Board may from time to time in its discretion redefine the duties and responsibilities of Executive as it determines the needs of the Company require, so long  as such duties are generally consistent with the Executive's title. 
   
1.03       Executive shall report to the Board or any committee thereof as the Board shall direct, and shall generally be subject to the direction, orders, and advice of the Board. 
   
 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
   
 Article 2 
BEST EFFORTS OF EXECUTIVE 
   
2.01       Executive shall use his best efforts, judgment, and abilities in the performance of his duties, services and responsibilities for the Company. 
   
2.02       During the term of his employment, Executive shall devote substantially all of his business time and attention (other than during periods of vacation, illness or disability) to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates and shall not engage in any substantial activity inconsistent with the foregoing, whether or not such activity shall be engaged in for pecuniary gain, unless approved by the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive may manage his personal investments, engage in educational, charitable or other community activities, and business advisory capacities as long as such activities do not pose an actual or apparent conflict of interest and do not interfere with Executive's performance of his duties under this Agreement. Executive represents that any outside professional activities with which he is currently involved or reasonably expects to become involved do not conflict with the business and affairs of the Company or interfere with Executive's performance of his duties hereunder. 
   
 Article 3 
TERM AND NATURE OF EMPLOYMENT 
   
3.01       Executive's employment on the basis described in this Agreement shall commence April 3, 2014, and will terminate on the one-year anniversary of that date unless terminated earlier as described in this Agreement. Neither the Company nor Executive shall be obligated to extend the term of this Agreement. However, the initial one-year term shall automatically be extended for successive one-year periods unless the Company or Executive elects not to do so by giving written notice to the other not less than 90 days prior to the en d of the then-current term. 
   
3.02       The terms and conditions of this Agreement may be amended from time to time with the consent of the Company and Executive. All such amendments shall be effective when memorialized by a written agreement between the Company and Executive, following approval by the Board or the Board's Compensation Committee (the " Committee"). Executive's employment with the Company shall at all times be on an "at will" basis, meaning that either Executive or the Company may terminate the employment relationship at any time for any reason or no reason; provided, however, that Executive may be entitled to certain compensation upon termination to the extent provided in Section 6.03. 
   
 Article 4 
COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS 
   
4.01       During the initial term of employment, Executive shall be paid a base salary at an annualized rate of $240,000 per year (" Base Salary"), payable in accordance with the Company's established payroll periods, and reduced by all deductions and withholdings required by law and as otherwise specified by Executive. The Board or Committee agrees to review Executive's performance and compensation in 2015 and annually thereafter. Executive's Base Salary may be increased (but not decreased) in the sole discretion of the Board or Committee; provided, however, that Executive's Base Salary may be reduced in connection with compensation reductions applied to all other senior exe cutives of the Company. 
   
 
 
 
   2   
 
 
   
 
 
   
4.02       During the term of employment, and in addition to payments of Base Salary set forth above, Executive shall be eligible to participate in the performance-based cash bonus (e.g., the 2014 Senior Management Bonus Plan) or equity award plan for senior executives of the Company, at the same relative cash bonus levels as the CEO, based upon achievement  of individual and/or Company goals established by the Board or Committee. 
   
4.03       During the term of employment, Executive shall be entitled to participate in employee benefit plans, policies, programs, perquisites and arrangements, as the same may be provided and amended from time to time, that are provided generally to similarly situated executive employees of the Company, to the extent Executive meets the eligibility and other requirements for any such plan, policy, program, perquisite or arrangement. If Executive elects to not participate in the same health and dental insurance program of the Company that is offered to and participated in by the Company's Chief Executive Officer, if any, then the Company will pay to Executive in cash that portion of the amount paid by the Company for the health and dental benefits of the Chief Executive Officer, which is equal to the proportion that Executive's then-current Base Salary bears to the then-current base sal ary amount paid to the Chief Executive Officer. 
   
4.04       The Company shall reimburse Executive for all reasonable business expenses incurred by Executive in carrying out Executive's duties, services, and responsibilities under this Agreement, subject to Executive's compliance with generally applicable policies, practices and procedures of the Company (as the same may be changed from time to time) with respect to reimbursement for, and submission of expense reports, receipts or similar documentation of, such expenses. 
   
 Article 5 
VACATION AND LEAVE OF ABSENCE

PTO and sick leave and all other leaves of absence will be taken in accordance with the Company's stated personnel policies and upon agreement with the Chief Executive Officer or the Board. Upon termination or expiration of the Executive's employment, Executive shall be entitled to compensation for any accrued, unused PTO time in accordance with the Company's PTO  policy as of date of termination.

 Article 6 
TERMINATION 
   
6.01       The Company may terminate Executive's employment at any time, with or without Cause (as defined in Section 6.07), upon written notice to Executive. For the purposes of this Agreement, an election by the Company not to extend employment pursuant to Section 3.01 shall be deemed a termination without Cause. 
   
6.02       Executive's employment will terminate as of the date of the death or Disability of the Executive. " Disability" shall mean a determination by the Board that Executive is unable to perform the essential functions of his job under this Agreement due to illness, injury, or other condition of a physical or psychological nature, with or without a reasonable accommodation for a period of 90 days in any 12-month period. Such determination shall be made in good faith by the Board, the decision of which shall be conclusive and binding. For clarity, the essential function of Executive's job specifically include, but are not limited to, Executive's cons istent performance of his obligations under Sections 1.02, 2.01, and 2.02 of this Agreement. 
   
 6.03       On any termination of employment, Executive will be entitled to receive: 
   
 (a)Base Salary for services performed through the date of such termination, payable on a pro-rated basis at the end of the month in which termination occurs; 
   
 (b) accrued and unpaid PTO in accordance with Article 5

 (d)a pro-rated portion of any bonus otherwise due under Section 4.02 above, provided such payment is consistent with the terms of such bonus plan. Any such bonus will be pro-rated based upon the number of full months Executive worked in the calendar year in which any such bonus was earned. 
   
If (x) Executive terminates Executive's employment for Good Reason, (y) the Company terminates Executive's employment without Cause, or (z) Executive is an active and full-time employee at the time of a Change in Control (as defined in Section 6.09) and Executive's employment is terminated within 12 months after the Change in Control for any reason (including Good Reason) other than death, Disability or Cause, then, in addition to the amounts set forth in (a), (b), and (c) above, Executive will be paid an amount equal to six months of his Base Salary, less customary withholdings; provided, however, that Executive will be paid an amount equal to 12 months of his Base Salary, less customary withholdings, if a termination giving rise to Executive's right to severance payments hereunder occurs after the one-year anniversary of this Agreement. Such Base Salary will be paid in equal monthly installments, subject to Article 7 of this Agreement. In addition, if Executive is eligible to and elects to continue medical coverage from the Company as provided by law (commonly referred to as COBRA), and continues to pay Executive's portion of the monthly medical insurance premiums, the Company will continue to pay the Company's portion of the monthly medical insurance premiums paid at the time of termination for COBRA coverage for Executive and his eligible dependents for a period of one year after termination of employment. 
   
 
 
 
   4   
 
 
   
 
 
   
Upon a termination for any other reason, including a voluntary resignation without Good Reason or a termination for Cause, Executive will receive only the amounts set forth in (a),  (b) (c) and (d) above. 
   
Notwithstanding the foregoing, all pay and benefits to Executive upon termination will be conditioned on Executive signing and not rescinding a conventional separation agreement and mutual release in substantially the form previously used by the Company (if applicable) , which agreement shall include, at a minimum, a full and general release of all claims (including employment-related claims ) to the greatest extent allowed by applicable law, a covenant not to sue, and an agreement to be reasonably available for consultation and assistance to the Company during any period in which severance is paid, and an agreement to return to the Company all Company property and copies thereof in any form or media. 
   
6.04       During the term of his employment and for 12 months after the date of Executive's termination of employment, (i) Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, make or publish any disparaging statements (whether written or oral) regarding the Company or any of its then-affiliated companies or businesses, or the affiliates, directors, officers, agents, principal shareholders or customers of any of them and (ii) the Company's directors and officers shall not directly or indirectly, make or publish any disparaging statements (whether written or oral) regarding Executive. Information which a Company director or officer or Executive is required to make or disclose regarding the other to comply with laws or regulations, or makes in a pleading on the advice of litigation counsel, and information which a Company director or officer needs to disclose for legitimate business reasons (for example disclosure to the Company's insurers or business associates), shall not constitute a disparaging statement. 
   
6.05       Upon any termination of Executive's employment with the Company, Executive will immediately return to the Company all equipment, property and documents of the Company, including, specifically all property and documents containing any Confidential Information (as defined in Section 8.01). 
   
6.06       Upon any termination of Executive's employment with the Company, Executive shall be deemed to have resigned from all other positions he then holds as an officer, employee or director or other independent contractor of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, unless otherwise agreed by the Company and Executive in writing, and Executiv e will execute all documents reasonably requested of him to confirm such resignations. 
   
 6.07       Any of the following events shall constitute " Cause ":

 (b)any act of material misconduct involving dishonesty which is injurious to the Company, any willful or gross negligence in the performance of duties, or any breach of fiduciary or o ther duty with respect to the Company; 
   
 
 
 
   5   
 
 
   
 
 
   
 (c)any material breach of this Agreement or of the Company's published or written rules, codes or polices; provided, however, that such breach shall not constitute Cause if Executive cures or remedies such breach within 15 days after written notice to Executive, without material harm or loss to the Company, unless (i) such breach is part of a pattern of chronic breaches of the same, which may (but shall not be required to) be evidenced by a report or warning letter given by the Company to Executive; or (ii) such breach is of a nature that is not curable, including situations where the harm or loss to the Company has already occurred or can reasonably be expected to occur and cannot be eliminated by such cure; 
   
 (d)any act of insubordination by Executive; provided, however, an act of insubordination by Executive shall not constitute Cause if Executive cures or remedies such insubordination within 15 days after written notice to Executive, without material harm or loss to the Company, unless (i) such insubordination is a part of a pattern of chronic insubordination, which may be evidenced by a report or warning letter given by the Company to Executive; or (ii) such insubordination is of a nature that it is not curable, including situations where the harm or loss to the Company has already occurred or can reasonably be expected to occur and cannot be eliminated by such cure; 
   
 (e)any disclosure of any Company trade secret or Confidential Information other than for the legitimate business purposes of the Company or as required by law, or conduct constituting unfair competition with respect to the Company, including intentionally inducing a party to breach a contract with the Company; or 
   
 (f) a willful violation of federal or state securities laws or employment laws. 
   
In making such determination of Cause, the Board shall act in good faith and give Executive a reasonably detailed written notice in advance of the termination. A resolution providing for the termination of Executive's employment for Cause must be approved by a majority of the members of the Board; provided, however, that if Executive is a member of the Board, he shall not vote on the resolution shall not be deemed to be a member of the Board for purposes of whether a majority of its members have approved such termination. Executive's employment shall be deemed terminated for Cause upon the approval by the Board of a resolution terminating Executive's employment for Cause unless a later time or date is specified. For purposes of this Agreement, no act or failure by the Executive shall be considered "willful" if such act is done by Executive in good faith in the belief that such act is or was lawful and in the best interest of the Company or one or more of its businesses. In the event of a termination for Cause, and not withstanding any contrary provision otherwise  stated, Executive shall receive only those amounts set forth in Section 6.03(a), (b) (c) and (d). 
   
 
 
 
   6

The Company shall, within such 60-day notice period, have the right to cure or remedy events or any action or event constituting "Good Reason" within the meaning of this Section 6.08. The failure to give such notice shall be deemed a waiver of the right to terminate this Agreement for Good Reason based on such fact or event.

MISCELLANEOUS 
   
10.01       Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed according to the laws of the State of Minnesota without regard to conflicts-of-law provisions. The Company and Executive agree that if any action is brought pursuant to this Agreement that is not otherwise required to be resolved by arbitration pursuant to Section 10.06, such dispute shall be resolved only in the District Court of Hennepin County, Minnesota, or the United States District Court for Minnesota, and each party hereto unconditionally (a) submits for itself in any proceeding relating to this Agreement, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Hennepin County, Minnesota District Courts or the United States Federal District Court for Minnesota, and agrees that all claims in respect to any such proceeding shall be heard and determined in Hennepin County, Minnesota District Court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such federal court, (b) consents that any such proceeding may and shall be brought in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or thereafter have to the venue or jurisdiction of any such proceeding in any such court or that such proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; (c) waives all right to trial by jury in any proceeding (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or its performance under or the enforcement of this Agreement; (d) agrees that service of process in any such proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy of such process by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to such party at its address as provided in Section 10.08; and (e) agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner permitted by the laws of the State of Minnesota. 
   
10.02       Successors. This Agreement is personal to Executive and Executive may not assign or transfer any part of his rights or duties hereunder, or any compensation due to him hereunder, to any other person or entity. This Agreement may be assigned by the Company. The Company shall require any successor or assignee, whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of all or substantially all the business or assets of the Company, expressly and unconditionally to assume and agree to perform the Company's obligations under this Agreement, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession or assignment had taken place. In such event, the term "Company," as used in this Agreement, shall mean the Company as defined above and any successor or assignee to its business or assets that by reason hereof beco mes bound by the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

10.03       Waiver. The waiver by the Company of the breach or nonperformance of any provision of this Agreement by Executive will not operate or be construed as a waiver of any future breach or nonperformance under any such provision or any other provision of this Agreement or any similar agreement with any other Executive. 
   
10.04        Entire Agreement; Modification. This Agreement supersedes, revokes and replaces any and all prior oral or written understandings, if any, between the parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. The parties agree that this Agreement: (a) is the entire understanding and agreement between the parties; and (b) is the complete and exclusive statement of the terms and conditions thereof, and there are no other written or oral agreements in regard to the subject matter of this Agreement. Except for modifications described in Section 1.02, 3.01 and 4.01, this Agreement shall not be changed or modified except by a written document signed by the parties hereto. 
   
10.05       Severability and Blue Penciling. To the extent that any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable as written, the validity and enforceability of the remainder of such provision and of this Agreement shall be unaffected.

10.06       Arbitration. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising under this Agreement shall, at the request of any party hereto be resolved by binding arbitration in Hennepin County, Minnesota by a single arbitrator selected by the Company and Executive, with arbitration governed by The United States Arbitration Act (Title 9, U.S. Code); provided, however, that a dispute, claim or controversy shall be subject to adjudication by a court in any proceeding against the Company or Executive involving third parties (in addition to the Company or Executive). Such arbitrator shall be a disinterested person who is either an attorney, retired judge or labor relations arbitrator. In the event the Company and Executive are unable to agree upon such arbitrator, the arbitrator shall, upon petition by either the Company or Executive, be designated by a judge of the Hennepin County District Court. The arbitrator shall have the authority to make awards of damages as would any court in Minnesota having jurisdiction over a dispute between employer and Executive, except that the arbitrator may not make an award of exemplary damages or consequential damages. In addition, the Company and Executive agree that all other matters arising out of Executive's employm ent relationship with the Company shall be arbitrable, unless otherwise restricted by law.

   13   
 
 
   
 
 
   
 (b)The arbitrator, in his or her discretion, shall award legal fees and expenses and costs of the arbitration, including the arbitrator's fee, to a party who substantially prevails in  its claims in such proceeding. 
   
 (c)Notwithstanding this Section 10.06, in the event of alleged noncompliance or violation, as the case may be, of Articles 8 or 9 of this Agreement, the Company may, at its discretion, alternatively apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, injunctive and/or such other legal and equitable remedies as may be appropriate. 
   
10.07       Legal Fees. If any contest or dispute shall arise between the Company and Executive regarding any provision of this Agreement, and such dispute results in court proceedings or arbitration, a party that prevails with respect to a claim brought and pursued in connection with such dispute shall be entitled to recover its legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred in connection with such dispute. Such reimbursement shall be made as soon as practicable following the resolution of the dispute (whether or not appealed) to the ex tent a party receives documented evidence of such fees and expenses. 
   
10.08       Notices. For purposes of this Agreement, notices and all other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when personally delivered or sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to Executive at his residence address appearing on the records of the Company and to the Company at its then-current executive offices to the attention of the Chief Executive Officer or Board.
