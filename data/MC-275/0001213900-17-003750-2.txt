The Indemnified Party or parties shall have the right to employ its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense  of such Indemnified Party or parties unless ( i) the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding, ( ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not have, within a reasonable period of time in light of the circumstances, employed counsel to defend such Proceeding or ( iii) such Indemnified Party or parties shall have reasonably concluded upon written advice of counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it or them which are different from, additional to or in conflict with those available to such Indemnifying Party (in which case such Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to direct that portion of the defense of such Proceeding on behalf of the Indemnified Party or parties, but such Indemnifying Party or parties may employ counsel and participate in the defense thereof but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party), in any of which events such reasonable fees and expenses shall be borne by such Indemnifying Party and paid as incurred (it being understood, however, that such Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in any one Proceeding or series of related Proceedings in the same jurisdiction representing the Indemnified Parties who are parties to such Proceeding). An Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent but, if settled with its written consent, such Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Party or parties from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Party shall have requested an Indemnifying Party to reimburse the Indemnified Party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second sentence of  this  Section 6(c), then the Indemnifying Party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any Proceeding effected without its written consent if ( i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such Indemnifying Party of the aforesaid request, ( ii) such Indemnifying Party shall not have fully reimbursed the Indemnified Party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement and ( iii) such Indemnified Party shall have given the Indemnifying Party at least 30 days' prior notice of its intention to settle. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened Proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding and does not include an admission of fault or culpability or a failure to act by or on behal f of such Indemnified Party.

 (d)                Contribution . If the indemnification provided for in this  Section 6  is unavailable to an Indemnified Party under  subsections (a)  or  (b)  of this  Section 6 or insufficient to hold an Indemnified Party harmless in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each applicable Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities  or expenses referred to in  subsections (a)  or  (b)  above, ( i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Indemnifying Party or parties on the one hand and the Indemnified Party or parties on the ot her hand from the offering of the Securities or ( ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party or parties on the one hand and the Indemnified Party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Placement Agent on the other hand shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the Agency Fee received by the Placement Agent. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Placement Agent on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or by the Placement Agent, on the other hand, and the parties' relevant intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement, omission, act or failure to act;  provided that the parties hereto agree that the written information furnished to the Company by the Placement Agent for use in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, consists solely of the Placement Agent's Information relating to the Placement Agent. 
   
 (e)                  Allocation. The Company and the Placement Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to  subsection (d) above were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in the first sent ence of  subsection (d)  above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this  Section 6(e), no Placement Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the total Agency Fee received by such Placement Agent in accordance with  Section 1(b) less the amount of any damages which such Placement Agent has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement, omission or alleged omission, act or alleged act or failure to act or alleged failure to act. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this  Section 6 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Party at law or in equity.

The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this  Section 6 and the covenants, agreements, warranties and representations of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of ( i ) any termination of this Agreement, ( ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Placement Agent, any person who controls such Placement Agent within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act or any affiliate of such Placement Agent, or by or on behalf of the Company, its directors or officers or any person who controls the Company within the m eaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and ( iii) the issuance and delivery of the Securities. The Company and the Placement Agent agree promptly to notify each other of the commencement of any Proceeding against it and, in the case of the Company, against any of the Company's officers or directors in connection with the issuance and sale of the Securities, or in connection with the Registration Statement , the Disclosure Package or the Prospectus.

This provision shall not restrict the number of shares of Common Stock which a Holder may receive or beneficially own in order to determine the amount of securities or other consideration that such Holder may receive in the event of a Fundamental Transaction as contemplated in Section 9 of this Warrant.  This restriction may not be waived. 
   
 5.       Delivery of Warrant Shares. 
   
 (a)       To effect exercises hereunder, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Warrant unless the aggregate Warrant Shares represented by this Warrant are being exercised. Upon delivery of the Exercise Notice (in the form attached hereto) to the Company (with the attached Warrant Shares Exercise Log) at its address for notice set forth herein and upon payment of the Exercise Price multiplied by the number of Warrant Shares that the Holder intends to purchase hereunder and the Company shall promptly (but in no event later than three Trading Days after the Date of Exercise (as defined herein)) issue and deliver to the Holder, a certificate for the Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise, w hich, unless otherwise required by applicable law, shall be free of restrictive legends. A " Date of Exercise" means the date on which the Holder shall have delivered to the Company: (i) the Exercise Notice (with the Warrant Exercise Log attached to it), appropriately completed and duly signed and (ii) if such Holder is not utilizing the cashless exercise provisions set forth in this Warrant, payment of the Exercise Price for the number of Warrant Shares so indicat ed by the Holder to be purchased. 
   
 (b)       If by the third Trading Day after a Date of Exercise the Company fails to deliver the required number of Warrant Shares in the manner required pursuant to Section 5(a), then the Ho lder will have the right to rescind such exercise. 
   
 (c)       If by the third Trading Day after a Date of Exercise the Company fails to deliver the required number of Warrant Shares in the manner required pursuant to Section 5(a), and if after such third Trading Day and prior to the receipt of such Warrant Shares, the Holder purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant Shares which the Holder anticipated receiving upon such exercise (a " Buy-In"), then the Company shall (1) pay in cash to the Holder the amount by which (x) the Holder's total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the amount obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Warrant Shares that the Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise at issue by (B) the closing bid price of the Common Stock at the time of the obligation giving rise to such purchase obligation and (2) at the option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Warrant and equivalent number of Warrant Shares for which such exercise was not honored or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued had the Company timely complied with its exercise and delivery obligations hereunder. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the  amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In. 
   
 
 
 
   A- 3   
 
   
 
   
 (d)       The Company's obligations to issue and deliver Warrant Shares in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or inaction by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against any person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder or any other person of any obligation to the Company or any violation or alleged violation of law by the Holder or any other person, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Company to the Holder in connection with the issuance of Warrant Shares. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder's right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company's failure to timely deliver certificates representing Warrant Shares upon e xercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 
   
 6.       Charges, Taxes and Expenses. Issuance and delivery of Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant shall be made without charge to the Holder for any issue or transfer tax, withholding tax, transfer agent fee or other incidental tax or expense in respect of the issuance of such certificates, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the registration of any certificates for Warrant Shares or Warrants in a name other than that of the Holder. The Holder shall be responsible for all other tax liability that may arise as a result of holding or transferring this Warrant or receiving Warrant Sha res upon exercise hereof. 
   
 7.       Replacement of Warrant. If this Warrant is mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation hereof, or in lieu of and substitution for this Warrant, a New Warrant, but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of such loss, theft or destruction and customary and reasonable indemnity (which shall not include a surety bond), if requested. Applicants for a New Warrant under such circumstances shall also comply with such other reasonable regulations and procedures and pay such other reasonable third-party costs as the Company may prescribe. If a New Warrant is requested as a result of a mutilation of this Warrant, then the Holder shall deliver such mutilated Warrant to the Company as a condition precedent to the Company's obligation to issue the New Warrant. 
   
 8.       Reservation of Warrant Shares. The Company covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued and otherwise unreserved Common Stock, solely for the purpose of enabling it to issue Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant as herein provided, the number of Warrant Shares which are then issuable and deliverable upon the exercise of this entire Warrant, free from preemptive rights or any other contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holder (taking into account the adjustments and restrictions of Section 9). The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares so issuable and deliverable shall, upon issuance and the payment of the applicable Exercise Price in accordance wi th the terms hereof, be duly and validly authorized, issued and fully paid and nonassessable. 
   
 9.       Certain Adjustments. The Exercise Price and number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant are subject to adjustment from time to time as set forth in this Section 9. 
   
 (a)       Stock Dividends and Splits. If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) pays a stock dividend on its Common Stock or otherwise makes a distribution on any class of capital stock that is payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, or (iii) combines outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Exercise Price shall be adjusted to equal the product obtained by multiplying the then-current Exercise Price by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to clause (i) of this paragraph shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, and any adjustment pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph shall become effective immediately aft er the effective date of such subdivision or combination. 
   
 
 
 
   A- 4   
 
   
 
   
 (b)       Fundamental Transactions. If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding there is a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall have the right thereafter to receive, upon exercise of this Warrant, the same amount and kind of securities, cash or property as it would have been entitled to receive upon the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction if it had been, immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction, the holder of the number of Warrant Shares then issuable upon exercise in full of this Warrant (the " Alternate Consideration"). For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction. At the Holder's option and request, any successor to the Company or surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall, either (1) issue to the Holder a new warrant substantially in the form of this Warrant and consistent with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the Holder's right to purchase the Alternate Consideration for the aggregate Exercise Price upon exercise thereof, or (2) purchase the Warrant from the Holder for a purchase price, payable in cash within five Trading Days after such request (or, if later, on the effective date of the Fundamental Transaction), equal to the Black Scholes value of the remaining unexercised portion of this Warrant on the date of such request. The terms of any agreement pursuant to which a Fundamental Transaction is effected shall include terms requiring any such successor or surviving entity to comply with the provisions of this paragraph (b) and insuring that the Warrant (or any such replacement security) will be similarly adjusted upon any subsequent transacti on analogous to a Fundamental Transaction. 
   
 (c)       Number of Warrant Shares. Simultaneously with any adjustment to the Exercise Price pursuant to this Section 9, the number of Warrant Shares that may be purchased upon exercise of this Warrant shall be increased or decreased proportionately, so that after such adjustment the aggregate Exercise Price payable hereunder for the adjusted number of Warrant Shares shall be the same as the  aggregate Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment. 
   
 (d)       Calculations.  All calculations under this Section 9 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100 th of a share, as applicable. The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or held by or for the account of the Company, and the  disposition of any such shares shall be considered an issue or sale of Common Stock. 
   
 (e)       Notice of Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment pursuant to this Section 9, the Company at its expense will promptly compute such adjustment in accordance with the terms of this Warrant and prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment, including a statement of the adjusted Exercise Price and adjusted number or type of Warrant Shares or other securities issuable upon exercise of this Warrant (as applicable), describing the transactions giving rise to such adjustments and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based. Upon written request, the Company will promptly deliver a copy of each such certificate to the Holder and to the Company's transfer agent. 
   
 
 
 
   A- 5   
 
   
 
   
 10.     Payment of Exercise Price.  The Holder may pay the Exercise Price in one of the following manners: 
   
 (a)       Cash Exercise.  The Holder may deliver immediately available funds; or 
   
 (b)       Cashless Exercise. The Holder may notify the Company in an Exercise Notice of its election to utilize a cashless exercise, in which event the Company shall issue to the Holder the number of Warrant  Shares determined as follows: 
   
 X = Y [(A-B)/A]   
   
 where: 
   
 X = the number of Warrant Shares to be issued to the Holder. 
 Y = the number of Warrant Shares with respect to which this Warrant is being exercised. 
A = the average of the Closing Prices for the five Trading Days immediately prior to (but not including) the Exercise Date. 
 B = the Exercise Price.   
   
For purposes of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, it is intended, understood and acknowledged that the Warrant Shares issued in a cashless exercise transaction shall be deemed to have been acquired by the Holder, and the holding period for the Warrant Shares shall be deemed to have commenced, on the date this Warrant was originally issued. 
   
 11.     No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Warrant Shares will be issued in connection with any exercise of this Warrant. In lieu of any fractional shares which would, otherwise be issuable, the Company shall pay cash equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the Closing Price of one Warrant Share on the date of exercise. 
   
 12.     Notices. Any and all notices or other communications or deliveries hereunder (including, without limitation, any Exercise Notice) shall be in writing and shall be deemed given and effective if provided pursuant to the Placement Agency Agreement. In case any time: (1) the Company shall declare any cash dividend on its capital stock; (2) the Company shall pay any dividend payable in stock upon its capital stock or make any distribution to the holders of its capital stock; (3) the Company shall offer for subscription pro rata to the holders of its capital stock any additional shares of stock of any class or other rights; (4) there shall be any capital reorganization, or reclassification of the capital stock of the Company, or consolidation or merger of the Company with, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation; or (5) there shall be a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company; then, in any one or more of said cases, the Company shall give prompt written notice to the Holder. Such notice shall also specify the date as of which the holders of capital stock of record shall participate in such dividend, distribution or subscription rights, or shall be entitled to exchange their capital stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, or conversion or redemption, as the case may be. Such written notice shall be given at least 20 days prior to the action in question and not less than 20 days prior to the record date or the date  on which the Company's transfer books are closed in respect thereto. 
   
 13.     Lock Up. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Warrant, in accordance with FINRA Rule 5110(g), this Warrant shall not be sold during the Offering, or sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, or hypothecated, or be the subject of any hedging, short sale, derivative, put, or call transaction that would result in the effective economic disposition of this Warrant or the Warrant Shares, by any person for a period of 180 days immediately following the date of effectiveness or commencement of sales of the Offering, except as provided in paragrap h (g)(2) of FINRA Rule 5110. 
   
 14.      Transfer; Assignment. Subject to compliance with any applicable securities laws, this Warrant may be transferred or assigned by the Holder without the consent of the Company (including, without limitation, transfers or assignments to the Holder's employees and affiliates). This Warrant may not be assigned by the Company without the written consent of the Holder. 
   
 
 
 
   A- 6   
 
   
 
   
 15.     Miscellaneous. 
   
 (a)       This Warrant shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Subject to the preceding sentence, nothing in this Warrant shall be construed to give to any person other than the Company and the Holder any legal or equitable right, remedy or cause of action under this Warrant. This Warrant may be amended only in writing signed by the Company and the Holder and their successors and assigns. 
   
 (b)       All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Warrant shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the in ternal laws of the State of New York, without regard to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

 (d)       In case any one or more of the provisions of this Warrant shall be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, the validity and enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this Warrant shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and the parties will attempt in good faith to agree upon a valid and enforceable provision which shall be a commercially reasonable substitute therefor, and upon so agreeing, shall incorporate such substitute provision in this Warrant. 
   
 (e)       Prior to exercise of this Warrant, the Holder hereof shall not, by reason of by being a Holder, be entitled to any rights of a stockholder with respect to the Warrant Shares .
