 6.6  Remedies. Executive acknowledges that Executive has carefully read and considered all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the restraints imposed upon him pursuant to Sections 8.1 through 8.5. Executive agrees without reservation that each of the restraints contained herein is necessary for the reasonable and proper protection of the goodwill, Confidential Information and other legitimate interests of the Company Group; that each and every one of those restraints is reasonable in respect to subject matter, length of time and geographic area; and that these restraints, individually or in the aggregate, shall not prevent Executive from obtaining other suitable employment during the period in which Executive is bound by these restraints. Without intending to limit the remedies available to the Company, Executive agrees that a breach (or threatened breach) of any of the covenants contained in Sections 8.1 through 8.5 may result in material and irreparable injury to the Company Group for which there is no adequate remedy at law, that it shall not be possible to measure damages for such injuries precisely and that, in the event of such a breach or threat thereof, the Company shall be entitled to seek a temporary restraining order or a preliminary or permanent injunction, or both, without bond or other security, restraining Executive from engaging in activities prohibited by the covenants contained in Sections 8.1 through 8.5 or such other relief as may be required specifically to enforce any of the covenants contained in this Agreement.

Executive acknowledges and the Company agrees that Executive may disclose Confidential Information in confidence, directly or indirectly, to federal, state, or local government officials, including but not limited to the Department of Justice, the SEC, the Congress, and any agency Inspector General or to an attorney, for the sole purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law or regulation or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of state or federal laws or regulations. Executive may also disclose Confidential Information in a document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, but only if the filing is made under seal. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to conflict with federal law protecting confidential disclosures of a trade secret to the government or in a court filing, 18 U.S.C. § 1833(b), or to create liability for dis closures of Confidential Information that are expressly allowed by 18 U.S.C. § 1833(b). 
 8.  Section 409A. This Agreement is intended to meet, or be exempt from, the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations and interpretive guidance promulgated thereunder (collectively, "Section 409A"), with respect to amounts subject thereto, and shall be interpreted and construed consistent with that intent. No expense s eligible for reimbursement, or  in-kind benefits to be provided, during any calendar year shall affect the amounts eligible for reimbursement in any other calendar year, to the extent subject to the requirements of Sect ion 409A, and no such right to reimbursement or right to  in-kind benefits shall be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. For purposes of Section 409A, each payment in a series of installment payments provided under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment. Any payments to be made under this Agreement upon a termination of employment shall only be made upon a "separation from service" unde r Section 409A. If 
   
 6 
 
 
amounts payable under this Agreement do not qualify for exemption from Section 409A at the time of Executive's separation from service and therefore are deemed deferred compensation subject to the requirements of Section 409A on the date of such separation from service, then if Executive is a "specified employee" under Section 409A on the date of Executive's separation from service, payment of the amounts hereunder shall be delayed for a period of six months from the date of Executive's separation from service if required by Section 409A. The accumulated postponed amount shall be paid in a lump sum within 30 days after the end of the  six-month period. If Executive dies during the postponement period prior to payment of the postponed amount, the amounts withheld on account of Section 409A shall be paid to Executive's est ate within 30 days after the date of Executive's death. 
 9.  Change in Control Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Executive Change in Control and Severance Agreement, dated as of March 9, 2012, between Executive and the Company shall terminate effective as of  the Retirement Date and shall be of no further force and effect. 
 10.  Miscellaneous . 
 10.1 Severability. As the provisions of this Agreement are independent of and severable from each other, the Company and Executive agree that if, in any action before any court or agency legally empowered to enforce this Agreement, any term, restriction, covenant, or promise hereof is found to be unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable, then such decision shall not affect the validity of the other provisions of this Agreement, and such invalid term, restriction, covenant, or promise shall also be deemed modified to the extent necessary to make it enfo rceable.

No delay on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party of any such right, power or privilege nor any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any other or further exer cise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege. 
 10.7  Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but which together shall be one and the same instrument.

 10.9  Withholding. Any payments made to Executive under this Agreement shall be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes or other amounts required to be withheld by law or contract.
