 17 
 
 
 
entering into of any new such agreement in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, shall not be deemed to render any representation or warranty of Seller untrue.

Seller's failure to respond within said five (5) day period shall be conclusively deemed to constitute Seller's election not to remedy such change, in which event Purchaser's election to terminate this Agreement shall stand. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall Seller be liable to Purchaser for, or be deemed to be in default hereunder by reason of any breach of any representation or warranty which results from any change that both (i) occurs between the Effective Date and the Closing Date and (ii) is expressly permitted under the terms of this Agreement or is beyond the reasonable control of Seller to prevent; provided, however, that Purchaser shall have the termination rights described above. If, despite the changes described in any such Seller notice, Purchaser elects to waive the breached representation or warranty and proceed with the Closing, Seller's representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been modified by all statements made in such notice(s).
