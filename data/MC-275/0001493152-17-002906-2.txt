Ltd., with a principal place of business at 10 Golden Tower Bldg. 144-17, Sams ung-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, Korea ("ID") (the " Assignor"), and Document Security Systems, Inc., having a principal place of business at 200 Canal View Blvd., Suite 300, Rochester, New York 14623 (" Assignee "). 
   
Whereas, the Assignor and Assignee have entered into a certain [Patent Purchase Agreement] dated November 10, 2016 (the "Agreement") under which, among other things, Assignor assigns to Assignee all worldwide right, title and interest in and to (i) all patents and patent applications in the name of or owned by Assignor identified and set forth on Appendix A attached hereto, (ii) the invention disclosures identified and set forth on Appendix A attached hereto, and (iii) with respect to (i) and (ii), all national (of any country of origin) and multinational patents, patent applications and provisional patent applications, and reissues, divisions, continuations, continuations-in-part, continuing patent applications, extensions and reexaminations thereof, and all rights therein provided by multinational treaties or conventions (such patents and patent applications, the "PATENTS"); and 
   
Whereas, pursuant to the Agreement, Assignor wishes to assign to Assignee, and Assignee wishes to acquire from Assignor, all worldwide right, title and interest in and to the PATEN TS. 
   
For good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows: 
   
1.       Pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Assignor, does hereby irrevocably sell, assign, transfer, and convey unto Assignee, or Assignee's de signees, all of Assignor's right title and interest in and to the PATENTS, together with: 
   
(a)	the right, if any, to register, prosecute, maintain and defend the PATENTS before any public or private agency, office or registrar; 
   
(b) 	all rights of cooperation that have been pledged or assigned to Assignor with respect to the PATENTS; (c)	the right to sue and bring any causes of action (whether currently pending, filed or otherwise) and all other enforcement rights and rights to remedies under, on account of, or related to any of the PATENTS and/or any item in any of the foregoing categories including, without limitation, all causes of action and other enforcement rights for (i) damages, (ii) injunctive relief, and (iii) other remedies of any kind for past, current and future infringement, misappropriation or violation of rights and all rights to sue for any of the foregoing; and 
   
(c)	all rights to collect royalties and other payments under or on account of any of the PATENTS, as well as all rights to assign or sell an interest in such royalties or other pay ments to third parties. 
   
2.       Assignor hereby authorizes the respective patent office or governmental agency in each jurisdiction to issue any and all PATENTS, certificates of invention, utility models or other governmental grants or issuances that may be granted upon any of the PATENTS in the name of Assignee, as the assignee to the entire interest therein, to record Assignee as the assignee and owner of the PATENTS and to deliver to Assignee, and to Assignee's attorneys, agents, successors or assigns, all official documents and communications as may be  warranted by this Assignment. 
   
3.       Assignor shall use best efforts to take actions and execute and deliver documents that Assignee may reasonably request to effect the terms of this Assignment and to perfect Assignee's title in and to those PATENTS assigned to it hereunder. In the event that Assignee is unable for any reason whatsoever to secure Assignor's signature to any document it is entitled to under this Assignment, Assignor hereby irrevocably designates and appoints Assignee, and its duly authorized officers and agents, as Assignor's agent and attorney-in-fact to act for and on its behalf and instead of it, to execute and file any such document and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the purposes of this Assignment  with the same legal force and effect as if executed by Assignor. 
   
4.       This Assignment is intended to effect the assignment of the PATENTS to Assignee as described in the Agreement. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Assignment and the Agreement, the Agreement shall prevail and govern the rights and obligations of the Parties hereto and the scope of assignment of the  PATENTS. 
   
The terms and conditions of this Assignment will inure to the benefit of Assignee, its successors, assigns, and other legal representatives consistent with the Agreement between the Parties executed on the same date as this Assignment and will be binding upon Assignor, its successors, assigns, and other legal representatives. 
   
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
   
In witness whereof, intending to be legally bound, the Parties have executed this Assignment as of the Assignment Date.
